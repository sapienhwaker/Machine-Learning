Then you get sober and when your family asks why you did it, you tell them well....I got way to many fucking upvotes.

downvoatYess I was the 500tb uptoke!! I’ve never seen a score so high. Are upvotes your higher power? If it can be a rock or a doorknob, then I don’t see why not. Good luck to youHow come there so many negative person latelly if you dont have anything nice to say and take your anger out on a post like this that was made only for fun then idk what to tell you tbh its just pathetic..JUST ENJOY LIFE AND SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON..oh it it also christmas how can you hate on anyone on the 25 COME ON NO MORE HATE AND SMILE AWAY FRIEND.And next time u wanna hate just go jerk one off even tho its gonna take 2hrs on dope but oh well <3 everybody.Fuck off!

I know i could easily make it a few days, might make a [serious] tagged one thats upvote/hourCan’t believe you’re already at a month. not so much evil as much as the kind of people i want to challenge me to push myself!!! (without depriving myself of too much pleasure, simultaneously)It is I. Bah humbug. [deleted]do you really love me cuz i just went through some troubles parsing that with someone else for reals...whats that mean? NG for clean?Wow! i wasnt sure if i could really pull it off, but with this huge outpouring of support, i might actually find the motivation to stay clean for the whole 3.5 hours!! :o)tell that to every dumbass post i see on the front page from r/drunk.....seriously, look at their top posts and tell me that whole sub shouldnt be bannedi wish i had any decent dboys locally.....unfortunately its fent all the way down :(
We ALL live with some level of cognitive dissonance see i was gonna do that, but then i was like "~200+ days is like more than half a year...." the longest clean time ive had in recent memory is exactly 6 months last year so I know i could do it, but do i want to? nope!luckily ive got a couple days' head-start so as long as we dont hit OVER 24 hours ill be coolingits almost like, id have to seek treatment of my own volition for it to work?yo olDurty you're one of the very few who could redeem a downvoat IRL for a taste of my poppy production plantthank you i love this and you. 

> And next time u wanna hate just go jerk one off even tho its gonna take 2hrs on dope but oh well <3 everybody.

merry dopemasfuck youshit, just trying to have some fun w a joke you wankerDon't fucking tell me what to do trust me. with the shit i've been through in life i'm tired and have absolutely no reason to lie. Not going Going for clean.That's quite hypocritical considering you just made a shit post worse than the stuff I see on r/drunkHaha and I want actually directing it towards you I don't know your story just seemed funnysorry but who the fuck cares how many upvotes you get, if you want to change your life for the better and get sober go fucking do it instead of pandering for meaningless internet points

nobody cares, nobody cares...Go fuck yourselfwell thanks (your preferred neutral gender pronoun), i wish i knew you better so my love rebuttal would sound sincere at leastGotta hit this bitch with a [serious] tag So tell me sensei, where does a more degenerate r/drunk post belong if not on r/opiates No where. reddit nobody wants to see shitty karma grab posts. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I laughed 🤷‍♂️, Content: , ups: 1536, downs: 0That was me, sorry guys. Got my first reddit gold in 4 years for it though lol. Found this sub reddit because of that comment. Gotta love redditYes. I think one guy was a month. He had to go to the ER. Ahh yes. The dreaded encounter with the concrete python. Don’t judge but I had to use my wife and I Astro glide once to lube up my rear end so it would slide out.  It worked pretty damn good!Hey that’s the only reason why I’m surfing this reddit! I’m actually quite intrigued people here are abusing and are addicted. I thought it was about pharmacology....
Damn. He got us. Discovered this sub from there and thanks for the laughs going through a shitty time and y’all made me chuckle *laughs in linzess*I know a junkie from my little town, he didn't pooped for 24days, I don't know if this was the cause, but now he has severe colon cancer... 
On nucynta for pain management. Legit haven't shat in four days. I just wanna poop man!I took a huge shit around midnight because I had my last little piece saved for my final time using before I try and kick again. After cleaning out my bowels pretty well, I did my first and last booty bump. I have never slammed and I know I couldn’t do it just once, so I prepped 0.3 of some tar and I sent that dark slime up my ass. I was nervous about it coming out so i jumped down on my stomach and laid there for about ten minutes. I got pretty high but still didn’t catch a nod. I don’t know why but no matter how much i do or how i administer it, heroin gives me speed like energy and meth calms me down. Pointless story but I shit at midnight.Two solid bowl movement today. Roll Tide.

Diet, exercise, and hydration are key if you dont want to feel like shit and not be able to shit.I went here from thatI’m glad I made you laugh :)

I wrote that right before going to bed and now when I woke up, I saw it had 14 k upvotes  xDYou can’t poop if you never eat... 
r/stimsonce a year Since 2008 (when I started getting on opiates) I’d go atleast 3-4 weeks without having any bowel movements. Now that I’ve been on Adderall for 2 years now as well I’ve found that it helps even out opiate constipation. I pooped like 4 times since 2018 endedI love you guysI came from there lolI came onto this subreddit because of that comment i giggle snorted
I’m currently on another few-week problem shits that I’m trying to resolve. It’s at that point where it’s starting to hurt my stomach, it’s kind of a cycle lol. I feel like I haven’t taken a proper shit in months.You ever push so hard you ejaculate?Taking a shit as I read this lmaoPretty sure I've got one stuck from '99How about for the ladies; who can go the longest without a period?? I’m looking to go three years in a rowFam I've made it CRAZY amounts of time without doing a NUMBER 2, Pretty sure when I FIRST got on the methadone, it took ages to adjust to my dose and I didn't go for 2 months (possibly even longer, that's how scared I was to go) . Needless to say, when I finally did go, it sounded like a demon was being exorcised. Obviously, I was controlling my eating during this period, and i'm not a big fan of food anyway so not eating for long amounts of time doesn't bother me. After you don't go for a week and then you have a 5lb shit it's called having a heroin baby.The relief is gonna be so sweet mannnnlmao, well, they aren't wrong...It was like right there almost crowning lol guiltyOh my God ���Is anyone familiar with skin problems due to what I can only assume is from long term constipation? The symptoms are like skin all over my body is constantly flaking and like shedding these little specs of black, grey, or tan. It’s like a plaque buildup on my nails and cuticles also. Been dealing with this purgatory for literally years. Been to dozens of doctors but no fix, maybe bc I don’t admit to them that I use Fentanyl and previously tar. Any help would be eternally appreciated, if I could pay for a cure no price would seem unreasonable, like this has been ruining my life.It was you!! 2.1k opiate users in 2 hours. I wish that was surprising. [deleted]Welcome come check out the place and see what it’s like to be an addict. I always enjoy people seeing what it’s really like because it somewhat de-stigmatizes it some what. 

My only concern is whenever we are mentioned on the front page or something we get a bunch of people coming here telling us to kill ourselves and we’re fucking junkie scum and all that. welcome, welcome.Yeah I hit 3 weeks one time. It felt like I had a 6 foot curved concrete turd in me. My hemorrhoids were under so much pressure my asshole probably looked like a head of cauliflower. It hurt to walk. After I started to vomit feces I knew I was close to dying. I went to the ER and they said, "you need to go poop, take a laxitive" and sent me home. Like I hadn't been eating them all day for a week. The next day I fought the beast for 5 hours, digging little bits out at a time with my index finger. At this point my asshole was raw, bleeding, and my hemmies felt like giant stretched out balloons. I took one more push with all the strength in my body and a Pringles can sized turd ripped my ass wide open. It was simultaneously the most painful and liberating feeling in my life. I couldn't wipe so I just got on all fours in the shower and let it clean me. I remember the feeling. Shaking. About to pass out. The feeling of the monster moving out of my ass before I could get my finger out. Horrible horrible month it was.OMGI heard a nurse ends up needing to use her hand at that point. Not sure how true My doctor recommended to put on a glove and then oil up my butthole and the inside of my anus with veggie oil right before I go to prevent tearing and to make it a little less painful. Seriously?my butthole is litterally in pain thinking about this.


i mean that generally the normal response once i start thinking, but that's not the point!That might have been meI'm sober now, but when I was in the throes of my addiction I'd sometimes bust out an enema. No judgements here �I've legit dug poop out my ass in desperation once. It was both discussing and satisfying at the same time.

I have severe RA and narcotics are my only source of pain relief.Thats true loveI can never get lube to work. I keep a box of latex gloves right next to the shitter for those stubborn days. ��
This place is full of degenerates and foul mouthed people doing stupid stuff. It's a wonderful place. pharmacology is discussed very frequently here. Hey man, tomato tomatoeI’m a chronic pain patient who takes her prescribed medication as directed, but I’m no better than anyone else here. And neither are you. I'm literally also only here cause of this post... But enjoying reading the stories here quite a bit! Praying for everyone here to have a safe year.

Edit: typo/r/stims is good tooHow do you find Nucynta for helping w pain? Ive only taken it recreationally and it was fucking awful for me. Made me feel 10x worse than I already did (withdrawals) so i wrote it off as “never touch again”. But ive heard it mentioned more and more in a postive light here recently. Same for me. I always attributed that to my ADHD. For 24 hoursI'd stare at a computer and learn how to build Android apps on meth. If I wanted the house clean I'd use opiates Too bad you couldn’t have timed it so one piece splashed down right at 11:59 and 9/10ths of a second and continued to splash until 12:00 and 1/10ths of a second while up above another piece had just breached the hole so you would have been probably one of very few who had the very last and first poop of the year.. 18&19 respectively.   
Well I guess we have something to aim for this year on New Years... only 363 days to go. I’m gonna go eat some fiber and Taco Bell.You shit so hard the bowl moved? Or movantikAre you following around your own posts? I don’t know why yours so proud of 14 votes one time I got 19 and then I upvoted it and it went to 20. Haagen daz and heroinStay for the heroin and life of crime.Same lolShow off...Hahahahahah that's awesome! My ex wife went about that long too. 

Quick question. If you aren't having your period does that also mean you don't ovulate? Which in turn means you couldn't get pregnant? I'm one of us it's ok.[deleted]Vomiting …feces? YikesDear lord...This had be dying laughing at work partially because of how relatable it is...I write as I sit on the shitter excreting tiny rock hard pebbles of pooGod. Damn.Holy shitYou honestly just made me cry laughing. I am so sorry that shit happened to you, pun intended I guess.I loled. How could you go that far?!? I had my moments on methadone, but gd, 1 week is *forever* to not poop.He was a hurting dude. Usually true, or some kind of digging tool, or possibly even surgery. At that point things are so compacted bowel movements aren't possible anymore and it has to be removed by some other means. [deleted]i had to have what is called a ‘fecal disimpaction” done at one point. it was painful. they did give me IV dilaudid and ativan though which was nice. Also professionally known as *digital extraction*.Quite common. My mom was a nurse and I suffered from constipation as a kid. If I couldn't get it out, and was on the toilet crying and suffering. She would glove and lube up, and helped get it started to come out for me, as she was taught.
Nowadays the nurses tell you to do it yourself and hand you some gloves. Yes. I knew a woman who was very lucky to not get a colostomy bag. They removed several feet of dead intestine. So yes this can happen.Read my story in this thread. SeriouslyYes. I searched but nothing. I try to go every three days. After that, pain is a sure thing. I couldn't find your postYea enemas were my saving grace, is it bad that I looked forward to it, because it felt nice to get that outWhat's RA?I had to do that a couple of weeks ago. My poor boyfriend sat in the bathroom with me while I cried cuz I was in so much pain. The man is a trooper. “That’s black love.” — Whitney Houston, after husband Bobby Brown assisted her with this problem, using internal manipulation with his fingers. (For you youngsters, Whitney and Bobby had a reality show that followed their day-to-day lives, and this incident was documented.)I’m not an opiate user but I have used in the past and still visit this sub. Just want to say thank you for actually coming to the sub and not saying something disrespectful or unnecessary. There are good genuine people hear. 

Usually when this sub is mentioned else where it’s extremely talked down upon.If you shoot them it makes your butthole tingle.It's the only pain killer that for some reason I don't build much of a tolerance for, which is awesome because I hate upping doses on medications.

It's expensive AF though.

Thankfully my withdrawal symptoms when I stop cold turkey are pretty mild.

I like it for pain management :)Don't they give you amphetamines for adhd?The world needs people like us. Truly I honestly think the crazy can’t sit still dreamers and tinkerers with a hand in every pot kind of people drive creativity and invention and have pushed the human race towards all kinds of new and exciting and great things. Else we’d still be sitting around a fire that some guy made with sticks eating the same shit we did yesterday in some dark part of Africa or Europe. But one day a gene mutated and even though little eddy got yelled at a lot as a kid and was always in trouble he said fuuuuuck this I’m going over there with this stick and that one too maybe this rock hey where’d I put my other rock thing anyhow yeah I’m outta here.. few hundred thousand years later here I am same mutation from a long line of annoying always getting into trouble Eddy’s wondering what to do next.Unmedicated, working on 150 different projects I'll never finishHaha could have sworn I said bowel... I'm going to blame autocorrect. I am known to bring the thunder though. > side effects: withdrawal symptoms

Methylnaltrexone 14 thousand.. I got notifications and I mean if one of my posts or comments get a lot of upvotes I get happy? Woah that was the biggest mindfuck. 

I don’t think so though because I still have to be really careful about getting pregnant/giving birth to a opioid dependent baby... I don’t want to me THAT person ya know. Also I think we still go trough “PMS” everything but the blood... and pain. Sometimes I get frustrated or emotional and I think to myself “is this my phantom period...?”[deleted]WEEEEENYup. That's sign your colon is so full that your small intestine shoots nasty black bile shit up through your stomachReminds me of South Park when they are shitting out their mouth.>Vomiting ...feces?

There’s another condition that causes that but I can’t quite remember what it is. (Probably more than one, but one in particular I heard about not too long ago.)

It, too, was an intestinal blockage, but with a different underlying cause. Same result, though — feces eventually comes up the wrong way and ... horrorshow.Had it happen to me..  not from opiates but for an unknown reason. I was 14 at the time and it was horrible and scary. Ended up going to the ER after 19 days of no shitting and they put a tube up my nose all the way down my throat then into my stomach and they pumped 2 gallons of a special liquid into me and it took like 12 hours to kick in but once it did, I was shitting straight water. I was still in the hospital and if I didn’t have my butt cheeks clenched then shit would spray down my legs and everytime I stood up to go to the toilet I’d have extremely watery poop come out and it left a trail everytime :d 

They left the tube in for 2 days but took it out early because I ended up throwing up poop AGAIN and the tube came up and I started choking on it so the nurses came in after I was choking for 2 minutes and by the time they got there I was already UNCONSCIOUS 


When I left the hospital they weighed me and I lost 14 pounds i once went about 2 weeks.....after my time in the hospital.


being on methadone, vicodins, and not moving because of a broken leg made it so bad. I was one day from going to the ER. I was litterally crying in bed. I took like every laxative, enema, magnesium sulfate, etc. Like I couldn't even pee, that's how constipated i was


then at 3AM....the whole house was greeted to my shouting "AHAHAHAHAHA!!!! FUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK YOOOOOU!!!"


to which i heard my dad shout in a half awake voice "get that shit outta here!"


XD[deleted]This is how you scare kids off of drugs*nods knowingly*>fecal disimpaction

I'm saddened this isn't a Cannibal Corpse or Dying Fetus songI dont know if i could ever look at my mom the same way after her fingers being in my bunghole..Fuck!!Oh it was a comment months ago. I hadn't shat in like a month I eventually had to go to the ER for an emergency enema in the middle of the nightThere are few things in this world that provide such relief and euphoria as finally managing a shit after a week or two. 

I solved my two-week stint with loads of spicy food and gallons of coffee. I've left the experience behind, but have been carrying the resulting caffeine addiction since. It was the only thing that ensured I had a daily movement for a while after that. Rhumeatoid ArthritisRheumatoid arthritisI'd guess possibly rheumatoid arthritis Tianeptine (highly discourage anyone from shooting Tia. Very dumb)  would do that same thing. First time i thought i like pissed myself or something. HahaYes but it has a milder effect for us with adhd than for those without. It does still stimulate to a degree but at the same time helps focuses the mind ON ONE THING. The inability to stay focused for any good period of time is probably the worst of the symptoms of the disorder. Welcome to the Thunderdome!Both were just jokes. Yeah I understand how it works and it really was a clever comment. It takes on a new meaning here where a good poop is an event not just a daily occurrence.Damn son! Sounds fucking roughThe relief is intense. Dear God, I'm so sorry! I had gone about that long myself, and it was beyond a horrific experience getting that "concrete shit baby" out! 
I mean, I bled, for months after, everytime I had to go #2. I wouldn't want to eat even when starving bc ik it would have to come out and it was so painful my body and mind was like fuck eating. I drank alot of ensure and smoothirs during that time, but still. Anyway sorry if TMI. I just dont think people quite understand how absolutely painful extreme constipation and the aftermath can be. I had one when I first got on methadone that was literally ass cheek bone to ass cheek bone and the size of a softball. It was also a 2 weeker.I can honestly say I have gone at least 3 1/2 weeks to 4 without any movement in my bowels. Bf was freaking out, saying I have to go to the ER! I have never in my life been regular, but I did have to deal with the discomfort, on H that all disappeared, you don’t have a digestive system anymore! It just goes into hibernation! And yes the most intense was the almost 4 week mark, but I had to remind him 4 out of 7 days I wasn’t eating much more than a pint of Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked and a coke...so I wasn’t putting much in. Still not so happy I have to eat and shit, just wish I could do away with those! You’re giving me flashbacks to 2005 bro chill. I read this sub to fall asleep. Without nightmares. It absolutely should be. Dang why didn't I think of that. ThanksYup Tia was my last and final relapse. Shot it for 6 months and I'm not joking, I literally have no veins left except my dick and femoral. My neck has hardened up and has a very serious abscess at a point. My forearms and kneews were wrecked. All for a high that loses the magic in 2 days. It's the insanity thinking it'll be "different the next shot I'll do more" and "I won't get injured I'm not like them" well both of those happened and quick. Avoid this drug as much as possibleI’ve not been near your 2 week record but after only like 5 days my shit was so hard and impossible to move. 

Had to reach in there and break parts off. Is that bad? It passed eventually though lolI've been on heroin for over 6 years now, and though I see these kind of complaints really often, I don't get why you put yourselves through it. When I'd not been on heroin for long and just picked up a habit and was in a situation where the H was practically unlimited, one time I ended up constipated for 2 weeks and then having really awful abdominal and bowel pain for a couple of hours until I finally had the biggest shit of my life. It was a traumatic experience and though I look back on it amused now, going through it was hell. Since then to avoid it I just make sure that every 2 or 3 days I hold off on my morning dose until I've taken a shit. Sure, I'd rather take a shot as soon as I wake up, but I only have to endure an hour or 2 of the mild beginning withdrawal symptoms before I can go to the bathroom and then I'm all good and can take my hit. It's a mild inconvenience but it's a damn sight better than writhing around in agony on the toilet trying to give birth out my ass at 3 in the morning. Why doesn't everyone do this??? anybody that takes opiates everyday or often should also be taking a stool softener everyday. since i started taking my zub i couldn’t go #1 or #2 for a week but now that i incorporate the softener i’ve not had a problem since [deleted]Tia is like shooting elmers glue. Its use/abuse is not sustainable whatsoever. Hats off to you for staying away from it. I never got hooked to it, just used it in desperate times. Its withdrawals are supposed to be rough arent they? I think I remember reading its got SSRI-like properties or something along those lines?When you were young and naive... but now you are... **THE POOPSHIPDESTROYER**This is just all too relatable...I closed my eyes and saw myself, frozen still with every muscle in my body tensed, sweat building at my hairline and feeling that first of many pain-sweats trickle down the side of my face, focusing all my strength on pushing out what I already know is damn impossible to do with injury...grabbing toilet paper and basically picking the rock out of my asshole....here’s to a better year and more Metamucil<3 Ween![deleted]I’m having vivid flashbacks. When I got done with detox and into rehab they gave me Miralax and I fucking loved it. I’d get so fucking hyped when I needed to shit. It was � as the kids say. lost in the sauce once again

&#x200B;This thread is fucking gold @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 21 years ago I quit heroin, Benzos, meth, and alcohol., Content: , ups: 1476, downs: 0I’m coming up on 2 years March 1. Happy anniversary! �Congrats, that’s amazing! You're awesome!! ���

Keep inspiring and helping people Tracey, you're amazing.21 years...wow! Congrats!!
I wish I could make it to 1 year....Thank you for everything you've done for this community Tracey.  You have pushed harm reduction, saved lives with Narcan, and I think most importantly helped HUMANIZED us "worthless addicts" to a larger populace.  

I, like thousands of people in this subreddit, appreciate the fuck out of you.  I've got 4 years heroin free and am considering getting a career change into addiction therapy - if I can help a percentage of the people you have I will consider my life a success. 

Congrats again, and much love!That's a really huge accomplishment!! Congratulations �Man, I can't imagine what that detox was like. My best friend hung him self while detoxing after a monstrous run on meth heroin and benzos in January. Thanks for spreading the word, showing us how it can he done.So, is an ice cream guaranteed with 21 years of sobriety?!?!

Lol!

Congratulations!! You are an inspiration and I am so proud of you!So, my standard question - do you find the clean life boring? 

A lot of people here seem to have this as a big concern.

You know, cause chasing dope is so much fun and all. 

Would be interested in your opinion. Super congratulations!Tracey! From The Dark End of The Street??Hell yeah, congratulations!!It’s crazy to me that you’re part of this sub with all of us and that I’m able to communicate with you, after seeing the Dark End of the Street in 8th grade lol congratulations on 21 years, happy for your sobrietyAmazing!

Im 28 right now and struggling with staying clean from black which isnt good considering im on parole with a 4 year suspended prison sentence, so the stakes are so high... Too bad they dont know how fucking hard it is to come off this shit. I was on suboxone program 3 yrs ago and then got the vivitrol shot after i was released from jail last year and my countys(San Jose- Santa Clara county, CA)program is so fucked they said because i have gotten the vivitrol shot, thats now my ONLY option, and i cant switch to the sub or methadone program. So stupid. Either way youre still an inspiration and its awesome that youre from my area(as in the SF Bay AREA)Kudos to you amigo I know how that goes my go to combo is Adderall,benzos, and some sort of opiate. I drink alcohol with them if it’s around but letting anything have a hold on you isn’t worth it in the end but yet we still continue to do shit we know we shouldn’t.. glad you’re free from it I’d love to swap stories lol good luck to you and have a nice day �Just got 7 months myself! I remember seeing your story on a documentary, thanks for the inspiration. We do recover that's absolutely amazing, congrats : ) i'd love to give you gold but i'm poor, so here: �MMmmmmm heroin and ice cream.

I know you've been on tv before, but did you happen to be in a documentary around the time the picture on the left was taken? I watched one on youtube awhile ago and the image on the left looks like a person that was on it. Just wondering!That’s beyond awesome!! How did you do detox? I’m in a similar boat to you 21 years ago, and I need and want off!  I just can’t seem to do it.. congrats again, and dm me if you have the opportunity, I’m looking for anything to get me to the better side.. Thank you!Girl you should be in charge of your cities harm reduction.  Ive never come across anyone more dedicated at helping people, really helping people with no hidden agenda to inflate your ego or self worth. I'm half way round the world from you and am involved in harm reduction in my city by being a therapist for teen addicts, and almost everyone on the team knows about your story.

Just want to let you know you're being a worldwide inspiration.  Keep it up.Congrats Mama! Thank you for all of your dedication and hard work...you are a the best! you look exactly like the chick from the black tat heroin documentary unless you are her...Awesome. Loved the book and your interview on the dopey podcast. Congrats. [deleted]Congrats!!!you look soooo good!  looking forward to your book, keep us posted Wow. Big props to you! I’ve very proud of you. Your an icon for all of us that are clean or trying to get clean. Thank you so much for your post I've seen the doc you were in on YouTube- it was moving. Thank you for sharing your hope - recovering heroin & crack addict- 5.5 yrs clean. Congrats girl[deleted]You’re amazing!!!Wow so amazing! Congrats! Be proud!Congratulations! 37 days. I’m bored.Holy shit! Congratulations. I remember seeing you in an opiate documentary a few years back, and was so sad to hear that you had continued to use after the doc ended. Your story was really impactful to me at the time. I hope you are doing well. Much love ❤️ Way to go!Tracy, you are killing it! Thank you for all that you are/do! Xx.You in the rooms?? You know, the rooms where one says "clean" rather than "sober"?? 

Would love to meet you. Shoot me a message if you're ever in the central valley to chair a meeting =] 

I know I can watch a documentary about you, but there's nothing like hearing such a powerful message right from the addict's mouth. 

I remember you from that HBO doc. That's amazing !  Keep on Keeping on!Badass! Good on ya, broCongrats Thanks for all you do!Fuck yeah Tracey. You give us all hope.you are fucking awesomeStr8 off the set of MomThank you Tracy :)[deleted]Your a legend Tracy, congrats from AustraliaMaking a life-changing decision requires enormous amount of strength and braveness. You must be one proud lady.  
By the way, bon appétit with this charmingly delicious looking ice cream!Congratulations!!! ���Amazing!!METH?  3% success rate.  Do you still get cravings?Congratulations that’s amazing!!Omg I hope you’re super proud of yourself, you should be ! It’s good to see people do it :) Congratulations Tracey, it is a huge accomplishment!! Thank you for all you do for our community, you truly are a lifesaver !! I’ve done that method, and it did work, I also stayed clean for a few years after, my situation is going on 6 months now, the last two being a continuous “I’m not going to touch that shit again” and the longest I’ve gone is close to 48hours... 

Anyway, congrats on having a life, and keeping that shit out of yours! I hope I’ve shot my last shot, I was planning on it this week, I made it until today, and the vomiting and physical weakness decided it was going to let me mindfuck myself into using today so I can take care of my responsibilities. 

My apologies to the community that could have done without my “poor me” I can’t quit shit.. I know this post is about the strong woman, who hasn’t picked back up, like my dumbass..You truly are an inspiration and a saint for all you do. EDIT- you also look GREAT!I'm sorry for your loss.  Ow is addicted to ice cream and Reddit. Better than H and meth tho! Good jobThanks to you answering my messages I obtained the narcan that ultimately saved my life and I am heading to rehab for the first and hopefully only time in the next week. Thanks for all that you do![deleted]Congrats homie!! ���An amazing feat, for an amazing woman!! Congratulations Tracy!!! ❤️Congrats!!Dark end of the streetSo fucking amazing Tracey! I am so happy for you. Thank you for all you have done for the members here, and addicts in general. Your story really is an inspiration! I knew as soon as I read that headline it was you!!!!
Congratu-fucking-lations�❤️���⭐��️��️✔️I have followed your story for a while, since I first saw the doc,  and then opiophila, and on to reddit. 21 years is incredible. Takes a ton of strength. Congrats and wish you all the best moving forward I remember you from the BTH documentary, glad to see you're still around :)I read your book in prison just a great memoir thank you so much!TRACEY what a fuckin success story you are. I love everything you do for this community. You are seriously the best kind of recovered addict. I hope you continue to inspire and touch people's lives, and get more people well. 

Thanks to you, and reading your story, I decided it was time to do Suboxone maintenance. I'm proud to say I've been on suboxone for over 4 years now, and my taper will end soon (down to 1mg a day!). I continue to look to you as a source of inspiration. 

Thank you, Tracey. On behalf of the community.I'm 21 and you're an example since I discovered that you're alive after the documentary. Hope you're feeling well and thanks for your help in the community.WOO HOO ��‍♀️��
You rock!!!!Mad respect Lucky DUCK.......PRAY FORM__Congratulations!! That's almost my whole life, but again congrats, it's really an achievement!  You really spread some hope in the world. I hope someday to be able to get my hands on your "The Big Fix: Hope After Heroin".. Here in Italy I really struggled some time ago to find it, thinking now about buying it in english on Amazon... This is what I and other addicts in recovery wish and strive for. Congratulations to the max This brought me a lot of joy. Dark end of the street is a favorite of mine, seen it so many times. Its just too real, so happy you got your life back when you did.Wow! I have been sober for almost 3 years now, but this is motivation and proof it is possible to change your destiny! :) Thank you for sharing!Congratulations Tracy. You have been a great inspiration to me and my wife. We now have 16 Months clean time after 15 years of heavy use. Without people like you and our maintenance program we never would be where we are today.  We are finally getting custody of our 4 year old daughter and have our own apartment and the trust and support of our family again. Huge congratulations are due. And huge thanks too, for everything you do for harm reduction online and offline. Amazing willpower! Great work, ma'am! Because of you, I ate a pint of Haagen-Dazs mint chip ice cream last night.

I mean, there's some addictions you just don't get over.i make a point to carry spare fresh rigs and narcan, but im not sure what else i can do. Any tips?Ur truly an inspiration to us all. I totally recall seeing you in the HBO doc. Come such a long way congratulations!!! I have been working on it myself but I seem to get 6 months an then break back to bad habbits. Hopefully I'll get it right one day sooner then laterCongrats traceyh. And hi from a follower on twitter :)Congrats!! ���  and to many more years! Were you in a documentary about addiction? 

Edit: never mind. Should have read the thread before postingI remember seeing you in that BTH documentary before seeing you on here. Kind of surreal.[deleted][deleted]Thanks. That’s rad!THAnk you � Thank you ❤️❤️❤️Wait who dis? He the one who send out narcan? Thank you A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

Thank you Thank you !!!I was ❤️Here I am :)Cause she loves usI do harm Reduction services here and since I’ve been doing OD Prevention for 20 years, opioids don’t bother me. I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week Harm reduction.why not?To give advice and share the experience of overcoming addiction? Maybe?
Idk if you are genuinely worried that this may be a trigger for hrr, or just being a jerk.Do some research on her. She's pretty much a harm reduction legend, on and offline. The name is Tracey Mitchell Helton (hope I didn't misremember sth here) and she's mainly known for her appearance in the HBO documentary black tar heroin the dark end of the street in the 90s and has written books on the subject. Can only recommend the documentary, I've seen it more times than I can count. One of the best drug documentaries out there. ;) Why not?Shes an inspiration and it motivates people. If you've seen the documentary back in the day you'd know if she can do it any of us can do it.I've been clean for 16 months. I like to come here because this is where people need the most help and support.Dumbest question of the month award.It's a she, but yeah, she did that amongst other things. Shh!Bad botBad bot. This bot is dumb as hellTy Tracie. Drug policies should be legislated with people like you, and fuck off the pharma lobbies, but money, I know.
Thank you again.What clicked the last time? I sort of know myself and know I’ll always want to chip and think I can without getting a habitTy internet stranger.
 In this sub I find more support and compassion than IRL.
Your words had really made my day. 
Thank you so much.Gosh i hope youre right, im coming up on 3 years and i still struggle with cravings pretty regularly... I was clean for a year and 3 months off benzos and heavy heroin use, do you think my brain will reset back to noraml, because as the time went on iT was getting worse and after year i thought things would be good again. I ended up getting back on my medication for my My depression an anxiety. IF you dont mind me asking, do you take any medications? Crazy to be talking to you! Probably in my top films of all timeAwesome! Seriously shit aint easy. I beat opiates and alcohol and now coming off benzos. I can only imagine all four for that long. Not many can do it and it is no small victory for anyone, it is huge! Have fun !!!!Yeah I've seized off them before sadly because I was a dumbass lol; I'm prescribed them now thankfully but the xanax here is all still pressed pills so I gotta quit when I can before I get fent. 

Thanks for the response, you're a real lifesaver and this community is blessed by someone offering harm reduction, gives me motivation to stay off opiates seeing what you've done! 

Also, I live in an area with needles/cookers/cotton all available at the pharmacy no questions asked so if you ever run out of supplies or something for the kits I've seen you send out feel free to message me and I'll do what I can to help; just wanted to throw that out there.Yea i know... All because this dude didnt wanna have to go do a little time for a possession charge and be dopesick so instead he sets me up, house gets raided by swat and i get caught up with 7 oz of coke half oz of heroin lsd mdma and 40 plants.It’s on YouTube. I forget the name but if I remember right it’s filmed in San Francisco. Sorry I haven’t seen it in a few years Haha thanks, I will, but it's all the more reason to pull through given it's possible to do it cold turkey. ;D tho usually I relapsed in less than 48hrs, despite meds and even ibogaine once lmao. 



Anyways, happy celebrations if you celebrate this day! :3Thank you �Word, thank u. And yeah, 90 days on March 5th, suboxone and low dose klonopin only.Were ludes really all they are made out to be it is that just nostalgia?You look fabulous btw. what was it lik3 banging dope back in the day. im sure it was alot harder to score without cellphones lol. and you know where any of the other in the documentary are . dead alive or still using. clean?!?!? thanks ispiring story. was a good watch :)Whoa I was talking about your older interview. That’s so crazy that your tonight’s guest too. I’m listening now. That’s soooooo crazy lol. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dopey-dark-comedy-drug-addiction-heroin-cocaine-meth/id1077823917?mt=2&i=1000418919114
That’s amazing. Hopefully you’ll inspire someone to get clean. Keep up the good work Hey, I checked out the documentary. I started hanging out in SF shooting dope in 1998. I posted a link in the private sub to an article w an interview w my running buddy out there. 

21 years is fucking great. I had 13 years and fucked up, but I'm back on the suboxone now. Anyways, congrats again, keep on rocking in the free world!Thank you , after many of nights spent shivering in a hot bath barley holding my head above water and shitting and puking my soul out I'm a hell of a lot better , first time sober in almost 15 yearsThere’s other things?Lol to be fair I was stoned when I watched it. Regardless, glad you’re doing well:)[deleted]I cant believe you take the time to reply to everyone!! i saw you the "Black tar heroin: dark end of the street" many years ago when i was in the peak of my substance use; I really identified with you.

I really wanna say its amazing how you've not only turned yourself around, but have given so much back to those of us still afflicted. Your an inspiration; i hope to give back myself when i get clean (and i will one day)Understood... I was totally kidding if that didn't come through on my previous comment �Same mamaYou are so welcome dear. You really truly deserve it. You do so many amazing things for other people. I always find it hard to describe how I truly feel when I am overly passionate about something and I am very passionate about how I feel about your work.
Whew.... I wish that was the case for me. My mom bought it off amazon and mailed it in but nonetheless. Great read. I love your view on people staying off dope via suboxone. It really hit home and I couldn't agree more. Thanks for everything Tracey!See, that’s all I was asking, thank you. I hope I didn’t come off as rude, as everyone else took it. 
>I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week 

Wow only 5 days a week? Are the junkies in s.f taking weekends off now? Very progressive! 

/s orry couldn't help myself....[deleted][deleted]Oh shit my bad I’m sorry Sometimes it actually corrects someone who misspelled it... But for real. Why do we have a bot for a misspelling or a typo?They don’t even let me in the room :( I was just worn out and planning to die so it was easy to try new things 3-4 years the cravings died off for me Hey, good job!! Don’t know if you still need but the best way to go is naturally and just get some type of craft. Or try smoking CBD it really saved me when I was going insane with coke Mine too strangely enough I’m glad Harm Reduction is widely available there Thanks. I think I found it. Sure. Congrats :) I only took 1/2 and I’ve nevef been fucked up like that �������Google my blog “black tar heroin:10 questions answered”. No cell phones- just pagers. And the dope wasn’t as strong Congrats to you Wow how does it feel Allegedly I was high when I made it Oh no I love compliments- no sarcasm there. After you get to be 40, the validation dries up �You can give back now. Don’t let drug use stand in the way of your dreams. There are plenty of ways we can all contribute ���Tracey's a staple of this sub. If you havent already, watch that old HBO doc called Black Tar heroin, its in SF in I think the late 90s if you wanna see where she's coming from. Like in a very intimate way, almost to the point that I feel weird recommending it. But I think it's many of our favorite doc about junkie living.She had saved so many lives here by sending Narcan. Truly a blessing she is here. I once sent her a message in a dark time, I believe I asked something along the lines is recovery truly possible? She sent back something inspiring! I’m almost 2 years clean now. Life is lovely. I still hang around to remember how things used to be and sometimes chime in with info. I’m sorry you got downvoted so much. I don’t leave the house on the weekends- depression naps...I've been clean for like 4 years or so ( besides taking something like once or twice a year) and I just like looking sometimes.

Or maybe there is people in comment sections or posts that are looking for advice or help and she is trying to help in any way she can given her experiencesI get what you are saying. I used to come for the company, but ultimately it is what forced me to take a good look at myself. I come back to see how everyone is doing, and remind myself why I quit. Because being in active addiction is not a requirement for participating here. Anyone with honest curiosity, recovering addicts, relatives of someone in the struggle is welcome. We share our experiences, our victories and defeats, our happy moments, and our grief.There are a lot (A LOT) of people here who either don't use anymore or never have. I think the downvotes are just because that's common knowledge here. Even though, you have done so much!I bet....keep up the good fight. You have saved so many lives....including this one. You are an inspiration and the reason I found Reddit and this sub. That’s funny congrats! Do you have an interview or AMA talking about your experience with those times and the film? I feel like I heard about something like that. tha k u tracey . any complications from iv dope by the wayLol thanks. 90 days is pretty pathetic compared w the 13 YEARS I had, but I'm trying not to beat myself up. My midlife crisis kinda knocked me for a loop...[deleted][deleted]I'm old enough in this sub when i remember her showing up. We shot the shit in the old IRC back when i was active and living in boston all strung out. Sent her collarbone pics hah. She's a saint of the damned and has touched so many fucking lives. She knows more about my shit than most friends and all my family.There’s a few on Reddit somewhere She has a blogyou didnt answer the questions about the others status but thats okay. have a good 1 traceyI’ve had 34 abscesses and I had Hepc but im cured now My mid life crisis involved crippling depression Absolutely. My crotch was on fire the first few months I’ve only gotten better with age Was it because back then you didnt know the dangers of reusing dirty needles and not wiping alcohol and overall just goos hygeine when shooting (for the abcesses) and for the hep C was that because everyone was unaware that sharing needles passed on hep c and other diseases? thank you for answering allcmy questions. sorry im so curious ofnwhat it was like to live back then bring a junkie like myselfNo one knew about Hep C then. It wasn’t even called hep C. It was non A non B crazy did you guys know about endo and blood infections. you guys probaly necwr wiped with alcohol and practice safr injection. u guys were savagesWe did but the main thing we were worried about was HIV because there were no meds at the time  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: lol, Content: , ups: 1262, downs: 0Hmm surely they wouldn't cut my £0.30 Xanax pills with a dangerous drug...[deleted]Not the worst meme OP. Plot twist, Xans weren't laced, still died due to mixing Opi's and Benzo'sLmao will that really save u if the nanny is cut with fentyHahahahahahahahahahahaaaaummmm.....of course....xan + sub = full respiratory depression...Bupe can't block fent.  lolLol this should be on r/drugscirclejerkfuuuckAfter my last surgery they had to give me fent where I’d been on sub but I could be wrong Accept there is something called binding affinity and compounds with a higher binding affinity can dislodge others. Sub has a higher binding affinity than naloxone so it dislodges it making it useless. Fentanyl, has one of the highest binding affinities of any opioid and dislodges bupe and naloxone. To a degree an extreme amount of naloxone can offset this but in reality if there is any significant dose of fentanyl present you will need a compound called methylnaltrexone...

Psst and you dumbasses think you’re a scientist? 

Btw the term would be pharmacologist 

Either way you’re not it It's a sad fuckin' situation that people have to worry about black-market benzo's are cut with fent!!!  Sad but true.This had me rolling ����Wish i could get subs, but if i went to a doc for it my neuro would for sure cut my script for epilepsy and then the fuck if id be able to drive. And after that is one buttery ass slippery slope.If it’s strong enough, it’ll overpower the buprenorphine. Be careful with fentanyl. Perfect pic to go wit itI remember when I got off fentanyl/fent analogue I had to take 16 mg of subs to relieve the dope sickness and even then, I was just functionable, not high. However, more recently I got off BTH and I took 4mg of suboxone and definitely was a bit high, was a pleasant suprise. Now I am taking 1-2mg a day and while I don't get a traditional "opiate high" i get a definite mood boast and energetic which I enjoy. Never saw black market benzos, they are otc here...do even xans get cut with fent these days? that a thing?Is this why I’m seeing a decrease in demand for xannies on the street? People are really worried about product being cut with fent. Or is the hype surrounding Lil Xan blowing it out of proportion?The accuracy �Back to formulaBupe can help reverse an opiate overdose, but bupe in your system or not, if 5mg of fent Could kill you, and you ingest 5mg of fent, you're out for the count. You're still adding opiates on top of opiatesXanax pills cut? Isn't that like the benefit of pills, it's sort of easy to tell if it's been fucked with? Are these people crushing the bills, cutting shit in, and then repressing them? Wtf?

Man people downvote you hard for not knowing Xanax facts[deleted]Yes especially since the science doesn’t make perfect sense. Like ya there’s less per receptor activity, and less overall, but if there’s nothin in the xan...you’ve just taken opis for no reason. Subs are opis obviously even if they’re weak. If they want an antagonist, go get naloxone there’s a plethora. 

That’d be more “pure” for this purpose. 
And more effective. Tho bupe does have higher binding affinity than fent so thatd help a bit but I don’t think that the person who made the meme considered all variables and neuro pharmacological effects. 
So much on here is like, really da!!!!Sadly the only comment that mention the dangers of mixing Xanax and bupe.“the nanny” lol It can't? Really? Link, please.  Not challenging you. Just curious.  Thanks.??? It can. It has a higher binding affinity. It won’t block entirely but it would help. The only issue is few molecules of drug need to bind for a high level of affect in fents case. But it would help. Naloxone would be more effective but also bupe has higher binding affinity than fent while naloxone has equivalent binding affinity roughly speaking. 

- have actually used bupe to reverse a fent overdose more than once but I theoretically knew it would work or I wouldn’t have tried it... on myself first back in the day, then others. 

when I first learned about this in neuroscience and pharmacology classes I thought it might work but it took me a few years to prove because people don’t overdose in front of me all that often, from fent specifically. Got my chance tho. I always thought this info should be dispersed as harm reduction . I believe fent is 1 of 3 drugs w a higher binding affinity to the mu receptor....oxymorphone being anotherYes it can..Yeah it unfortunately has become a thing and a legitimate concern when sourcing black market pharmaceutical benzos. It is crazy but yes  people are insanely pressing whats marketed aa 2mg   xanax bars that in actuality contain fent not if you have enough narcan. i od'd on 3 mg of fentanyl hcl and was not on suboxone at the time, with pressed roxy pills and needed 2 doses of narcan nasal to life.A large percentage of street Xanax is pressed even if fent isn't in it, a plethora of other things could be. My friend died from coke cut with fent


I thought like u thinking before that. Now I just have a head scratcher 

They shouldn’t be but I guess some people are fucking stupid Lil Peep died from a fent pressed Xan. It makes sense, the bupe blocks the fent.


I would've died every time I was banging straight fent if it weren't for all the bupe still in my system.They aren’t really weak, they just aren’t as euphoric. An 8mg sub would floor someone who doesn’t ever take opiates, IMO. They’d be having a bad time. 

But also fent will push through subs, so this meme doesn’t make sense. Why would a Xanax have fentanyl in it?[deleted]That's what Casey Anthony referred to Xanax as. Xanny the Nanny. Gave that shit to her kid so she could party instead of parent.I think he meant that fent will almost always break thru the bupeYeah I’ve never used bup to treat OD. But I have used suboxone (1-3mg) in the morning then went and got high. I did the same amount of not more than my friend who had a large habit (gram-ish/day). He OD’d and I didn’t. I got plenty high but was completely fine and not close to OD. My boy ended up ODing and needed 6mg of narc to comeback. After his urine test he found out the dope was mainly fent. At the time I had no dope habit at all just was on 1-3mg of sub a day.

I know it’s a different situation but still feel like this example holds some value to the topic. I’ve also heard similar stories of bup reversing OD from heroin (probably fent mixed). I wouldn’t recommend using suboxone to reverse an OD unless it’s life or death situation with no narcan or medical assistance available. What were you taking a pharmacology class for. I also got a degree in neuroscience but never needed to take pharmacology. It might of been an elective tho. Are you sure? I'm convinced that taking bupe after fent can reverse an OD/cause precipitated withdrawalsYeah. Dilaudid is one of the few opioids besides fent that binds more strongly than bupe. 

I was looking for a good source to provide for people but it was surprisingly hard to find.Look it up. Google or something.Weird. It's been a while but I only ever got bars and I feel like I'd know the difference. Shit I remember another reddit user said he got his bars he bought tested and they had some wack cannabinoid in them. You never know nowadays Wow I wonder why they would even cut coke with fent. Was it an accident? Was it like a laboratory making both chems and one got mixed in, a careless dealer moving both? More likely part B.

I’m unmoved personally. I think all drugs should be legal and take Xanax for diagnosed anxiety. If people are buying bars on the street uninformed as fuck, it’s their own fault when they get a bunch of crappy fake BS. When I buy on the street i know the risk and accept responsibility for any consequences I might endure as a result of my bad, fun choice. I have a friend who is now dead because he took three bars laced with fentanyl. Motherfucker was 24 years old. He was behaving like an idiot and lost his life. It makes me sad as fuck.

You guys got my comment all wrong. Playing with something that might have fent in it is like dicking around with a loaded gun, eventually something bad is going to happen. The idea that you’d be taking suboxone to counteract the effects of what might be in your fake pills is fucking stupid. I am not saying it doesn’t suck when these people die, it’s a god damn tragedy. If we quit the war on drugs and legalized narcotics this wouldn’t be a problem. But they are stupid. Anyone behaving like this is behaving like a fucking stupid idiot and is rolling dice with their life on the crap table. Street drugs are Russian Roulette these days. 

I mean I know the meme was just for fun but it’s kind of a morbid topic for anyone whose life has been touched with death as a result of the specter of fentanyl. It’s today’s mystery monster that pops up everywhere randomly killing innocent stoners. All I can think is, why? And the only answer I can come to is that drugs are illegal. Would solve so many problems it’s literally mind boggling.Nooe, he had alprazolam and fent and pxy in his system so a fake oxy 30 with fent is like 1000% more likelyI remember reading somewhere that one of his friends (I think mackned) had an oxy 30 that looked fake but gave it to peep instead of taking it. The bars were most likely real, the 30 was probably pressed I lied my first time in rehab  and said I was an opiate addict even tho I wasn't dependent and had no tolerance. 4 mg of bupe twice a day for the first 3 days combined with phenobarbital for benzo w/d had me so high that I blacked out the whole weekend 

The nurses had to keep checking on me because I was perpetually nodding. Definitely wasn't having a bad time lolPer receptor site relative to street drugs in terms of activity they are weak. Dose is relevant. But yeah I mean depolarization  requires more receptors filled per neuron  ... bupe on its own is even weaker ... it’s metabolite norbuprenorphine is more active but it’s conversion rate is low and has a ceiling effect so 

to simplify; weak, yes

That doesn’t mean people don’t get high af. People get high off codeine ffs. And I know it’s morph that’s active in that case but again ; ceiling effect due to conversion necessity Fake 


Pressed pill made in black market 

Some are so accurate they’re impossible to differentiate I know. Isn't fentanyl more expensive? I remember on the DNMs you could get massive bags of real alprazolam or whatever it is and/or pressed pills. I always assumed it was much easier and cheaper to make and/or smuggle that shit.

I know fentanyl is pretty cheap esp. given its potency, but honestly it just seems stupid to me. I guess it's just to meet a demand when you have no supply but killing mofos isn't good for business either.

Like when someone cuts fentanyl into coke. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE SAME HIGH?!? So why not just give people 100% baby laxative if you're fucking them over anyways? It'll take you 30 seconds to realize it isn't coke. Why risk the manslaughter charge?I agree, I’m annoying. I wouldn’t want people to think it actually works like that, and I guess I just am at a point of exasperation with internet pharmacy advice. 

Bwahahahaha. Best random fact I've heard all week.Lol, never knew that. She lives in just a bit south of me. She is always front and center for Trump protests here in Palm Beach.Not true. Buprenorphine has the highest affinity of any opioid around. If you take a full blocking dose of 24 mg nothing will break through. That’s exactly what I meant thank you for specifying I should have done but it slipped my mind:
When no other means of reversal is around, subs will suffice especially in pt’s that are not opiate naive. Subutex works too but suboxone is preferable due to antagonist component. 


it makes perfect sense that this works the way it does in your story. Theoretically, bupe occupied receptors protecting them from Fent binding, 

even though bupe, and metabolite norbuprenorphine especially, is  active....bupe contributes less per occupied receptor site to opening of ion channels, thus changing the voltage of the cell less, thus causing less overall depolarization/firing of the neuron, 

Also since bupe has a higher binding affinity (level of “attraction” to receptor... think of it like the strength of a magnet for simplicity) than fent it takes priority at the receptor site and prevents the more powerful molecules from occupying as many sites as they would’ve (like in your ODd friend)

Your friend took so many mg of naloxone to bring back because 1- fent only needs a few receptor bound for a potent effect thus lots of antagonist needed to bounce the few off 2- naloxone actually has a pretty similar binding affinity to fent. Bupe actually has a higher affinity which is why it can work better than naloxone in for fent. 3- dose is relevant but not the only factor clearly 


 ... as I said, per occupied receptor site compared to commonly abused drugs (even more disparity with fentanyl) 

Anyway I studied neuroscience and psych and was a junkie for ten years so this =my shit. I used to love combining 7yr worth of study at university with my life experience from my habit because I’d come up with life saving info like this without having tried it out in the field. It saved my life first, so I’d say it was pretty damn helpful. That guy I ODd in front of, if I hadn’t told him what to do, woulda dragged me into the street by the ankles otherwise. Dealers don’t want dead chicks in their house. Bupe has a higher binding affinity than diamorphine, so it can be used as to reverse a H OD, but I think naloxone is still better to use as it's a true antagonistSo, fent, oxymorphone, And hydromorphone Bars are what's being pressed. It just depends on the presser and how professional they are. A lot of presses are shitty and you can tell something's off, it's crumbly, chalky, tastes weird, breaks easy, etc, indicating that it's been pressed. Where as some more professional pressers with better pill presses can make some practically flawless presses that you really can't tell they're pressed at all without sending to energy control or something and seeing a higher dose than 2. I can only imagine they put fent into super stepped on coke or to cause an opiate wd and get them always coming back for moreWell he always had oxy in his system though, and he was taking bars in the video he uploaded the night he died, plus pretty sure they confirmed it was the bars?^^Either way I really wish he was still here.Isn't it already dangerous as hell to mix the two to begin with? Not saying it's not possible but if he got high quality presses its hard to OD on those alone. I've taken probably hundreds and never once OD'dWell I’ve seen people who are opiate naive take 8mg of bupe and throw up for two days, so that’s what I mean by having a bad time. it could be as simple as someone weighing out alprazolam and fent on the same scale without cleaning it, incidental cross-contamination.Didn’t find it annoyingBut your explanation was wrong because your scenario you laid out was wrong.


The situation is a pressed bar which definitely has some benzo in it, most likely 2-4 mg of alprazolam, but possibly cut with fentanyl.

Taking bupe prior to using fent truly DOES reduce risk of overdose, while still allowing the benzos to do their work.


I know how bupe and fent works, it's all I did for months and months.[deleted]Lol I heard it on Last Podcast on the LeftRegular fentanyl has a binding affinity to the u-opioid receptors of 0.39nM, bupe has a range of 0.21nM to 1.5nM. Fent can still bind even with suboxone in the system. Not even mentioning the fent analogues like 3-Methylfentanyl or carfentanil that can easily stay bound to receptors even with large doses of naloxone. Reply to your comment with Not True LOL. Fentanyl will break through with the right dose and it doesnt have to be ridiculously high eitherTell that to the me from 2 years ago who was breaking through his subs with fent-dope literally every other day lolYeah I don't think anybody I deal with is that sophisticated, although I suppose the guy above them could be. Never confirmed, and its enough that one of the oxies he takes is fake and hes gone. Its very ignorant to say the bars had the fentanyl, when clearly he was taking bars that contain real alp aswell. The most likely culprit has to be the oxy in that situationAs long as its all pharms and you know your limits, mixing benzos with opie is ay okay. I have mixed benzps, opies, gabapentin, ghb and alcohol recently on a night out and was fine because i know my tolerance and limits50/50 I guessMakes kinda sense though I don’t know what they say. Not if the buprenorphine is at a full blocking dose. The other guy posted affinity numbers but the only place I could find them was on Wikipedia, no academic sources. I was told by someone who works in the field that nothing can break through buprenorphine except for uncommon opioids like lofentanil and 3methylfentanyl as the guy said. Those are not really around at all save 3methyl in some eastern European countries. Estonia I believe. I feel like most Xanax is pressed now. I used to get a thousand bars at a time that were almost identical to pharma. I almost never come across real bars there more expensive and weaker than presses It’s everywhere.

I know because I've done it with fentanyl, as have other people on the internet.Nigga, i was prescribed 43.7mg (4 of the highest formulation Zubsolv)  of sub a DAY ... out of 155 patients i had the 3rd highest dose prescribed, and the top dude died after 3months so i graduated to the 2nd highest prescribed patient on a dose of suboxone in illinois... (so my doctor said, anyway.. i find that hard to believe personally, but then again 44mgs is retardedly unheard of and unnecessary) 

And guess what?
I still blasted right thru that shit with good ol’ street dergz ��Doesnt mean it is waaaaaayyyy mire likeky to be the fake oxy. If fent bars were really that big of a thing opioid addicts like me would fucking search for them for the sake of the fent. Atleast i would :DHaven’t heard that one either. Oh well. It’s just common sense that self reflection awareness and acceptance =beneficial I'm willing to bet you weren't on 24+mg of buprenorphine. At that level all the receptors are saturated and it's not possible. Until I see real evidence to the contrary I'm not going to change my belief on that. If you have anything academic that confirms what you're saying it would be interesting to me. I call bullshit. The ceiling dose is reached before 32 mg. No doctor who had any idea what he was doing would prescribe that much. But honestly, I really don't care. It's only impossible in theory, in practice you might not be absorbing as much bupe or your metabolism gets rid of the one and makes the other come out idk. In real life there's way more factors than a in vitro test. But technically you shouldn't be able to break through on a ceiling dose of bupe. I mean it’s usually a really small amount of Fent in them not enough to be economical for serious junkies but enough to fuck someone up who looking for xans, and if he was used to oxy, cuz I never heard him doing h, and he took a bunch of them like in the video, it could totally kill him. But yes fent is much much more common in presses opi pills.I think u/DonRobeo is going for the phrase "The first step towards getting better is admitting you actually have a problem."

I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it but for some reason I can't remember the exact wording either.was on 24 mg for 4 months. dont believe it if you want and i dont feel like looking up any studies if there are any im just telling you my experience. respect your opinion still though. chemicals compete for the receptors and the dose combined with the affinity the drug has for the receptor chooses which wins.I'm not sure one way or the other which of you is right - on the one hand, 24mg is a huge dose and it's easily believable that not even fent can break through it, but on the other hand people's responses and metabolism and biology are all different, and I've personally experienced breaking through 8mg just with heroin and not even with a large amount. Sure, I didn't get the full effects of the H, but I definitely have managed to get high a few hours after taking 8mg of subs, so I could also believe that with enough fent you could break through any dose of subs.

So I'm not sure who's right, but I just wanted to point out that it's not fair that you are holding /u/1inchslanger to a higher standard of proof then you are yourself providing for your argument. You are telling him that he has to link to and cite academic sources for his claim whilst your sources for your argument is "someone who works in the field". Dr. P******n, Champaigne, il - was narrowly defeated by like 50 votes when he ran for mayor (dudes got juice) - hes got an original bottle of OTC heroin from 1911 chillin in his office... he  also knew my uncle on a personal basis and told me i was one of the worst, most unique cases of addiction he’s seen in 15+ yrs of addiction practice - he was also the first dr in illinois to prescribe suboxone. And one of the first to prescribe methadone in a Maintenance capacity.

If you think im one of these little fuckin kids who thinks addiction is cool that goes around lying about shit to sound cool on this thread? Then I shouldn’t even be wasting my breath on you ; you’re of your depth, homeboy.

I try to remain humble, but i am the LAST person who would ever lie about my drug experiences - i have way too much respect for the chemical and the world that we all fell into to spread bullshit.

He used to basicaly admit to me that he had no intention of ever getting people off subs - there were people that had been coming for 7years that had never even gone down on a dose.

If you dont believe me, thats on you brother.And i hate to break it to you? But the majority addiction specialists don’t have the first clue as to what the fuck they do/prescribe.

I feel like he lowkey knew that i was hoarding these fuckin things - i would skip every other appt. basically letting him know “i dont nees subs this week, i’ll be back when its convenient for me”

I ws getting prescribed two BOXES of the generic every time i picked up my shit from the pharmacyUmm if there is enoguh fent in fake bars to get a noticeable effect even for non opi users there is CERTAINLY enough in it to make it economical for junkies. Trust me, atleast where i live in it would be much cheaper then buyng oxys etc and heroin is non existent here, if fent bars were commonly a thing every fucking junkie would be doing em here. Source: am a junkieits all subjective like you said everyone has a different experience. it could be that i need a higher dose to completely saturate my receptors. it could be that fentanyl is unique as an opioid (it is) and simply has strong enough affinity to displace buprenorphine depending on the dose. 

im currently tapering off and i was put under just recently with fentanyl and propofol to have my wisdom teeth removed, at a dose of 4 mg twice a week  skipping all the days inbetween but that proves nothing. i wish i was on 24 at the time of the surgery so i could have set in stone proof fentanyl can do such a thing at 24+ mgI wouldn't tell people the name of a doctor you've been to, that makes it very easy to identify you and can cause trouble for that doctor. Anyway, I believe you but I don't know why any doctor would ever do that, it's commonly accepted that past 32 mg all receptors are filled and any more bupe is just pissing out money. Read any prescribing guideline. Some docs still do it because they get money from the pharmaceutical company to bill the insuranceIt’s almost like addiction is a disease that they can only help you so much with� but yes let’s blame those idiot doctors because you made foolish decisions in your life which led to you being an addict. Fuck those doctors and opioid specialists amirite @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Ran into my old dealer yesterday, Content: This dude would front and front and front and front me, I'd always pay. He had good H and things went like this for a while until he ran out at some point.  This is five years and some months ago now, he hit me up, I'm dope sick as can be and he says, "want to go for a ride (to base)?  Hook it up". Yes!
He scoops me up, we drive the 40 minutes or so away and get to dude's house, he's got the H drawn up. I've never done it or seen it like that before  but I'm sick so tell him to hit me.
Literally I remember telling him I am totally fine, I want one more shot before we go and that's the last memory I have before waking up in the hospital.
Where we were is an old abandoned town where an airport use to be, literally just drug dealers live out there now and a good 30 minutes from a hospital. Dude could have just left me out there, thrown me down some abandoned street.
He took me to the hospital and when I woke up he was still there, he brought me home.
Well, five years later now I'm at a gas station with my almost two year old and I run into him. He has a two and a half year old, he's sober too, just bought a house. It's a really good feeling that we both made it but I'm telling you, dude has always been good to me and I'll never know why but it was kick ass to see him again!  Felt like it deserved a post, it's a pretty significant moment to me.
That's all guys 👌, ups: 1213, downs: 0Well this is just an all around, feel good story with a sense of warmth that has no business on this subreddit. You can either delete this post or quickly edit in you smoked H in his car in front of your kids and then stole his iPhone, at the vert least. Your choice.

seriously though good work, my ex-coke dealer just got out of jail and I avoid him like the fucking plagueHell yeah brother I have an oxy dealer that is exactly like that. He would front me hundreds of them because he knew I would pay up. Really cool fucking guy he is. Sadly he went away and I havent seen him in a few months. Once you build trust and buy alot really good dealers treat you pretty much like family. He would always call me his brother haha.Is your dealer the real life Junkie Jesus?and people say no good comes from h... We are all people. Thanks for writing this. A lot of people here need to see it. YEAH WELL MY DEALER WONT EVEN ANSWER HIS PHONE...  SO YEA.

Some guys get all the fuckin luck.[deleted]Great story! Thanks for brightening my day OPI’m gonna assume you’re a woman. If you were a dude he would pushed you out and said fuck off.lol this is heartwarming shitThat's as wholesome as r/opis can get! Thanks for sharing, this made me genuinely smile and hopeful that I'll cruise around with some future kids, too, sometime in the future. Nice dude! Maybe keep in touch with him if he has his affairs in order![deleted]Honestly thought it was gonna be a story about you getting jumped by your old dealer but no, it’s this beautiful fucking wholesome story. It makes me feel warm just reading it <3I love this story.It’s great to hear there are good people in the world especially when people think drug addicts are bad people That’s pretty badass !![deleted]❤️!! Lots of positivity your way Good story.  Surprisingly good ending for a story on this sub.  But sometimes I think people look at their time of addiction as a bad time.  Although it wasn't always a good thing, I look at it as a great learning experience.  I don't miss the wds, but I miss some of the enjoyable times I had during that period of my life.  Glad to hear yours had a good ending too, for you as well as him.So sweet LOL totally get it. I did overdose, get Narcan'd in the hospital, woke up so pissed off and stupid I ripped my IV's out of both of my arms and left the hospital though. So there's that.  Dealer went to jail for about a year for some meth bullshit and that was the last I heard of him until yesterday. I always use to jam my Korn CD when I'd run to his place and every time I hear those Korn songs I think about those times. My nostalgia lol.  Story still belongs here man, I relate to posts here"Avoid him like the fucking plague" You mean pick him up from jail hoping he'll knock some off you price for a 8 ball?You a funny guy Are we so depraved and absolutely devoid of feel\-goods?

I mean, I know I am...Feels like family too when you're living the life, heySomething to think about! Shit it might be him, he’s risen again after leaving the tomb from the opium farms in China. Piss on them hey. I am who I am because of my past with hThe first buddy I lost to drugs overdosed and was thrown out of the vehicle, had a stroke in a snowbank, life support for a few days and it took him out.  We are all people, true, but that could have easily been my story. Lots of thanks to my dealer���� lolOh I agree with you about straight edgers being fake. Some of the most shallow relationships I've ever experienced. I'm one year off of Subutex too, good job man and keep it up!   My active addiction I've felt things, (feelings, highs) stronger and more intense than I'll ever feel them again, it's a very important part of my life, good and bad. Love this subThanks man, thanks for reading!Yup Yup, right away. We caught up a little but, for five, ten minutes in line at the slowest gas station around.  Was real niceExactly what I've always thought. I've always thought well of him. The type of person you wish you would see again, in a better place in life. And thanks man, me too. So glad. I had a buddy who overdosed and his "friends" didn't want to get in any shit so they threw him out of the vehicle NEAR the hospital. He had a stroke outside in a snow bank and was on life support for a couple days, ultimately he didn't make it.  They were shooting speed freak and Suboxone, dirty drugs but that could have easily been me, thrown out of the vehicle.  Shit makes you wonder a lot and is why I proudly own where I've been in life. Lots of thanks owed to my old dealer though for sureThank you!  Same to you!I miss some of it too, a lot of it and definitely feel the same, it was a huge learning experience.  I remember one summer when I was living alone and it was beautiful outside and all I could do was shower and lay on the floor and feel bad that I couldn't bring my dog swimming or outside at all. I could hear the fireworks going off on the 4th of July, my family would come over to check on me and I was just a mess. That was the worst summer of my life, total waste and miserable.  Sends chills down my back. Addiction is such an intense thing. I'm glad your story had a good outcome too, my friend. Makes you appreciate a happy, peaceful life >hear those Korn songs

Only the albums up until Issues, I hope Yess Korn rocksWhat do you mean I'm a funny guy? Like I'm a clown? I'm here to amuse you? It really does and he really treated me like family and no matter how much I owed he always gave me more and never ever let me go to work sick or  be sick ever. He always delivered to me no matter where or what time it was too. One of the few good dealers around.I volunteer at a needle exchange, and used an overdose kit on a woman turning blue in our parking lot. It was my first time having to do that (opiates aren't my personal demons, but loved ones struggle) and it was terrifying. She was so mad at me! I know why, but getting yelled at sucks and I was already nervous and scared. 

Now anytime I see anyone being too still in their car in parking lots I check on them. Most of the time it is just tired employees, but I always think about that woman. Yes I agree. What I was getting at more was we are all people as in we all have the capacity to care and all the like, negative and positive.  I'm glad you are still here and able to share these stories with the community. :) now watch yiu r children have school together.  Haha you could both arrange the Halloween party and share old tales of runs past. 
That's real fucked up man.  There is no reason to do this.  I mean I understand you can catch a charge still in some states but I'd like to think I'd take that to save a life.For sure!   Really not into the Skrillex Korn stuff. Really like Brian Welch and listened to some of his other stuff, it's not bad at allEach Korn album (up to and including Issues) is amazingFinally. You got it. Username checks out....hey tommy!My last oxy dealer WAS my family and they fucked me out $250. Fuck you uncle tom and your lying ass daughter, though I am clean now thanks to that whole fiasco.my bf goes to work with me sometimes, especially if we don't round up money to score til last minute and he'll just chill in the car. i had to make him start parking in the back of the lot because people forever thought he was overdosed when he fell asleep (i work nights so he is often sleeping). irritating at times, but i'm glad so many people care enough to say something. God bless you for being there!Thanks man!   Lol about the kids, our luck they'll date!  Catch a charge for what?But that's when they were mainstream, so you're not very cool if you had no idea they existed before that.Well you lost $250 but you found out your uncle and cousin were scumbags and got clean! Not too bad of a trade off, at least in my eyes. Congrats dude!Wow thats fucked up.Taking an OD'd person to a hospital/authorities, I thinkI was like 10 years old when I got their self/titled album. made my parents buy it for meBack in my day, a guy stiffed me for a bill, and I was all angry, stomping around. My roommate said, "Look, you learned the content and quality of his character, and it only cost you $100. That's cheap." I had to pause, and admit he was right..
Anything with a parental warning label on it was a strict no-no in our household. Right up until I got to high school when I built a computer so I could get free music (dialup) and play counter strike 1.1 or 1.3, whichever the last version that allowed bunnyhopping. i saw them live a few times, first time i was in grade 6. that was a year after columbineI think 1.3 was the patch that took out bhopping. Ahh the good old days. Almost brings a tear to my eye.Or totem up and camp a corner.

Get someone high enough to glitch the map @@@@@@@@@@ Title: #NormalPeopleMatter, Content: , ups: 1182, downs: 0Heroin matters let’s make it legal twitter saves the world againthe accuracy100% agree with this but some of the other shit I’ve seen pisses me off too. I saw some 13yr old little fucked saying she should be “thrown in jail cause she’s a drug user And he doesn’t like it when people use drugs, people can find other ways to deal with problems” OH OK thanks for solving addiction before leaving middle school, why did no one else think of that! 

Also saw some news site bullshit talking about how her family tried to intervene a few weeks ago but it didn’t work (obv), and then basically say she overdosed for attention seeking....  like oh she’s famous and couldn’t possibly have the same issues as ALL OTHER ADDICTS, it must be an attention grab. Most addicts relapse after years sober just to get attention. 

The shitty trend of just wanting views/ likes/ whatever, not caring about truth or integrity, idk man it’s pathetic. And just knowing what it is to be an addict and like how shitty it would be to have people publishing and telling 10’s of thousands of people that you relapsed for attention like damn that is gunna help her for sure. Change takes a while. We butchered Britney in 2007 during her crisis - slowly things are changing imoYup...and they say addicts are the mental ones. Just stop listening to the bullshit and think logically for yourself. Yes, society is and always will be a confused bitch - much like your holy roller mother in law (who did every drug known to mankind back before she lost her memory about it all, has the same wild 80's hairdo with really damaged, bleached hair and can't shut up about everything you do and be gossiped about and belittled by a freaking crazy ass bitch that thinks ppl like "the Long island medium" are the most intelligent and that it could be true about the world being flat. Yup, "society" is a freakin bitch, my friends.I would think that such a high up celebrity OD would raise awareness and break down some of the stigma when dealing with it. demi did heroin fr?Too true SAVE DIACYTLMORPHINE!!! What I don't get is why people have to make this comparison. Most people don't hear about every normal person that overdoses because they're not public figures. The reason people care about this is because this is someone who has been very public about their struggle with sobriety. If anything this is baby steps towards the general public changing their opinions towards all drug addicts. 

Wish we could all just wish her well and a safe recovery instead of comparing her to other people. I saw something today that said "wish people had this same energy when it came to Whitney Houston". Never even thought about that but it's true. Many People don't care unless it's someone they idolize. 

Regardless, I do hope something good can come out of her od. Maybe it'll open people's eyes to the fact that addiction doesn't discriminate. 

also people bashed peep I feel like I tell exactly this to people daily since she OD'd. People always give me shit for it. It's a dumbass world we live in folks. LolWell I for one haven't contributed much to society. Used up way more taxes than I've paid. Healthcare is free here but it's still something relevant to people in the US If I could upvote this several times I oudl#truthNailed it.It's sad society looks at us, as if we are a waste of life. I saw a thread a few months ago about how opiate addicts shouldn't be allowed to get methadone.  It's just disappointing to hear people say we deserve to feel sick, and if we die "we deserved it"
Like. Our lives don't matter since we are addicted.. �She didnt even OD on H, she OD'd on an opiate but not heroin[removed]#SaveTheHeroinlegalize recreational heroinLmao yeah, what a straw man argument. As if you can lump everyone in the world into one category.“People can find other ways to deal with problems” 

*Drug use drops to 0%* 
Wow thanks kid, you just ended drug addiction bless you Leave Britney alone. that was the biggest scandal of my childhood lmao


but yeah i’ve met a lot of ppl now who are supportive rather than judgmentalAt least Britney had the decency to show her monkey though. I can fuckin relate to this, bro!You mean the same way Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s OD really changed things right?LolIt's just pointing out the double standard people have, if the average person hears about someone loosely attached to their social circle ODing they judge them negatively. If it's a celebrity they show empathy.I think its less of a comparison and more of an awareness to treat the people around us physically better. It's not that most people dont hear about the average person ODing, it's the friends or family or acquaintances that everyday people see pass away and trash their legacy. 


They get on social media and bash the person as a lowlife degenerate and their families read this filth. Yes a good percentage of addicts do bad things to support their habits, but a good percentage of the general population is fueled by greed and corruption to have more money than one can comfortably spend, all in the name of the quest for material things. Addicts, for the most part, do their immoral acts and illicit behaviors due to the pain and suffering of withdrawal. Physically feeling like death and mentally wishing for it. It's a rough fucking life nd yeah we tried drugs in the first place, for a multitude of reasons, but we never wished for this life. We wished for escape from pain, heartbreak, boredom, just the monotony of life.


It's what unites us all. Why are soo many average people bashed as hopeless losers even when we DO know their stories, ambitions, families, the good things they've done for people.. but famous people are immediately glorified and "victims." Yet I very rarely see any just average, normal everyday person projected as a victim. I think that's the question these posts are putting out there. Some have been down right mean and wrong to Demi.. but most are just telling people to be more empathetic to those "real" people that we know, love, or actually spend time with in our lives.


I wish nothing but the best for Demi, and I also do for anyone going through this struggle.I don't think that pointing out the hypocrisy in how the media & general public perceive and treat celebrity addicts vs regular addicts implicitly puts Demi Lovato down. I and I'm sure most of us hope she gets the help & treatment she needs and can relate to her far better than most, and I don't think anyone is pushing for or expects every addict that overdoses to be national news, it's just there is still an ever-present stigma associated with addicts (*especially* heroin addicts) - even the word 'junkie' is synonymous with scum and is spat at people in the same way one might say the word 'rapist' or 'rat' - and this vilification is lacking when it's a celebrity who is falling prey to addiction. 

Nobody is suggesting the solution to this is to not support Demi Lovato or to give every overdosing addict a spot on the evening news, but this provides an opportunity to discuss the opioid epidemic and with any luck Ms Lovato will use this attention and her significant influence to cast light on heroin addiction and keep eroding away the counterproductive & harmful stigma that seems to me to be present in the perception of heroin addicts to a much greater degree than practically any other addiction. 

That's all well and good but people that wouldnt normally not think twice about bashing a junkie actually have been looking up to one for years, that's a pretty big step as being seen as equal and getting help in society.Usually you won’t hear about someone’s overdose unless it kills them.  I think the point was that ALL people struggling with addiction should be wished well, not just celebrities.  And that’s not how it is.  No. Just no. People would say the same thing about a black/Asian/Aboriginal person as long as they were a celebrity. It’s called famous privilege. Please don’t be so quick to yell white privilege, especially if it straight up is not valid. Oh godNo. If this were Oprah people would be shocked to hear she had an issue (they’d allow her addiction to be categorized as a disease), and they’d be clicking likes and hearts to show their support, and sending out thoughts and prayers via social media. People would still want to see her be and do well. It’s because she’s famous. 

But your regular ass folk, be they white, Black, Asian, whatever...if you have a problem, you’re scum and stop giving fucking narcan and wasting money on them, let em die with the addiction they chose; it’s not a disease. 

Please don’t with that shit, ok? >straw man

Lots of people actually think that way, it's hardly something that Twitter user just came up with on the spot.The world is trying to move towards identity politics and it’s failing miserably. It’s one of the reasons Trump won. Ha. She is actually doing great now. In shape, dating a 22 year old, killing it in Vegas. She and Lindsay Lohan got little support. Though Lindsay hasn’t really come up from the bottom. My favorite actor, but he doesn't move the needle for the masses like Demi. Yea he’s not quite in the same demographic.Great post, I agree 100%. You're right in that when this happens to a celebrity, opinions seem to be really contrastingly divided between those who seize the opportunity to kick someone while they're down and vilify them and those who immediately craft the cliche "reckless out of control celebrity spirals downhill" narrative, simultaneously fetishising and glorifying their behaviour by paying so much attention to it whilst overtly appearing to maintain a position of disapproval. 

You also make a fantastic point about another difference between how celebrities vs normal addicts are treated - when celebrities develop a drug problem, it's not uncommon to see magazines, newspapers, talk shows etc to immediately ask why this has happened, try and trace it back to some career misstep or a relationship breakdown or the influence of another celebrity or a childhood trauma etc. In doing so, the media paint a clear picture of a person who is going through a drug problem.

Contrastingly, if a non-famous drug addict is in a position where they receive media attention like if they're related or in a relationship with a celebrity or they're involved or have witnessed a crime etc, they are just written off as a junkie or a drug addict. Whilst the celebrity is a person who is going through a drug problem, the normal addict is just a drug addict/junkie, as if that is their whole identity and they are the embodiment of a drug addict - no need to ask why the person is a drug addict, that would be like asking why a person has blue eyes, that is just who they are. 

This attitude isn't just limited to the media, but I have found it to be the opinion shared by the majority of people, especially those who don't take any illegal drugs themselves. In branding someone a junkie you simultaneously strip them of their humanity and reduce them to their biggest problem and their worst struggle, and it must be difficult for someone to quit when all those around them no longer see past their drug problem at the person behind it all - why quit when everyone sees you as nothing more than a junke anyway? Well said, at least you see why ppl are mad and sad. I just read on tmz that she turned down help weeks ago from ppl around her...i wish some of my dead friends could of had that chance to get clean but they didn't have enough money to get good help. They was lucky if detox took them for 72 hours. And. Then it was oh okay, get out back to the street. Unless you have money for a rehab or halfway house because we have no beds left for youNailed it :)But the opiate epidemic is being treated very differently than the crack epidemic of the 80s that was destroying mostly black neighborhoods. People now care when it’s their suburban children that are getting strung out. I agree with you partly!!! I think it's both and will continue to think it I didn't see people I feel sorry for Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. But instead they made jokes. And look what happen to that family...I stand behind what i said.I agree. But I also think that things are no longer race related more so rich vs poor. Poor whites are looked down on just as much as ghetto blacks. 

The opiate epidemic is truely being treated different than the crack opiate of the 80s. The fact is that this epidemic is effecting people from suburban communities compared to cracks effects on mainly poor urban black. I’m just saying it’d make more sense if they chose a specific person. There’s a lot of compassion for addicts these days, and there’s been a lot of mean spirited Demi memes. There’s assholes and good people in every cross section of society.Hasn’t she? I thought she was laying low in the UAE, opening up spas and shit, and doing well? Fucking bingo. People just look at us with an entirely different mindset. As soon as your junkie secret is out that's it. Unless you're uncomfortably vocal about you're recovery , even if you do get clean its still the same:  untrustworthy, will steal any chance they get, liars, definitely never give cash and always be suspicious of the addict.


Its frustrating talking to so many people: at work, loved ones, etc., and especially those that have never touched anything but some pot, talk so down about addicts. My secret is still hidden but that door is unlocked and opens a little more each month so I still hear their real opinions, shit they wouldnt say to an addict even. Just really makes me so sad to be honest. Why hate an entire group of suffering people- the majority nowadays are good hardworking people that must hide their shame.Exactly, i said the same thing...I've seen it all my life living in the hood Most people who hate junkies would hate all junkies, of every race, equally. Please explain to me how this is white privilege? Bingo. But some ppl will never see it that way, maybe because it didn't happen to ppl they knew.  idk but it's selfish and a shame imoWell her career is over cause its too expensive for Hollywood studios to insure her (you have to get insurance for every big budget film) but to me she seems in a place where she is happy and has a lot of successful business ventures. She also said she used ayahuasca to get permanently sober. Doesnt seem like her "bottom" to me, just a different outcome than she and other people wanted.i haven’t seen her in any movies lately tho

she was in machete that was the last i saw of herI'm not here to explain my mind and things i choose to believe to ,you. Go look up the the past at how junkies were treated, compared to now...it's only like this now because it's white ppl who are strung out the most and not the ghetto population... if it was still majority the ghetto population you wouldn't hear anything about we need to get these people help. You say something like that you should be able to justify it, or least give some reasoning to your opinion. And junkies are starting to get treated better today because addiction has become know as a disease in medical professional rather than a behavioral disorder, however we are still in the transitional phase of this and it while Sounds like your mad at my opinion. Well that's just it, mine, not yours....i really don't understand why you think i need to justify something to you. I'm a grown man who has a backbone so, I'm not gonna just do what you think i should do to please you.  Are you trying to tell me what I'm allowed to think and say??? Please answer me that... Because you don't see me chastising you're thinking, I actually agreed with you on something and some things I didn't. But for the sake of your health you should really stop trying to put words in people's mouths and telling them what they should do and shouldn't do... that's almost the same thing as bullying somebody and people tend to frown upon that. so don't try to bully me little man I think he was just trying to get your reasoning behind your opinion. To better understand and then either have counter points or maybe concede on some things due to being able to understand your POV better. Kinda the point of the subreddit, discussing things with other people. Your deflections don’t really make it seem like your sitting on a whole bunch of good reasons for thinking thatIf you’re a “grown man with a backbone” you should be willing to stand up for your opinion and provide information behind your logic. To just say something and then defend it stubbornly by basically just saying “because I said so” you are acting like a child. I’m not necessarily mad at your opinion, I would just love to try and understand it. Your whole demeanor is so off putting dude; I wasnt getting aggressive with you, maybe frustrated, then you start calling me “little man”, dude you don’t fucking know me, I don’t know you, better not to make personal remarks just stick to the facts provided by the text. As a black man I am aware of white privilege, it just doesn’t apply to this post; like you admitted to another person here, all I asked was that you told me how it applied to this post, if you know it doesn’t; then say so, you fuckin clownI don't have a whole bunch of reasons.  Only a few...shit, i mean I'm a white drug user myself but i still see the white privilege thing happen all day. I could sit here and act like it doesn't happen all day long but it does, I might have been wrong in this situation to use that analogy. but trust me it definitely holds up in the real world...I'm don't mean to come off as bitter but why can't everyone get the same kind of help as everyone else, skin color or status, should not matter......but i already know I'm preaching to the choir here on getting ppl to change how they think about thing's so i won't even try.  But i bet more ppl will still try to change how i think.....i don't get humans Like i said in the previous post, it doesn't have anything to do with it. I even said it was wrong and out of context. But at the same time it's the same people who trash junkies that aren't rich and famous. That embraces the junkies who are famous and or rich...how come we don't ever make a big deal about Wayne oding on lean and having seizures?, but instead we hear about johnny minzal (or how ever you spell it) drinking all the time and needing help with it...look at when Lamar Odom oded and was in a coma for how ever long. The only ppl besides the Kardashians who gave any support & love is bb players and rappers. Why i just don't get it?  Aren't we all human beings who need empathy and love every once and a while?....oh and i don't mean to be off putting, i just have strong feelings toward it and it may come off as assholeish. But I felt you were try to order me in to giving you answers that frankly i don't have to do even if i was in the wrong or not. Because As a grown man i can say and do as i please, as can you, so why does it matter if i did really feel like this is white privilege or not?  I'm allowed to feel like that if i please aren't i ?  there you go talking shit again like i need to justify myself to some internet random or anybody for that matter.    If i was in front of you i would tell you the same thing. You can say I'm being childish and call me a clown all you like pimp, it doesn't bother me like it does you.   Stop thinking ppl owe you something and have to answer a question just because you ask them to.....little boy acting ass grown man go play in the sand box. And kick rocks with your needing an anwser ass...lol Nah b I 100% am with you on the fact that white privilege is way too real and prevalent and disgusting. I don’t think it applies to this comparison from the OP, but I really hope most people would admit that it’s a real thing. It would be incredibly naive to not acknowledge it. Also a kind of commentary about white privilege in and of itself lol 

Like I support you calling it out I try and do the same but I just don’t see it with the post here. And I’m not even saying you should change your opinion and I don’t think the other guy was either I think he just wanted to know why you thought it applied here idk tho can’t speak for them. 

Keep fighting the good fight tho homie Cool  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: No replacement, Content: , ups: 1167, downs: 0See your homeland, swing on the tire swing, look at the stars, roll in the grass, run with your dog, talk with friends (in person) in front of a raging camp fire. drink cheap beer, sing, dance if you like it, Play.

The problem here is that people think life is about having a job, a car, and a roof over your head.  
That's what society tells us, and in some ways that's what actually drives some of us to the drugs.  This tyranny of mundane normality is a façade.Got 2 years clean . I’d nvr be able to do it with out some type of high . Luckily weed has been enough for me so far Right in the feels. Man this sober shit be boring as fuck. I dont know how some people do it for real. Like Idk, ive been forced into getting sober and in the depths of what you would call addiction, tried rehab and everything else. Once I got out of legal trouble and able to have freedom,again I started using drugs again but I keep it way way more low-key and its been fine so far... Like I just need a chemical outlet to not go insanebruh life is boring afLearn to be sober not just with your actions, but in your thoughts too, both conscious and unconscious a like. This will be a daunting task, but after some time your efforts will result in a changed perspective. This will allow you to feel freer from the weight of addiction than you had  ever before dreamt possible. Find a place where you can make yourself uncomfortable yet maintain  your stability. Complacency is a slow cancer that can cause relapse albeit subtly. So, being able to mix things up while still maintaining can seem intimidating, but once you finally master this skill your spiritual and emotional growth will astound you. Proof that growth comes from learning while being uncomfortable. Take control of your mind, don’t allow yourself to be imprisoned by it. Like I said before with time and training, discipline, patience you will eventually learn how to combat those demons in a healthier manner ultimately giving you an overall better quality of life. Remember to keep the long game in the back of your mind for right now and focus on the present. Like the old adage goes, “one day at a time.” Just abstaining isn’t enough, you have to re-wire your brain. 

Edit: some words, thanks for the kind dm’s for anyone out there who is struggling with addiction I too love with that beast constantly crawling up my back so feel free to message me if you need a homie to talk too! I'm not an opioid user but I can relate in the sense that once you feel how great some of these drugs can make you feel, sober life just isn't the same.This is how everyone feels. But almost everyone agrees its better to the alternative. If you ever feel bored think about the reasons you stopped, all the fucked up shit you don't want to see yourself do again.This is literally how I feel everyday. I thought everything would be great once I attained these things, but still just feels shitty1 week sober and I don’t think I’m following the right path �Life isn't enough. I demand euphoriaWhy we must fight our oppressors Yup. 2 months sober and I feel exactly like that lil fish Congrats!!! It feels good doesn't it!!!I have acquired 1.5 of these in the last 15mos. Doing something wrong stillYep I just feel like I wasn't meant to live in this time period. Paleolithic era is where it's at living in nature and shit. Here is the deal, life has to have a purpose and meaning. There has to be an overarching plan or purpose to existing, or is simply base mechanics(eat, work, poop, pee, sleep) with varying distractions. This will become apparent once even hedonism becomes boring, and lol it will eventually.

&#x200B;

This purpose or meaning can be different for everyone, I have a kid I love. Shit I like to get buzzed and take him to the carnival or whatever, I actually like spending time with him.

&#x200B;

If it wasn't for that I'd probably have suicided by now with a big gram shot of fent, I just don't care otherwise.3 mo sober and I'm more lazy now than I ever was on drugsI think the key to the sober life is to have something you love to do.It gets better. You can always drop acid every once in a while lol.pretty close to how i feel, but i still use drugs..Why did you have to post this right before I plan to get clean :/LMAO! 

It’s called being a “dry drunk”. Thanks NA! ��Went 2,5 months sober, ‘relapsed’ a week ago. Had some fun a couple of days and now have to restrain from using some time to not get addicted. 
There is really nothing like Opioids.This is 100% me_irl. I cant get over the anhedonia and depression and then relapse. And for a small time there is color to my world again. And this is why I’m still a heavy poly drug user![deleted]Annnnnddddddd it's gone (south park voice) Sobriety blows I used to be in this boat but i basically feel like i did before using. Still on suboxone tho. Smoking weed really helps. If you're bored while sober, just try pursuing your lifes passion. You dont have to be a parent and wage slave to exist on earth. Do whatever the fuck you want. Well just a thought: how exciting is life on dope? Sure you feel good just sitting there, but you're not earning it. It sucks but I think we need to force ourselves to have fun the normal way.This is it.. Happiness is just molecules in brain Well yeah, I'd feel like shit too if my cubicle had no way to out without climbing over the neighboring ones. 

Nah, I know I'm taking that picture too literally. I get it; I think it's shitty that people who work in call center cubicles work to fund their car and insurance. They'd probably be happier on a lower paying job that was a block away from home if they didn't need the car for much else. A lot of the people I worked with didn't use the car for anything else but commuting to and from work as well as food shopping which is cheap enough to have delivered nowadays.


Some days I feel bleh and don't feel like I can get myself out of that pit, but I usually do. Still, I worry about how I'll feel when I taper off subs. Ok, so I totally do not get being bored in sobriety.

Can you list some stuff that upsets you specifically? 

There is so much stuff to be interested in, it is literally ridiculous. I mean, do you read about these incredible people jumping off mountains in wing suits, and you can actually tell me that life is boring? I want to do that!

Yes, most of us have to work for a living. It is a shame that we cannot play 24/7.  But there it is. Even working 8 hours a day, that still leaves a shitload of time to do fun stuff.

I absolutely do not understand this.  I was a hardcore IV junkie for 11 years, but am clean now. All I have to do to start having fun is literally step outside my front door. Because then I am going to start running into my neighbors and every one of them has a cool story to tell.

The old guys are all about life in the 50s and 60s, which was amazing. The younger guys talk about their sports and their game playing in the corporate world, which if you listen, is shockingly fun. And the girls. OMG the girls. A big smile. Hey what's up? Yeah, I love the neighborhood too. Really, you like (fill in the blank) music? So do I!

And it is off to the races.

The alternative? Well I guess I could hit a big shot of dope and go to sleep. Man, that is just soooo interesting.  Whoops, what do you mean it is 2019? You mean I missed the last five years? Damn, I don't remember them very well. Did I really do that?

Yes, I know, society sucks. Life is not fair. People are stupid. Yada Yada.

I don't think you are trying very hard.

Just my opinion.Add a little weed and therapy and it can get funI feel this man, up until this relapse I was feeling dreadful. I still feel guilty about relapsing, but that's mostly because my family thinks i'm done with the stuff, but that's a fat lie. I've relapsed like 8 times this year. I'm in an internal battle of making my family happy, or making myself happy. And I don't know how much longer I can do the former, I hate myself lately and oxy brings out my confidence and gives me happiness, even if it's artificial. I'll take any happiness I can get at this point.I think it has to do w the way our brains are wired in expectation of instant gratification.  Drugs are excellent choices as vehicles of delivering instant gratification.  When you get clean and are sober, most of the “great” or “exciting” things take TIME to build and develop. Being so used to instant gratification from drugs, the wait for such things to happen to us is “too long”, we get inpatient, and complain that sober living is “boring”.  

[deleted]Doing cardio to exhaustion as much as you can will boost your mood tremendously. Probably the last thing you want to do, but eventually you yearn for that dompamine dump. Better than any drug. Also a quality fish oil supplement in high doses (5 pills/day) will at least make you feel happy. Hope this is helpful. Hahahaha so true. Sigh.Why why why is it like this? How do people like tracey415 get 21 years but I can't even get 3 monthsIs like, you start being addict for some reason, you weren't a asshole, or not that asshole. When stop to taking drugs you have to front this shitty life, problems or feelings which made you take the decision to fucked up.Preach, year and a half sober for the most part. Well if you dont count drinking like a fish every night. Which by the way definitely comes no where close to some dope.Dude I fucking love this comment.This comment is perfection! Started using many different drugs because i can't stand the thought of just living a normal life, just having a prestigeous job, a wife with kids and house to full fill societies thoughts of a "normal" life. In the end, listening and dancing to music makes me truly happy. Sorry for my english it's not my native languageSo if I wander thru the woods alone tonight I’ll feel fulfilled?You got it. But you forgot the part where everything pushes one way where natural contentment and joy is usually another. i like the high i get when i do things like skateboarding, camping, swimming, skiing etc.  Cant stand pot anymore for some reason. Makes me self analyze too much I am sure you have probably thought of this already but is it possible that you are trying to self medicate for what may be underlying depression or anxiety?

I had a very difficult time quitting opiates because I was not being treated for depression. So as if kicking drugs weren't hard enough already,  the only thing I came back to was depression. Being medicated by a doctor for that issue made it much easier to feel okay without being on opiates.I'm in the same boat as you I don't like weed at all sadly, I just use it for sleep. Nothing will ever give me that same happiness as oxyI wish I could be like you. I used to smoke weed everyday and that would be my exit route if I were to stay clean. I want to be completely clean but my lungs went through a lot of damage from a pneumonia I caught where my body went into septic shock and was left for dead. Luckily I was given another chance at life but I keep feeling guilty from my drug use :/  That’s how I thought about it for a long time, but I realized I’d just be nodding off somewhere doing nothing. Sure, I’d feel good but I’d somehow be doing even less than I do sober. Fuckin mind games manI've always thought that the people that can get sober for good, never had much of an issue with drugs in the first place. Find something exciting, go be a smokejumper. Parachute into wildfires for a living... If you are bored I'm sure you hate your job but you can change that and will have to if you want to *really* get better.Your comment hit me right in the feels Dude I related to this so much. Like shit hit the fan and I went to rehab/halfway and worked the whole 12 steps and even sponsored 2 guys. Was sober for a while but now I just smoke weed everyday and pop a pill here and there but shit even when everything is going good it’s just so boring... The key is, switch your drugs, dont just use opiods.

One day you get drunk, then opiods, then lsd, then stims, so on[deleted]Golden advice You must blaze your own path, a job by definition is helping someone else achieve their dreams.Wat..?I was just talking to my mom about this. 
You’re absolutely right that **most** people *need* purpose in their life. For some reason it seems unnatural to not have it and it makes people depressed and hate themselves.
 
For some reason I’ve always flourished and never gotten bored of the hedonistic lifestyle. Doing nothing but what I want and having no drive to mean anything in the world has been just fine with me. 

It’s when I stop living the bum, party and drug fueled lifestyle that I get depressed. Even with purpose, like the many schools I went to, I just wanted to quit and get high instead ��‍♀️Very true, although the addiction recovery programs in my area do not address dual diagnosis.  Some people with mood disorders, for example, detox just sweats you through your DOC.  Then, the PROGRAM in my area is the 12 steps that says no meds at all and essentially genetic mental disorders are a character defect.

Sorry if I am bring up an old thread or replying in the wrong place.  Opiates, alcohol, uppers, whatever, if you are even in treatment for a serious mental disease that will never go away...add life stress....it is Very hard to not want to escape one’s existence.

My bro and I are ravaged by the same disease....I wonder daily if he is gone down the H rabbit hole forever.  I’m no innocent..  we both did programs,  he even delved in 12 step but could not make amends. That step. But that ... anyway thanks for reading.  Typing sober.  Psychedelics don't compare to hard drugs unfortunately plus they can be too anxiety inducing in some people, they aren't for everyone.gotta love NA.   I must be an obese slim guy  ���

Surely these NA guys who are 5+ years clean, spend 4 hours a day in meetings, yet "never think about drugs"  -  are straight up honest people too ���That’s how I hope to use in the future. 

1 month clean, binge for a day or two, then restart. Why are you getting downvoted? Its kinda messed up for drug users, ostracized for finding happiness in something considered "unnacceptable," to be ostracizing you for finding happiness in something they don't like. Kinda hypocritical, if you ask meHigher power as in God and shit like that? ... it’s not about the car ...You gotta get a decent job that you don't hate IMO if you want to stay clean.

No way could I have stuck out my old callcentre job while in WD's or clean, it was just a hateful place. Just like in the spongebob image. My current job on the other hand, I am not forced to get high to make it through a shift;  I ended up getting high after work as it was the long evenings where I got bored and wanted to get high. That's how I ended up getting hooked badly. I remember the first time I used during a work shift, I didn't really like it at first as I thought "damn people might notice"   (but in the past 5 or so years my tolerance was so high I appear completely 100% normal)Exercise is super cliche, but is legit the only somewhat “chemical” replacement for opiates and for depression In sober life. And I don’t mean light exercise I mean heavy runners high type. kids also certainly give you fulfillment and motivation. I didn’t read through every post but keep trying,  keep your head up, good luck! P.s methadone taper is a great way to eliminate cravings and ease into it and some people just stay on it!How do you drink like a fish every night while maintaining your sobriety lmaoTry baclofen, its like alcohol's suboxone.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/)Thank you... Ive felt the way the meme describes as well, but only until I began to find real life again.  Not what they tell us life is.  your English was fine.  Thank you.  :-)This is almost the choose life speech Only if you do it in the nude.  :-p  

Im not sure what types of low cost worldly things u might like.  We are all different.  but the key thing is to try it after a few months of sobriety.
Yes. society wants us to be a certain way, and its hard to resist that.[deleted]I used to love skateboarding but the gym has been my high lately. I’m also 2 years off dope. 

What do you like to skate? I’ve always been into big gaps and stairs growing up but I really want to learn transition Same thing happened to me. I quit around age 21 cuz I kept thinking I wasn’t doing shit with my life. I felt guilty about things. I didn’t realize the reason I felt so unhappy when I’d smoke. I just knew it was amplifying my unhappiness. So I stopped for nearly a decade. I’m in such a better place now in my life, and I’m just...content. So now when I smoke I can really enjoy it and laugh at tv or sit on Reddit like right now. I think it all comes down to the pressure you feel in life. That shit gets heavy when you let it. Some years ago a friend asserted that different weed strains made them feel differently. One time I bought a shitty vape oil that sucked but had info on the label saying "this sativa is more energizing" and this other one is "more sedating and... stuff."

Recently I had a bag of Sour Diesel and another containing some kind of Cush. I believe it was the Sour that made me feel anxious, even before bed.... including that introspection, that self analysis going on in my head. 


The following day and days I smoked the other shit until I ran out and the Cush did not apepar to affect me the same way I eventually had to go back to smoking the Sour until I ran out and bought more. 


It wasn't terrible, but I felt like when on the recent batch of cush I felt better psychologically and emotionally. While getting a good night's sleep. Most any weed will make me feel anxious if I smoke it in the day time especially if I gotta go to work.... but if I smoke a batch and don't feel that way during the day then I'm impressed by the strain.[deleted]Omg yes, absolutely. That's a really good point honestly and I agree with it. Not to downplay anyones struggle but once you open pandoras box o' drugs it seems impossible to even go backWhat’s for good though? I have 1 year and 1 day clean and I’m 28 I won’t get into my story but I started iving herion at 18. So if I stay sober until the day I die of natural causes I ain’t ever had an issue but god forbid I relapse which I know is a heavy possibility i might have some issues or if I od in the mcdonalds bathroom and don’t get brought back someone might say damn yo he had some issues he should’ve got help!  Said it many times but i used dope compulsively to the point my kidneys were failing. I still chain smoke cigs and weed trying to get that miniscule hit of dopamine but im clean from heroin/subs 1 year+. Until I get cancer im going to stay off opiates, then im going back full force.Well, that's simply false. Fair and fascinating statement. This is basically why I hope I continue to be reluctant to say "if I could do it..." It's not fair for those who just have a different balance of chemistry in their brain and bodies. It doesn't make them any less of a person and I'm sure it would be way harder for me to be where I am today if I was successful with my IV attempts or if I was in the game for longer before beginning to kick.Yeah man. Swear it can tear you up inside. I mean on one hand you should stay "clean and sober" and live the good life....yeah and then on the other its like the good life is a fucking joke and so boring you wanna just quit it completely. Besides there is nothing wrong with using drugs recreationally once in a while, we just like to take it too far. 

Besides, what do we as humans exist to do? What do are our brains built to do? EXPERIENCE PLEASURE... 

 Its one of those "do I have a problem or is it everybody else?" Type of situations. Im with you but opioids are the best drugs there are, there's no argument about it. Not to mention opioids seem to kick way harder than usual if you've been up a couple of days on stimulants. but you hurt others and might die thoSounds about right, always blazed my own pathOf this list I have 1 thing (a job) and half a roof over my head and I have 15mos clean. Not doing so well compared to this.I know I feel better in life when I don't have a plan and just go with the flow I've noticed...I was never that way though. I always thought I had to do shit by the books. I don't know why but I HAD TO!!! I had a baby really fucking young and dropped out of school but I had to get my Ged and get a job. You would think I'd be happy but I wasn't. I had anxiety like a motherfucker. 

My kids dad committed suicide and it wasn't until then that I really understood my life. After that I guess my life took a turn on some spiritual type journey but it was different than anything I experienced before. It completely turned my world upside down but I found myself happier with my life turned upside down. Almost like you're focused on over coming that tragedy or something. Lol I don't even know if any of this makes sense... 
And when my life gets more stable I start to get more depressed. Kinda like deep inside I don't want to be stable. But I don't know why I wouldn't. I really do envy the people who can just do drugs and stay up all night and don't have to take care of their kids. They can do what they want. But I don't know if I would ever really be happy if I lived that kind of life. Lol it's confusing...Don't be sorry, this discussion is really important and useful. We're (mostly) all still here but the problems also remain. Some people have to play a really terrible hand in life because what's given is in your DNA and there is very little that can be done, medically. When that dysfunction is mental, that is a double penalty because we understand so little about the mental side of health. The drugs are really a sledgehammer to crack a nut but what choice do we have? If you feel bad and you don't know why, the drugs are very appealing. And now you have a new problem.

In my own case, I don't believe I have any major mental health issues but they still brought me very low, to a dark place I never imagined I would go. It took me years of self reflection and therapy to recover but I found a way and now I'm quite happy. When I say the key to the sober life is to find something you love I suppose what I mean is you have to find your particular way. You have to keep experimenting with a new approach and observing the results. Discard the things that don't work and keep the ones that do. Each person is different, there is no magic formula. Also writing sober.Hence the lol. No, I think EVERYONE should drop acid/SAll they do is talk about drugs and the good old days!Good luck with that[deleted]I didn't down vote bcs I respect those who choose to believe but what put me off was the fact that he implies that we, for some fkn reason, need to create an idea in our minds of a higher power bigger than us controlling our lives just to be able to cope with existence and carry on. To me, it sounds like putting a band in front of your eyes and just ignore the whole thing. Yeah, getting food on the table is higher on the priority list.thanks!! i ran a mile last night (took me 9 minuets lol.. I'm 6'3 175... felt 5'7 250 ha) and have been doing 40-50 pushups daily. Not much but i can feel a little difference I want to get back into it.   I used to have an exercise addiction and sustained a lot of permanent damage with chronic pain...but I can swim and walk.  I did myself in on the runners high, but I already had problems and kept going. Highly recommend if you can do in moderation. Baclofen is the bee’s knees �I am going the other. I have thought alot about this. I am going to help others do so as well, and remove anyone who tries to stand in the way. Thank you.  I never really saw them as addictions, but I suppose they are :-)
I just recently got an Eboard!  Inboard M1 :-)Well spoken man. Thank you Yeah, absolutely. It’s pretty difficult to change your perspective on what’s fulfilling and what’s not, but it can be done. Drugs are an easy way to shortcut in to that fulfillment, although usually with negative repercussions following if left unchecked> The issue is that 'doing' things that are considered worthwhile net zero fulfillment once you've experienced the pleasure of IV hard drugs. This is especially true if those things are monetarily driven. 


Get into astrophotography, it's quite the money pit but if you got money that isn't making you happy - perhaps spending it on such a hobby will bring happiness. Okay, it's not for everyone... I might get a $1500 mount shipped to me after it being back ordered for over a month only to discover that I get bored taking pictures of the moon and Jupiter under light-polluted skies.


Honestly though, I think I would feel emotionally less satisfied if it wasn't for my turtles and their existence in my life. They remind me that I need to forge onward and find more shit that brings joy to my life. Maybe I'm just afraid to leave them alone, or afraid to consider what it would be like for the remainder of my family to take care to my turtles if I were to meet my demise from an overdose.


I've never experienced IV heroin properly, but I got a glimpse of the sensation with my homemade rig. It was more numbing for me than blissful but a warm blanked regardless of the minutiae which comes to mind. It's easier to list negative reasons for going down that road, the IV drugs and snorted opiates road. All the while it's harder to list things which bring joy after experiencing that.



Working for a living, living the dream or the robotic existence as seen in the picture is quite soul draining and a walk in the park on Saturdays doesn't cut it. I've seen men work all their lives only to deteriorate within a decade of retirement and die. Sure, it's nice knowing that your progeny get your money but such a man who worked his ass off deserved to reap fruits of his labor.  


I don't know where I'm going with this now, pardon my rant. Your statement was far more succinct and poignant. Do you spend anytime outside doing activities you enjoy? I find that is a great way to enjoy some sober fun and get away from the grind.Nicotine makes me sick, I still indulge on occasion but I swear if I smoke a couple of hours after my sub dose I'm more likely to feel nauseous. 

There was a time I could burn a pack a day will little to no ill effects (at least none I can recall) t now if I chain-smoked three in an hour I would feel some kind of way.

I tend to prefer cowboy killers but everyone I know basically smokes menthols.Do you do all the NA / Jesus  stuff? I'm looking into the most sucessful clean people and it seems a lot of them do this NA / Jesus stuff,  unfortunately I just can't bring myself to believe in the supernatural :(You sound like me.  I always say someday I’ll go back to them but today I’m as sober as I can be (kratom and soon medical marijuana).  Heroin does not cause kidney failure.It’s just so ignorant thisyeah no other drug interests me.  Stims nope, weed (hate it), alcohol (too impairing and depressing),  LSD not for me;  opiates are the perfect drug for me personally.  I have friends who hate opiates and am amazed I like them so much, but then the same goes for their DoC's for me[deleted][deleted]1st. Yes, much of that didn’t make much sense. 

2nd. In your first paragraph you say “You would think I'd be happy” — no, I wouldn’t think that. Sounds terrible. My bad lol man we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha. 

And maybe you're right... everyone should take acid/S to open their 3rd eye and get their chakra into alignment and the we can have a new awaking and become the United States of Consciousness... Since it was your idea you can be our new enlightened president. :o :DYou'd be +100 if you had said this the first time, ain't no-one dumb enough for that Jesus shit in 2019Now try that stuff high. LmaoYou’re welcome. This.   Seeking fulfillment is what we are all after.  It is much more difficult to do in the real world sober and it damn near looks impossible once you have taken a pill,snorted or IV a drug and achieved that fulfillment immediately.   That being said if you work hard at fulfillment in sobriety (this means lots of work on mental health - therapy/possibly medication) it can be just as good as the opioid euphoria.  Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. Did you consider having kids/a family?  I thought maybe having a wife and kids might make me happy but honestly my friends with wives/kids; they want to take any opportinity to get out of their houses and come out with us single guys; it's a lot of hard work. My happiest friend is the one who lives aloneYeah, it's true.. even if I'm resistant to it - it always helps lift my mood to go outside for any reason.No, I go to a 666 step program at our lady of the dark lord satanic cathedral.Not in and of itself, but the impurities of street drugs combined with the lifestyle and the muscle deterioration when falling out can cause kidney issues without a doubt. Happened to me. The only stim I like is amphetamine, (which I take most days in the form of adderall), I love weed too and I think weed really shines when you are under the influence already, especially with opioids. 

Other than drinking a bit every now and then, I don't really care for much else. Benzos, psychs, dissos, etc. Are pretty much garbage imo and I dont bother with em. 

Its just that opioids are good literally whenever. I could write a book about why I like opis the best but ill spare everyone, bottom line, they just feel the best. drug usage itself is not necessarily hurtful to others but the illness called addiction is damaging to you and your environment. there is also a difference between recreational and therapeutical usage.others can also be for example neighbors, people you stealing from, your colleagues, family members, partners... society gets hurt by addiction, addicts can’t help it but denying the damage that is done is fueling the desire to use.

of course you are going to die, dying from drugs can be very sudden and early in life.This!I was chosen> we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha.

... can’t tell if you are being sarcastic or not.

But by ending his comment with /s , he was showing sarcasm. [deleted]My first thought � Feel like Jon Stewart in half baked. Ive done it all high... And I thought I had to keep doing it high.   I quit getting high for a time (I wont quit forever) and I quit doing most of those things for awhile as well.  Then after a few months I went back and started some of those things again, or for the first ttime.  I don't know if I will ever reach that same euphoria, I havnt had a relationship since I was 14 (almost 21 now) and have been rejected countless times. My friends barely hangout with me, i'm just so depressed and so damn lonely. Oxy is the only thing that fills the void in my heart. It doesn't help that all throughout high school I was bullied so much that it scarred me emotionally. People treat me like i'm just a junkie and that i'm going to abuse everything i get my hands on. My friends were worried and mad I got an adderall and vyvanse script, yet I havnt abused either and only have abused adderall prior to getting a script when I was in my darkest times. My friends and doctor don't trust me with a benzo script either even though i suffer from panic attacks every week, and I only had xanax in my blood from abuse once when I tried to commit suicide with it and risperadone. Now I can't get benzo scripts unless it's the ER, all because I was suicidal. I don't know what i'm even getting at man life just sucks so much these last few months. Thank god I found some percs, too bad it's my friends grandmas last script, so she wont be able to sell me them anymore after that.The problem is our socieities are not setup this way, life in daily grind is not conducive to this fulfillment. We can try, though. > Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. 

This is my favorite go-to when my friend Tim asks, "do you miss doing dope?"I have found strangely the more opiates I have, the less I think about them - that is if I buy a months supply off the DNM's, I won't really think about them other than doing my dose after work and enjoying the evenings. 

Whereas in WD's I think about them all the time (obviously early wd's you can't focus on anything else; in later WD's you remember the good times)

yet if I am in a dry spell I think a lot more about where I'll get them from - I guess it's the same thing if you were running out of water.

I also think if you use opiates as a crutch to help you with a life/job you hate, that is when you are going to run into much bigger problems staying clean.  I am lucky in a sense I only used them because I enjoyed getting high - I didn't use them to escape any mental stress or any physical pain - they would just be two major triggers to continue using againYes, especially since my brother and wife are planning not to and want to keep their money for vacations and trips to matha's vineyard.

I'm banking on the fact that as a man my ability to produce viable source DNA will last through my 50s.  I want to get my childishness out of my system, learn to or find ways to make more money or get a more established career. Only then would I want to have children. Although I might meet someone and accelerate the turn table, I wont bring children into this world if I can't provide for them. At least, I'd prefer to avoid that stress factor. 


I would love to be like my mom's cool cousin who is single and chills out collecting comic books and whatnot, but I my father's genetics can't afford that level of selfishness. If we are to continue his genes and my genes - I must procreate, eventually. 

I hope to be an older father with money, with a unique peace of mind that comes from experience. Whether I have a boy or girl. Even if my daughter is "hot", I want us to have a good relationship that ensures that she is armed to make good decisions but also free to make her decisions without worrying about me being a judgmental dick about things.

If I have a boy, I my biggest fear is that they'll be lazy and stupid because of modern tech. I might just make my kids uses old technology for a few years and pretend that it's normal. Then again, they will need to learn to code very early on.


I want it both ways.[deleted]Iphone addicti9n and social media are also harmful to us all but are you gonna prosetlyize against that None of us asked to be conceived or born, we never asked to be raised to adulthood, we owe society 0.

&#x200B;

I'm in this game for ME, the only person I will work to benefit that isn't me is my child. The rest are on their own.Oh ok lol I never knew that ending things with "/s" meant it was sarcastic.Nah my man, they clearly ain't all that intelligent if so.Yess!! That one dude that does everything sober but then tries it high. You ever smoked weed...on WEED man?one of my best "highs" ever was on Day 6 or 7 of an oxy kick, first real day of hot sun during the year (UK is a real depressing place most days),  the natural endorphins were flowing; went for a walk in the woods with some ambient music in on my own.  It sounds so lame to read it back now but it was a great sober high.  Unfortunately you can only get this pink cloud by going through 5 days of WD's...

Now if there was only a way to re-create this high on demand, say by ingesting something... but alasI could relate to some extent with two aspects. First with regard to bullying, high school was fine but Junior High School sucked real bad. I wasn't an angel either, I did some edgy things for the sake of fun and amusement which got me in trouble during the lunch period. I remember one time everybody wanted to play basketball but the gym teacher wanted everyone to sit on the bleachers first. Well, I couldn't find a seat and when I did find one in the back corner near the edge, a couple of African-American students were sliding horizontally down the bench into me in order to make me fall off. So I said to myself (probably), "fuck it, I'll just stand next to the bleachers on the floor."


&nbsp;


Perhaps I was a bit aloof, but because I wasn't sitting down the teacher was like "everyone's not sitting down so you all can't play basketball." After that mad black folks (the majority of this class) were ragging on me and beating up on me, only one was at least kind enough to provide clarification as to why they were all pissy. I sorted my shit out but I always felt like very few members of faculty had my back - probably because they had a lot to manage as the school was basically overpopulated on the whole.


&nbsp;

Then if that's not enough, my "best friends" at the time were hit-or-miss. Snotty about academics, but not too good to take shortcuts and cheat on exams when possible. Perhaps I should've employed more of the same tactics, the truth is that I'm too lazy to do my school work - cheating or not. I hate when they used to send out deficiency notices in the middle of the semester - sort of like a midterm report card. One time I'm walking home with my "friends" on that day when we got deficiency notices and my "friend" is just basically telling me "you're a lazy bitch." Be that as it may, although I'm definitely not a bitch in any form.. it's none of his fucking business. 


&nbsp;

One smart Jewish-Christian friend was snotty but he did honest work and achieved a lot of shit as well as extra-curricular shit. The other friend who called me a "lazy bitch" was more hardcore Jewish - raised by an Israeli father. He didn't have the best home life, bullied by his brother Derrick (same one who middles dope) and so  I think it was just reflex for him to be a dick about shit. We all matured, I mean like I still wouldn't have him do my taxes as he is an accountant now because of the shame associated with making less money and letting him see that fact.


&nbsp;

Now, back to you... I often feel down and sure, Xanax would help, Valium would be wonderful too but there is so much downside potential associated with becoming dependent on either. \*\*Physical activity always helps me feel better and cuts back on anxiety.\*\* Sometimes I find it hard to start, many days I look forward to the end so that I can go to bed - sometimes I go to bed way earlier than possible. I slept 12 hours last week in one night because of that. 


&nbsp;


I'm still very confused about how my emotions work when I wake up super early so that I can have "me time" before work. I get super tired in the afternoon and then I get a second wind later in the evening.. it's like my biological clock is tuned for a "better mood" at certain times.


&nbsp;


What I want to convey is, how we feel today is an amalgamation of shit that has happened before - which we cannot change. We can only try to control or wrestle control over how we handle it. I'm not you and I'm not your doctor (not that you agree with your doctor at the moment) but I really believe in the downside potential in using benzos. Hell, people talk about downside potential in taking Subs yet I do so because I feel that the risk of having a hard time getting off was worth it in order to have a chance at breaking the cycle.


&nbsp;

Knowing how my snottier friends would act, I've avoided sharing anything with any of them about my addiction. Some of them know or heard rumors, that's how I had to deal with a failed intervention in July of 2017. I bullshitted my way out of it and took another year before I switched completely to subs. 


&nbsp;

One times I saw one of my better "smart" childhood friends and he seemed to be genuinely concerned for my well being, it's like I could see it in his eyes or something... that he heard shit about me and heroin. Another too who was buying stuff at my job. Both cases I was able to reasonably assure them or give a solid appearance of well being. Especially now, as I get into an expensive hobby like astrophotography -- how could I be an addict? It's sort of like how I said "how can I be an addict, I would have sold this stack of laptops if I was."

&nbsp;


With regards to not wanting to be treated like a junky; Cliff's brother has his suspicions about me being a junky but I denied it. I will not open up to him because of the time I took acid and watched Iron Man II with him. He fucking told one or two of our "straight-edge" friends for whatever reason. So one day I'm in the Vitamin Shoppe and an old friend who ultimately became a cop recently, he was like "I heard you did acid" in a fucking smug ass lame ass tone. 

&nbsp;


Of course I asked, "where did you hear about that?" His response: "the grapevine." That motherfucking chicken shit, if you got the balls to fucking tell me you know I did some acid have the goddam balls to tell me how you fucking know. I can figure it out anyway and I'm not gonna go and do something about it either way. Except maybe speak to the source and be like "dude, why'd you tell that friend about that? I'd like to keep that shit private because people go on tangents and spread gossip." I don't like when people hear something and share their judgemental tone. Do on to others as you would like them to do on to you.

&nbsp;



I hope something in here serves as food for thought or helps in some way through relatability.Yep, and that is why recovery is so fucking hard. But you have to find a way to incorporate fulfillment into your life. We could probably fix a lot of social problems if we fixed a lot of social problems, hahaha"Do you miss doing dope"  -     "Do you miss having sex with beautiful women" or "Do you miss eating delicious food"You ever shoot up after scoring before you drive home? Then you are potentially affecting other people in a bad way, or will eventually.Yo bro,i feel the same way but i have a fiery vengeance in me to want to tear down the man made conditions setup which funnel us into drug use. I have a picture in my head and i know it is real and it is a world where people dont willingly commit slow suicide by drugs or any othet method to drown out whatever static noise is being shoved in faster than i can shovel out. People ARE to blame for this mess. 

I watched my dad self medicate with alcohol and anger my whole life and i thought i was smarter, but look at the path i chose. I dont even hate him for it out of thr moment, how could i. Just trying to copeIt’s ironic you brought up sarcasm after he used /s

:p[deleted]bruuuhh that shit wildI feel good from opiates, but the kind of high you are describing... I feel better from that. Thank you for taking the time for this reply man, I really appreciate it. I just used the last of my oxy, and probably won't be able to get any forever or a very long time, so I suppose today is the first day of recovery again. I'm gonna try doing some physical activity, maybe just a dog walk to start, but something is better than nothing. Hopefully I can be happy without drugs some day. 

&#x200B;

Thank you again for this reply man <3Definitely not by incorporating the corporate lifestyle though.Tim who asks that question about dope, I asked him if he had any loss in sex-drive and he said yes. However, his sex drive is fucking strong --- strong enough that he goes to brothels every week behind his wife's back. A man without a sex drive doesn't need to spend money on sex, unless that's just his form of masturbation and he just does pays professionals to do it for him.

&#x200B;

I do enjoy delicious food and having to  worry about obtaining dope. Really just glad not to have to deal with middles like Derrick who say they will be confidential but open their big mouth the instant it benefits them for any reason.[deleted]yeah I want to change this dumbass society too but what can we do?

I work in a school, I always tell the students do not vote for the mainstream parties (UK here), and if you do, you have no right to complain about the State as you are a direct cause of it. Luckily despite the Teen stereotype a lot of them are not stupid, plus they have access to the 'Net so they know the score. I show them the websites that list the sleaze all of our supposed "betters" (politicians etc) get upto over here (the anti-drug, church going Member of Parliament who was caught doing a line of cocaine off of a young teenage boys chest...) We have the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. You can pretend that it's fine and reasonable to ignore th overwhelming evidence against it all you want, just tricking yourselves. and it's not really up for debate lmao. Any religious person is a moron.Unless you're willing to drink the coolaid and feel at home in the company's hermetic office environment. Still, they'll kick anyone out on their ass once they become more trouble than they're worth. Offering golden parachutes to those higher up in the caste, using HR to cover their asses legally when they feel that someone needs to be "let go." yea man if I want to do some opiates after work, then who is anyone to tell me I can't?  Because I could potentially affect someone in a bad way?

So by that logic then fatties should all be put into work camps until they weigh a healthy weight, because they also affect others in a bad way by causing global warming?  

Should we all be a Master Race of people who are 100% healthy? Should we be forced this way against our will?  (currently over here our Elites are trying to force us all to be a non smoking, non drinking, perfectly healthy Master Race. Meanwhile these Elites are all fat, drinking, drug taking, lazy wastes of space - but it is not about our health. It is about us taking less sick days and working harder for them.)[deleted]That's another point really, the fact that we are at the loose end of the stick, and that they couldn't care less about anyone below themselves. Thus why bother doing anything for them assholes, other than the bare minimum to keep collecting your pay check.My evidence would be what god would create and allow such a terrible existence?

If there were an all powerful god, and he created everything, including all the evil shit, then he is a fucking asshole dick cunt fucker.

I hope you’ll respond. You can't be serious.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: hmm, Content: , ups: 1118, downs: 0Made me laugh dopesick as fuck. Take your upvote.I actually tested positive for opiates on a Drug test recently by eating an everything bagel the morning of the test. My probation officer didn't believe me, of course lolLololIt’s always the fckn bagel.Damn poppy seed bagels get you every timeOk.... this one was goodOk you made me laugh and i woke up and pissed my dog off.  He’s giving me the ol’ stink eye. He’lol pass back out soon though lol. LolThings that make ya go ¿QUE? Also you shouldn’t  be smoking babies. No, you should snort babies the high is cleaner.i knew those everything bagels had some jizz on em“......shouldn’t a got that butter AND cream cheese.”Ahh all those people who don’t read twitter probably think you thought this up :-)

Do you have any more gems from other people’s twitter accounts?u/CockRaterGirlWow laughing whilst sick. You must of found this unearthly hilarious. Hope the sickness will be taking care of, the impending sickness for me is right around the bend,fucking again ��I had a very faint positive at the methadone clinic. I was so confused and I was swearing up and down that I didn't touch anything because I hadn't taken anything in over 3 years at that point but they probably hear that all the time.

I realized I ate the everything bagel the night before and that morning and she said she believed me but I still told them to send it to get tested and I came back that afternoon to sample again and it was negative. I was always told it was a myth. Didn't they disprove this on mythbusters?Good luck finding crushable babies anymore.Damn, don't you hate it when you eat jizz and get pregernante?uh what LolI would rather be mildly high and staring down the barrel of a five day withdrawal than sober, which I currently amSry to hear fellow. Love your name, Ruby is da shit, hope you get well soon bro! Late reply, but is your name a $B reference?Nah, they proved that it happens. Just employer drug tests usually Bing at a higher point than government ones because they know small things like that can set a test off. I heard putting them in the microwave helps. You can still find them in Canada. i hate when i have my everything bagel and get the preggers :( Idk man I def don't miss the days of constantly being on the edge of withdrawal not even being able to get high anymore with shitty tar just using to not be sick. But it's such a nice day. Yupyupp
Ahhh got it. Good to knowOr dissolving them in coca colaThats where im at The more you know. And knowing is half the battle.

My buddy would be sweating bc he did the wake up bag last night lol[Free R Kelly!](https://youtu.be/HiIla9Mqo1I) This is incredible [removed]Isn’t this photo shopped? No it's on purpose, otherwise kid be out and never listen to there bullishThen does he get all pissed off when you suggest hurrying it up? It's like they have zero self awareness. Either that or they get some fucked up satisfaction out of screwing people around in stupid petty ways. The good dealers make so much more not fucking around. Probably also don't get popped over super petty shit or at least not as often.When I was a benzo junkie my guy would forget where he left his bars all the fucking time since he was a bar head too, even though he had huge bags of literally hundreds (probably thousands). It’d always be in some dumb spot like behind the detergent in the laundry room or in one of the kitchen cabinets. Once he left them at a barber shop and he made me drive him up there (he said he’d throw me 20) and there was a ziplock bag of at least 500 double stacks still on the counter where he cut his hair and nobody fucking noticed, not even the bar heads who work there. One guy I know is lonely af and has no friends so he’ll sit there and talk to you for a fucking hour. It’s so annoying A dope dealer that was upset about junkies wanting dope?  Wtaf �So what did you do?This is the R Kelly interview on CBSAs I understand it, they're not. This was just an interview on CBS that got a bit heated and emotional. Props to the interviewer though, she stayed totally calm and chill while he was freaking the f out. Franco- "Hey, you ever think you could like pull the plug on someone? Hypothetically I mean"
Rogen- "What!? Y-ymean like on her? I dunno man I don't got a lot of time, I got to go to my girlfriend's dinner and shit I... I could go on all day about... euthanasia."My dude lives in the same apt complex so delivers to my door. So even it im waiting it's in my bedBoondocks did it.?Oh I'm sure the power goes to many of their heads. I had a guy who did that kind of shit on purpose. For opsec purposes he would refuse to meet up (used bitcoin for payment) and would drop off the product at some random location where you'd have to go and pick it up. Honestly, I'd prefer some annoying conversation than having to go fish under a toilet at a bar.It's for security purposes too. Can't have people heading in and out within minutes.This who tf else does he expect to sell too? Kindergarten teachers and zen monks?Lied and said i had to go home and take a shower, that id be back but i never came back.

the sad thing is ive met others who were scared to death to be alone .   They werent all on drugs. One guy was filthy rich and just couldnt stand not to have a crowd around at all times.

even if they were tearing up his shit and trashing his place and taking advantage of him and borrowing money ect...I wish R. Kelly would go away (and take the Trumps with him).

TO SLOVENIA!!!

*snapping a whip*A lot of black ghetto plugs are racist as fuck and get a kick out of fucking around with white customers, especially if they look wealthier or like timid college kids. Or they will make power moves or requests, then laugh about the "fucking wyt boi" they just got to drive them around. They get off on the feeling they have power over those they see as having a better life than them, a lot absolutely despise junkies too.

&#x200B;

A lot of the white plugs especially the older ones are the "I'm lonely" type, or they are also junkies serving to support their habit and want you to use with them so they feel like less of a junkie somehow or listen to their life story and play therapist and other kinds of nonsense.That dude sounds paro, but I bet he hasn’t gotten caught.  Why would he put it under the toilet in a bar? A place with cameras? Shitty opsec right there.Fr I’m fucking done ��Comedy goldSounds like jessie from breaking bad Damn. Seems like a tweakers dreamI've only ever had hood connects in 11 years and have never experienced what you're talking about. One of my guys actually called and apologized for being an angry asshole to my girl and I. Everyone's different. I can certainly say I've ran into the 2nd. I've never really dealt with many black folks and the ones I have dealt with have been really cool except 1 experience.

The lonely type that will front just to have somebody to talk to. When I was younger in my early 20s I had an older dealer in his mid 40s. When me and my friends would stop by he would think of the situation as more of a hangout than a sell. I think he was trying to re live his younger days. He would talk and talk and it was so hard to get away. Especially when you're sick and just want the shot asap. A few moments I'm not proud of are the times I sat over there just to get free dope. He would also front just to have somebody to talk to lol I felt bad for him.99% of their sales are on the Dark Web where they're a big vendor. This was just a favor they did for me.It was dumb as fuck. But I didn't know anyone else. He mostly sold online and I figured  out he was in my city so I asked if he'd do something direct. So it wasn't like he had a bunch of people going into a bar's bathroom and then leaving. And it was a different place every time, which made it very annoying. But when you're a junkie and you're desperate...almost forgot about that,,,,,,bb always portraying realness in the show ,good team of writers....that part in the series is soo depressing, when he's just zombies out with the big speakers always playing, and the roomba lolI once had a dealer ask me to meet him at a convenience store, probably the worst place to meet for a drug deal. Then when we both got there, a cop was outside. So he motions to me to follow him into the store where I hand him the cash as we walk in. Rather than just hand me my satchel, he tosses the bag on the store shelf in front of 3 employees. What a god damned moron. Now what, I’m supposed to take something off a store shelf and put it into my pocket, looking like a thief with a cop right out side.... *sigh* @@@@@@@@@@ Title: A couple of years ago she saved my life. I was nodding out on benzos and opiates super hard and started to choke on my tongue because I was lying on my back. She jumped on my stomach which caused me to sit up. I owe her a lot., Content: , ups: 1069, downs: 0Narcat?Absolute hero cat. She wanted to make sure you'd still be around to feed her, servant. Did you name her narcan?Believe it or not cats have super senses and can sense things people can't there are cats that know when their owner has cancer before they or anyone else even does.Good Kittyshes a cutie :)This is amazing ❤️❤️❤️. Sorry to hear about you possibly almost loosing your life but I'm glad your furbaby saved you!!Good kittySome cats can be really good kids.You cant swallow your own tongue.  So I'm calling bullshit also.  We get it. You vapeIs your cat part Russian blue? She looks very similar. We have one as well. Best cat ever. The real og Are u still using eitherThose Russian blues always have a resting bitch face. Russian blues every one I’ve know has been crazy expect for one who was just mean because he was old and had health issues to where he couldn’t clean so he had dreads on his back. My dad had one that lived to be 19 and only died because he got into a fight with another cat one night when we let him out to dick around in the garden in the front. His tooth broke off in that fight and it got infected which killed him he was too old to fight it off :(. Was one of the few times I saw my dad cry, it was his cat while he was in college. My cat died 2 years ago one that I had since I was 8 and lived with me when I got my own place at 22, I cried like a bitch for weeks, it was hard watching him go down and slowly die over his last year of life but he was extremely sweet and loving that last year. He was such a badass cat, I don’t know if I’ll ever have a cat like him. He did not act like a cat his personality was more like a human. I almost nodded off to my death due to a combination of opiates and benzos in my car but was saved by a stranger who screamed "fuckin junkie!" Honestly, that person unknowingly changed my life greatly; the crazy thing about that event was the comment wasn't even aimed towards me..�����Ohhhh whatta cutie, and so erm...well fed �[deleted]It's not actually possible to choke on your tongue. Source: I used to lifeguard and I took multiple CPR/rescue breathing classes.Crazy how our furry friends have our backs! I passed out on bars and Roxies too and my little guy was scratching at my chest so hard he broke the zipper off the jacket I was wearing at the time! Funny because it didn't wake me up, but when I woke up the next morning you can imagine the level of confusion I experienced when looking down at my jacket....lolI call bull lol sorry broI thought the same thing, then saw you posted if too!! LolLegit name �Never fear Narcat is here!!We need super cats with narcan claws to chill with while noddingAin’t that the truthNarcat I wouldn't call it super senses. Both cats and dogs have a far superior sense of smell and hearing. 

We generally don't realise that, but our body odour changes a lot depending on our physical condition. Both dogs and cats can be trained to warn a diabetic owner of a low blood sugar situation or an epileptic seizure. Dogs have an advantage here due to how much easier it is to train them. Also dogs have evolved to be vety good at reading human emotions. So a trained service dog can anticipate panic attacks or otherwise comfort an unstable person.

Long story short, it's not super senses, it's that the human that feeds them and cares for them suddenly smells and sounds differently. And that's a cause for concern.My cat used to lay on my chest for hours licking my face when I was using. Though she maybe just couldn't resist tasting me while waiting for the inevitable overdose to start devouring me. They do! My sisters cat knew I was in labor before I knew. She even followed me into the shower meowing at me. I was so confused until I felt it. Cats will also eat their owners eye balls after a couple hours dead where as dogs will start starve to death before considering eating their human 

Source: am dog guySuper sensesThere was one time she shit in my bathtub, then threw up on the carpet. But for the most part 10/10 So I googled that, turns out you’re right. So I’d have to assume either my throat relaxed to the point it restricted my airway, or I was choking on my saliva Bro you wanna see a smoke ring bro? Bro I’m wicked good at vape tricks bro She’s a dilute tortoiseshell

[She has very unique colouring ](https://imgur.com/a/evpmF0o) No, I’m on subs now since the start of this year Back off, The vet says she’s a very healthy weight :p



It’s gross, but you’re not wrong Cats are better than you’ll ever be, you probably think humans are better than animals. Yea it’s already been established elsewhere in the comments Ive seen a post and thought of a pun then gone to post it only to find somone beat me to it many a time ahaAm willing to invest in this project.Even better lolI’m type 1 diabetic funny enough. I knew someone with a blood sugar dog when I was younger, they’re goddamn amazing In a way, you are calling it a super sense though - superior (super) sense of smell.Dogs eventually will eat their owners too if they’re stuck with their owner’s body and have nothing else to eat! Dogs just wait a little bit longer than cats do to start.... probably because they’re so much slower than cats. Hehe.A couple of hours? I'm pretty sure it's more like after a week and the cat is starving to death.Go lick your dogs asshole My turtle doesn't think twice about shitting in the bath tub. I think it's automatic for them.

As for puking, my friend has a cat who usually pukes after eating leaves off of the house plants.Probably just had your throat in a restricted position that made everything feel compressed. Only way you can swallow your own tongue is to cut it loose from the bottom of your mouth first. 

Edit: perhaps you have sleep apnea that you only noticed when you were half-conscious and nodding out. Sleep apnea is a condition where as you sleep you’ll randomly stop breathing throughout the night, and it can sometimes feel like you’re choking. It has varying degrees of severeness, but it could be life threatening if left unchecked. Maybe go to a sleep clinic and have a sleep study done if you think that could’ve been what happened.  Bro fr bro? That’s wild broI wanna see tricks!!OP she's a real pretty one. I have a male cat that looks exactly like her!!!

More pics! I'll send you pics of mine if you'd like to see her twin hahaha.Congrats man Gotta love comments like these. How much do you hate humans? Look, the only reason why there is such a thing as "don't treat animals poorly" is because you are a human with a developed sense of what is right. There is currently nothing else in this universe that we're aware of that uses any kind of moral aside from instinct. Everytime you try to denounce human kindness, remember that a human just spoke those words. Not saying humans are superior, but we are the only ones even making this distinction[deleted][deleted][deleted]Right? Now I just look like a copy cat :( 

Couldn’t help myself. Reddit likes puns. It will save lives and cats. Its got no downsides. Someone $$$ invest asap into r&dit‘s all just words anyways, one can call it chubbahibbadub, doesn‘t change the awesomeness lolHehe good pointGoogle.. The truth is out there. I'm sure it varies, but at the end of the day you just never know if you and the kitty kat had this super epic soul mate relationship or if it just tolerating you and slowly bending you to do their will IMO Did you come here just to stick up for cats. It's a fucking joke based on facts so I think there is probably a much better chance that you are in fact the feline cunnilingus champion here. Live a very long and happy life fellow animal lover.You might want to tell your friend to be careful with their cat. Like dogs, cats will eat greenery to cause them to vomit, like a weird cleanse.

However some plants are poisonous to cats and by eating them, your friend’s cat could be getting sick and that’s why it’s vomiting.  I know for sure I don’t have apnea, this was the only incident I had experienced chocking on nothing. After this I wouldn’t lie down if I was nodding and I started to sleep on my side just for safety. 

It is totally possible that as I was nodding out I moved my head in a way that restricted my airway. Again I was lucky this was the only incident i had chocking Bro fr. I got mad sponsors bro you don’t find talent like mine very often bro I’d love too! I see other grey cats, but very few have the same colouring as mine, I don’t think she’s like a super valuable type of breed or anything, but I think her coat colouring is pretty rare 

So I’d love too see some look alikes :)Thanks, appreciate it I hate humans a lot actually & that’s not gonna change. I understand what you’ve written here but I’m confused about the point your trying to make, are you saying we shouldn’t care to treat animals & plants for that matter with respect because they can’t make the distinction ? Honestly you don't.  You rely on millions of humans keeping society together everyday.  You don't value dogs over humans, you take for granted humans.  You may value dogs personal company over humans.Lol so you would swerve out of the road for a dog and not a human? Nice broDamn, I really wish people like you could see how much my cat loves people & how excited he gets when we come home. What your saying is partly true but is way generalized, this dog or cat person thing actually has a lot of psychology behind it IMO, but ALL animals deserve to be respected & loved unconditionally because they serve a purpose far more wholesome than any human being ever could as all we do is hurt and destroy this planet. The UK actually did a study on this (surprising I know lol)  they found that the dogs waited a day longer than the cats but BOTH ate their dead owners. Hell, if I was locked in with no food supply, I’d eat you too… prob sooner than dogs and cats. Yeah actually you are an asshole because you used “kys”, I’m not gonna tell strangers to kill themselves. Like I said there’s a lot of psychology behind this animal preference & what I’m seeing is that happier people like dogs & more emotional or sad folks like cats. But the bottom line is I don’t want people treating animals poorly because the internet seems to always favor dogs under the premise of your “joke” about them eating their owners eyeballs after they pass or whatever. They’re animals & they have instincts. Personally I don’t give a damn if an animal was to eat me, at least then we served as some kind of actual purpose. Nah i feel ya. Its the first time ive gotten in on time ahaJesus your not wrong look at all those upvotes ahahahahIt would be kind of a downside if you’re just chilling and your cat scratches you playfully and you’re thrown into PWD.I'm not a cat person so I wouldn't be surprised either way. Owners do nothing but provide their cats with food... Even in death.feline cunnilingus = pussy eater.  HUR HUR.

Source: Am a cunning linguist and a master debater.[deleted]I’ve woken up choking on my own spit before like to the point to where I jumped up knocking shit all off of my counter freaking out trying to breath, my nose my stopped up to but eventually got a few breaths in through my nose enough to calm down and clear my throat shit was scary lolNo, I guess I didn't really explain my point now that I see it. I'm sry, english isn't my native language. I agree that we should treat all animals with respect, infact that's why I wrote this entire thing hahaha. I instantly felt like you were the type of guy to say you hate humans. Of course, I'm not expecting you to change opinions just because a stranger on the internet tells you to. I just find it sad to see people hate on humans that much, when the concept of good and evil itself was made by us. The fact that you are putting animals above yourself and want to protect them that dearly, even though it gives you no benefit, proofs that humans are the only ones to bring kindness and mercy to this world. A dog cannot understand a concept as complicated as that, he just really really likes you. I think we have an obligation to protect less developed animals. That's why I tryed to at least explain my view, because a lot of people seem to forget that they are humans themselves.

sry for the giant essay, have a nice day :) [deleted]I think the “copy cat” part was another pun-type joke to continue on the cat* trend since he missed his first shot. Sorry for the mini r/whooosh (always forget, 2 or 3 o’s)

Edit: *cat not carNot wrongGee, that got out of hand pretty fast. It's true tho, dogs are loyal AF and usually won't eat their owners. It's a somber beautiful thing to see a dog moaning next to his or her dead keeper.

I still might trust a cat more than a yorkie tho.
what a cunt you are[deleted]I completely understand what your saying friend and your English is A okay� no need to apologize for anything at all, but one thing I want to say is there is a major benefit from caring for these helpless plants & animals, at least for me there is. Nothing brings me more joy to be honest. Your despicable, why do you insist on trying to argue that cats are soulless. My cat literally runs around the fucking house & starts playing with all his toys and even dropping them at my feet wanting to play as soon as I walk in. Did you have a bad experience with felines growing up or something?! I don’t get why your so hung up on this, cats are amazing creatures that show us the same level of affection that we show them, if they were so terrible we wouldn’t be keeping them as pets since the beginning of human civilization. Defs a whooosh moment ahahaha“Come here buddy, who’s my cute little guyyy-OH FUCK, just kill me now!”.[deleted]that's because you're a good person :) [deleted]It’s ok cause I think he had a whooosh moment as well and completely missed that you missed his joke.[deleted]That would be so fucking shit cool. Really shitty too, but hey at least there's recycling going on.I appreciate that, hope you have a great day. I’ll help with your legit confusion then. Do you know what role plants play on this earth? Everything we eat, all our drugs, our clean air all come from Plants that are raped and abused. They just like animals are living and don’t have a way to fend for themselves against the greed of human beings tearing them down, controlling them or completely wiping them out without a care. So yes I consider them helpless, care to argue about this matter more? Ever heard of mass deforestation? Wtf I upvoted you and you're only back to 1, your post was hilariousIt’s gonna be the new diet trend. Will be started by Extreme liberal Vegans who begin to realize that eating plants is still killing/eating life and recycle to save the planet yo! Are you a vegetarian?  I hate people too.[deleted][deleted][deleted]tbh it's sad people think about plants the way they do. sure they can't express themselves, doesen't mean you don't have to look after them Don’t own a home & don’t have a lawn but if it was up to me I wouldn’t mow it. I don’t even smoke pot dude, just cause I give a fuck about the planet doesn’t mean I’m stoned & if being stoned makes you care about the things you should care for then maybe you should be smoking. Also don’t own anything made of leather or fur. Was busy all day & don’t have notifications on this app, excuse me for responding 7 hours late. why tho @@@@@@@@@@ Title: One year apart!❤️, Content: , ups: 1028, downs: 01 year clean??Wild that’s awesome you’re glowing wow you’re really pretty!Wow. Just wow. Keep up the good work OP, you look great!!!

&#x200B;That’s cool. You look so young dude. Well done ��Keep up the good work.  And, as my psychiatrist tells me, *remember where you came from.*Left pic. �Wow I can’t believe that’s the same person! Congratulations. Remember, if you ever consider doing it “just one time” it will turn into “just weekends” then it will be a full blown relapse. My friend went 3 years clean and then about 5 months ago he got offered a single 4 milligram dilaudid, he said “fuck it I’ll do just this one pill and then that’s it, no more”. He’s now dope sick 3 days a week and going back to methadone clinic any day now. Anyways good job random person!! I’m 3 weeks clean now I hope I make it to 9 months like you!U look beautiful no matter what but def can see the different i assume u got clean? It looks goodCongrats, Ive been off the dope for a year and a half now, it's crazy how quickly things can changeAnd here I am just popped oxy for the first time ever. Waiting for it to hit.. Congratulations and you look great in both pics honestlyWay to go, girl. Proud of you. Am I the only one who likes the left one more? :D (only talking about the pictures)Happy for you! But you look pretty healthy on both pictures. I think if you would laugh on the first picture too, there wouldn't be a huge difference :)You look good in both tbh just dressed differently. Congrats on getting clean. Damn, if that ain't encouraging! Thanks for the motivation!If there's anything I've learned about addiction (especially to opiates), it'll steal your soul if you're not careful.  Meth will compromise your dopamjne reward pathways and rewire the way you think in a bad way. Plus it's cardiotoxic af, I'm thankful I never got TOO fucked up in the head after a year of doing meth IV.  Nowadays I just blow tree, take Adderall every now and take Xanax/kpins for anxiety. Anyway, congrats man that's a big milestone. You have my support �✌️What was your DOC? Aw, what a huge difference! And what a huge victory!! Keep going girl, you got this. Don't know you but am proud of you. �❤Awesome way to go and that's an amazing change! Always inspiring to see others making it happen one day at a time!r/gonesober candidate.What a difference. Congratulations!are you on any replacement drugs like suboxone?  that’s what i’m on now. only that. i just picked up my script actually. i know i’m not fully clean while on it, but at least i’m not acting all pathetic anymore. lol[deleted]Agent Scully?You look fantastic!!! ❤️❤️❤️Wow
Great work! The difference is astounding! 
Keep being strong! :)Wow! You’re beautiful � 4 months clean here. Keep it up!Congrats girl! I know how hard it is✌� much respect ; i wonder how does it feel to be reborn, to be back in life and reality again, they say the eyes are windows to the soul and i see a beautiful , unchained free spirit ✌�I'd tap datYou're really strong for making it out. Im so glad to see that your happy now too. Thanks for sharing.So pretty! You can see the difference. Great job. Get yourself a good milkshake or something that's a treat and celebrate. You deserve it. And your inspiring. Congrats.Will you marry me?  So beautiful.19 and addicted to oxy (with fent) over here. This is motivating and comforting to me knowing there’s still time to change.Tbh the doped out looks better.Looking cute AF in the right hand pic...great job congratsGirl on the left I'd run with for a while and ruin her life.

Girl on the right, too intimidating, haha.  Congrats on your sobriety.Wow,  you're looking so much healthier.  Beautiful girl either way.   Congratulations,  lotta hard work and dedication!  Keep up the good work! Wow you look like a completely different person. Sobriety looks good on you. Just celebrated 30 months clean myself. My transformation wasn’t as drastic lol.  Keep it up. It only gets easier. I'm gonna take a verbal dump because I'm in the middle of my addictions and I'm fucking miserable.

Do I think there's a genuine, no-relapse risk way out of addiction? Of course there is, but our society doesnt want to practice it. People become so scared of drugs and addiction that they take over your decisions completely, prohibiting the extremely critical trial and error you need to experience to recover. 


Either that, or they go with the other toxic extreme by completely ostracizing you from their lives, making you a complete outcast unworthy of a basic human relationship.

Now you, you are an attractive girl and as such you probably experienced the former, where your family and friends step in and say whatever they need to say to convince you you aren't well and need to turn yourself over to them (and the medical professionals who aim to make thousands off of you). You'll inevitably crack under the pressure since you're not really happy with yourself, submitting to whatever they want to do with you.

You'll go to rehab and they'll detox you and let you spill your feelings in a bunch of group therapies. Those therapies will be a bunch of addicts in denial about drugs, silenced by the counselors. The counselors will try to brainwash the prohibition standpoint and they'll hope you'll come out of there with the idea that you're not allowed to use drugs ever.

Time will pass and people will commend you for your sobriety. You'll slowly start to realize that you're doing this for other people and not yourself.

That voice in your head was never silenced because other people have forced sobriety on you rather than you enduring trial and error like you should have. One day that voice in your head will make you crack, and you'll go use again and you may or may not overdose.

You fall into the same cycle for a while and someone will find out, subsequently break the trial and error process you need to experience to recover and try and force sobriety on you. And you'll probably submit because - again you're a pretty girl and you've got the works in society for support.

The only true way out of addiction is to use and use and use again until you are so sick of it, even the worst suffering doesnt deter you from sobriety. You and only you can decide to stop and any attempt at being stopped by others is a quick road to relapse and overdose. /endrant


Go ahead, white knights, do your fucking worst in defense.Man filters do wondersIs this where I get in line to compliment some fishing for said compliments?

These posts are as cringy as the "look at my pupils I'm so faded lolz" posts.The difference is crazy ! Bitch you are annoying as fuckThe consistency of your responses show just how excited but ready you are for the rest of your life. So very glad and happy for you!! You look like a baby panda! [deleted]Wow, you really don't look like the same person and yes, that's a good thing. Congrats on getting sober! Maybe one day for me, maybe not.Congrats!! You look amazing! Very happy for you :)you look great, thanks for the inspiration ♡I'm glad you're clean!Woah. Looks like a different person. Congrats, if this is a “sobriety post”Cool cool, you’re very welcome, as well as a total beb �Welcomes �how much were you doing on a daily basis if you dont mind me asking? tryin to get some context. Congrats on your growth not only physically but you can actually see your spiritual and mental state improves your confidence and your happiness Hell yeah. Congrats. My one year just passed as well!Billie Eilish > dime piece in 9 month�Congrats! I had almost a year sober before this recent relapse so I know how amazing it feels. Luckily this was only a small slip up so WD isn't too bad and I'm staying focused. 

I started young too, glad we didn't lose more of our lives...5 months clean myself! Congratulations ���Absolutely incredible, what a beautiful transformation. Truly inspiring, the difference in the 2 pictures is staggering. Never forget how far youve come. This post made me happy, thank you!How old are you? Asking because your head/face seems to have really evolved and it cant all be down to addiction right? Anyways keep it up. Looking great! ��� I'm glad you got through it! I've lost many due to opioids and I've seen a few clean up and I am more proud of them than everif that flag on your wall is the state your in then congrats fellow nutmeggerAm i gunna have to be the only one addressing the elephant in the room? The pic on the left is way, way hotter lol.You look a bit like Billie Eilish on the pic on the left. I'm just 3 months sober, and it feels great. People out there need to know that you can get better, but you need help. Please look into rehab, and recovery places. Don't wait until it's too late, or you're forced to do it. And make sure you are doing it for yourself![**r/whiteknighting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiteknighting/)I'm so happy for you, sweetie. I'm a grandma, and I'd give you a great big grandma hug if I could. 

I am not educated about eating disorders other than what the average person reads and learns, but I've lived 6 decades now, and I've seen how women distort their physical traits and focus on them. I've watched as we've gone from a society that was, in the 70s, telling women to think of themselves as more than a sexual partner for the pleasure of men to the present where we tell women how strong and capable they are, while writing articles in women's magazines about how to sexual appeal to others....and ads in those magazines featuring airbrushed thin and flawless bodies. I was enjoying happy hour recently in a very trendy and popular place, and I noticed the rap song playing was talking about women in the most insulting and sexually repressive ways. Around me were young women moving to the music and singing along. I can't express how screwed up all this is, and the damage it does to a woman if they let any of this in. 

All that to say....be realistic with yourself about what a woman's body should look like. Be different from what society is telling you.....the mixed signals are out there, and they have no business even being allowed into your space....you are way too good for that. Fight for you, your body and your health. Don't ever give in. If you can accomplish what you have already, you can challenge the dysfunctional and skewed thinking about your body that comes from both within and without. 

I want you to live to be a grandma. Despite the struggles along the way, it's just the most fantastic thing in the world to march into the next decade of your life, over and over again. Do it like you mean it. And I promise you, a normal aging imperfect body will be your best friend and take you everywhere you want to go.how did you do it? i need help!Em fee ee4leeeeeeeell lleellelleelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellleellelelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleellleelleelleelleellellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllrlYou look pretty in both pictures, but sooo much healthier and happier in the second one! I hope you're able to keep it up, girly! Great work, it's inspiring!What was your motivation to quit?/ why u quit?Love cures all things, was your libido also nonexistent with opioids? 

I’m a guy and on Kratom I look at hot girls with same desire as car.Wow what a transformation, you look great!You are amazing. Keep up the effort, it shows![deleted]Congrats!! It’s amazing what sobriety can do! I’m about 4 and half years now and it gets better and better everyday!! Keep it up ❤️Yeah!! You get it, girl! Congratulations![deleted]Damn you look strong, I am not even addicted to drugs but I struggle with my addictions still (video games and porn mainly). I don't know what would I have done if I was in your shoes because I can't even quit these addictions they are nothing like heroin or meth, my mind tricks me and tells me that I'd ratger die than quit these... I am trying to moderate them at the moment, hopefully it will work this time. Good for you on getting clean OP, I feel happy for you and sending you positive vibes!!!You are the type of people I look upto and think there's still hope. If people can beat opiate addiction then I think I too can bring myself and my life together for better.Yeah but how about without a filterGlow up �Congratulations!! Looks like you’re killing it!!! Sending so much positivity your way!I believe you have a doppelgänger running around ohio. Wow, you look amazing,congratulations! WowwwRighteous moo cow you look crazy good. Beautiful girl good for you ���Thanks. I think ima do the same thing as u when i get off suboxone. kratom is a really cool herb. u might wanna stock up on a lot of them tho to be safe, cuz who knows how long the government will let it stay legal. i know it’s stupid, but kratom doesn’t make them any money so it will probably become scheduled one day. Congrats. You look great. Great! So happy for you, looks like two completely different ladies. It is, of course. You're a beautiful person with a lot of life in front of you, may it be a beautiful future. Continued strength and focus to you!!!You’re are too young to trash your life away. Huge props. Keep it up, you look great. Damn girl.  You lookin cooler than the other side of the pillow.  Keep that shit up.[deleted]Omg you are so tiny! I'm jealous... I'm the same height as you. I'm a year clean and I gained like 15 pounds. I'm now 135 and I hate it. At my lowest in my addiction,  I was 105 and people said I looked horrible and disgusting because I was so thin. But I secretly loved it lol. ❤️ Good luck to you! Any secrets on losing the weight?? awesome awesome � one day at time girl, congrats�Congrats on making it this far. You look vibrant and happy. Like truly happy. Something about you gives off this “I’m a good person” vibe which is dope to see. I usually have a good eye for that. 

Rock on, and again, props. Keep doing what got you to right now. I'm not on Reddit often at all these days, but will look at my feed once in a while randomly.. this post makes me glad that I did!!! Currently in the thick of things but have been wanting to get out, & your post (and others like it) are so motivating & inspiring.. hopeful. It's so easy to fall into that negative thinking, that it can't be done, that everyone fails... It's inspiring to be reminded that that's not always how it goes & success IS possible! Fear is the main thing that keeps me stuck where I'm at, and seeing the difference in people who have made that leap really helps me to feel less afraid! I had 2 years at one point & it was the happiest I've ever been, you've reminded me of that! Thank you, & congratulations! Ur actually so hot in the pic on the left idk whyIsn’t funny how ya get hot once clean? I swear I made a full 180 in terms of looks. Once you start showering daily again and eating right it puts the life right back in ya?! Looking great! You are lovely!!! It looks like your soul is gone in the picture on the left. Some people say addiction steals souls and addicts are not happy. I beg to differ with that statement whereas each person handles their addiction or vices differently. I know many happy functioning addicts and I also know many miserable addicts. But the picture on the right you have a glow back in your eyes and that smile...wow!!! I don’t usually creep on people or comment on strangers pictures cause it’s sort of creepy in my eyes, but this is an exception! You just look so damn happy and full of life again!!! I hope you beat your eating disorder next, I have a cousin who suffers from body dysmorphia and hates the way she looks etc when in all reality she shouldn’t be ashamed of her looks (no creeps I’m not saying I think my cousin is hot!!!) however she is not ugly or need to be ashamed of her looks, and you TOTALLY should not be ashamed of your weight or looks either. You are beautiful and very well spoken from your posts! I hope you have found happiness other than at the bottom of a bottle or chasing your next fix....hopefully someday soon I can find happiness outside of pills and h congrats dude ! I'd bang em both.Your pupils arent pinned or anywhere near small in the old pic. You must not have been on opiates when that pic was taken.

Just somethin i noticed. Maybe thats the cause of the unhappy lookWhat's the dirtiest thing you've ever had to do for drug money?You look better hooked on smack, just sayin'diesbt seen kuje the same oersinDo they keep girls like you at na? I need to get out more! Congratulations on your sobriety, I too am sober and life is getting better.Are you really the same girl? When you was hooked, physically you still been so much pretty
:)  And first of all, congratulations in first place for 1 year sober, that is a really hard work. From junkie to preppie! Seriously though, you look great though keep up the good work!damn girl your looking really good!You look better in the first pic lol Idk I guess I'm biased cuz ur more my type in the first oneMan I always think the addicts are gorgeous, don't get me wrong I think you're looking a lot healthier but I always fall for the girls on the left.The one on the right is while on opiates, correct?Why do I like you more on the leftHaha sorry I know that’s fucked upNow this is what I call beautiful �❤Congratulations you look amazing You put on weight. Keep up the good work. Wanna make out?I’d make sober love to you babygirl ��Just about! Just hit 9 months clean today and 11 months sober from alcohol :)I couldn't be happier :) just gotta get my eating disorder under control and I'm golden ❤️Thank you!!❤️True.You're an inspiration and should be very proud of yourself! Stunning and the difference is astonishing. Less than a year! I respect the self-control and commitment to yourself to make things better. Looks like everything's coming up great. Never stop, never stopping! � Love these before and after pics, can see the life in people's eyes again. Sending positive vibes your way still, stay healthy girl!Thank you so so much!! Getting clean is one of the best things I've ever done❤️I'm 23 :)

Thank you!!!❤️is it a thing now that we call girls 'dude'? :DAmen❤️You've got this, I believe in you!

It's the same with any addiction, one turns into 100 and I refuse to go down that path ever again!

I'm so sorry to hear about your friend, I really hope they can get back on the right path❤️Yes! I got clean July 1,2018 :)It was crazy how quickly my color started to come back! 

Congrats on your year and a half, that's amazing! You're kicking ass!❤️It's like those before and after commercials. They look so miserable in the before photos. 

If they had the same facial expressions.. then that's the after I'd really wanna see 

AnywaysI haven't had a soul in years due to addiction, PTSD, and anorexia. I finally have my life back, I can finally smile and laugh and enjoy life! 

I do take Kratom to combat cravings and xanax for panic attacks (I have a full prescription from the beginning of February and it's one of the few drugs I DIDN'T abuse) but other than that, I'm free from the demons that were holding me back.

I'm so proud of you man, sobriety is so worth it❤️Meth is less cardio toxic than caffeine Pills, heroin, morphine.Thank you so much!!!❤️❤️You think I should post this on there as well?? I've never heard of that sub before!Thank you, love!!!❤️I take Kratom to help with cravings!
I also have a prescription for Xanax for panic attacks but I haven't touched it since I got it back at the beginning of February :)I could go for a cookie right now.That's a first! I typically get Penny from the big bang theory lolThank you so much!!!Thank you!!! :)Thank you so so so much!!!❤️

It feels so freeing and incredible! Words can't even begin to describe what it's like to be the person I am today compared to who I was a year ago. I smile and laugh without force, I don't have to hide behind a web of lies, my sight is clear.

I noticed the other day how beautiful the world actually is when it's not so blurry and unstable. I'm the happiest I've ever been and feel like I'm actually living after being dead for 10 years!Lol thank you!You're so kind, thank you so much!!!❤️ 

I still have down days, it's not all sunshine and Skittles, but I'm as happy as a clam 90% of the time ☺️There absolutely is, love❤️ it's hard but so so so worth it!To each their own☺️Hahaha how am I intimidating?! SameThank you so much!!❤️Thank you so much!!

It was pretty rough for a few months but now I'm feeling WONDERFUL! Congrats on 30 months, that's incredible!❤️I don't need white knights.

You're partially right, I did feel pressured to go to rehab and get better, but I didn't have friends swooping in to tell me to get help because I don't have any friends, I lost them all because of my addictions. Yes, my family pressured me to go to rehab but I'm the one who found the place and checked myself in and I stayed the entire time, even when I had the opportunities to leave early.

What I learned in rehab didn't stick because I wasn't ready to get better. I got clean on my own, for myself, because it's what I wanted. I was done with being miserable 24/7 and always looking for the next fix. I was tired for wanting to die all the time. I was ready to give up that life for a better one. 

I got clean 11 months after I got out of rehab and it had nothing to do with what other people were telling me to do. It was for me.Do you need a hug? I'm a great hugger!I certainly can be!Thank you so much!!

I get really excited when I get notifications :) I don't have many friends so when I have people to talk to, even if it's just a simple response, I get really happy!�Thank you so so so much! This comment made me smile like crazy!❤️ This is my favorite sub, I love how loving everyone is! I'll definitely be posting something when I hit my one year sober mark❤️I believe in you!! If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm a great listener! :)
And thank you so so much!!Thank you so much!!! ❤️Stay strong!❤️Thank you, I am as well!! :)Thank you so much! It is a sobriety post lolWhy thank you!You're so strong for pulling yourself back out of your relapse, that's one of the hardest things to do! I don't know you but I'm so beyond proud of you for getting your life back❤️

Have you ever tried taking Kratom? It's the reason I've been able to stay on track and also kick cigarettes and alcohol as well as drugs!

It's like we get a second chance at life!❤️ Again, I'm so proud of you, love! That's so awesome!!! Keep up the good work, congrats!!!❤️❤️❤️I'm 23!I lived in Connecticut for a little while but I'm a born and raised North Carolinian❤️People have said that and I have no idea who she is! I hope that's a good thing!
And I've been to rehab :) ???There were many reasons but the main one... I fell in love. I knew if I kept using, I'd lose him. So I quit the day of our first date and I've never looked back :)Yes but it wasn't all because of opioids! My sex life (up until now) was horrid and it ruined sex for me until I met my current bf.

I've noticed that Kratom doesn't really affect my libido but it does dull my senses.Thank you, Jeff!!!❤️A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

I'm a substitute high school teacher, finishing up college, quit smoking, it's all finally coming together ❤️There can be only oneThank you so much!!❤️❤️☺️� moo! 

Thank you!❤️Oh I know and I live in NC so there's just not telling what's gonna happen but I have a very reliable supplier who said he'd make sure I get my stuff even if it becomes scheduled :)Thank you so much!!! ☺️Thank you so so so much!!! You're so sweet!!❤️Addiction and anorexia have stolen over a decade of my life, I refuse to let them take any more!

Thank you so much!❤️Hahaha thank you so so much!!!❤️❤️Thank you so much!! It's all in my past and I'm never going back!❤️Trust me, you want to stay at the weight you're at because I'm sure you're gorgeous! I've suffered from anorexia for over a decade now and it's gotten REALLY bad since getting clean (gotta trade one vice for another, right? Haha). I'm trying to get my weight up because my body looks AWFUL (even though I secretly like it) and I'm so afraid my heart is gonna give out. Please don't go down this path, you beautiful soul❤️❤️Thank you so much!!!❤️Thank you so so so much, that means so much to me!❤️

I try to be the best person I can be to others, everyone deserves kindness even if you don't receive it in return! 

Your comment really made me smile ☺️Thank you so much!!I had more drugs in me than a pharmacy but I couldn't tell you what I was on when I took that pic. It was taken after my ex threatened to punch me in the face for drinking a glass of wine.Oh please. Quit with that shit. I’ve been using opiates for almost a decade and my pupils always look the same, opiates or not. Unless I take MDMA. Not everyone is the same and it’s ridiculous to think you can tell whether this girl was or wasn’t on opiates from her pupils alone.Cleaning the women's restrooms at the restaurants I worked at. God that was awful. Wow, what a shitty comment, just looking for some material to fuel your fantasies?  Why would you think this is at all an appropriate question to ask? [deleted]We all have our preferences!I'm not sure, I never really went to meetings! I thought they were quite boring lolHaha yes I really am the same girl! Just more lively!
And thank you so much :)Thank you so much!!!

I'm definitely far from preppy but I HAVE stepped up my style game slightly! Although, I say this as I'm playing video games in giant sweatpants and an XXL sweatshirt so... Maybe not �Thank you so much!!! ☺️☺️Lol you're not the first person who has said thatThe one on the left :/Personal preference, I suppose Not at all, we all have things that we prefer, that doesn't mean it's fucked up! Well, within reason hahaYou're so sweet, thank you so much!!!❤️❤️❤️☺️I lost weight actually.The fuck?Congrats on your personal 9/11!You don’t even look like the same person lol. Keep it up!Proud of you but the girl on the left is my current type.. I have a problem with being attracted to girls with drug problems.. lollllYou should be so proud of yourself. I know I am!Idk you but im proud! Longest ive gone sober since i started in 2010 was 7 months �. You’re golden anyways. Ppl always focus on the bad. You’re the champ — keep it up. You’re worth 10000000000x more than the drugs/booze. Always remember that.Ohh. Just saw this comment. Yeah. I bought 108 was very underweight... Please take care of and learn to love yourself, hun. �Your smile shows that! I wish you the very best, don't ever go back. It is a dark void that will steal your soul. It's taken me 20+ years to figure that one out! 

Live, Laugh, Love!Man that’s so young to be struggling with addictions � anyways, your looking good and you have a wicked future ahead of you hopefully � all the best bro ���I call all people dude or bro I guess, unless I know your name �‍♂️ nothing bad meant by it, but we are all the same in this gameOMG my clean date is July, 22nd 2018 <3 im right behind uCongrats! I got clean for a and a half. Had a relapse two months ago but better now. Ik smoking bud is a drug but i dont crave it like im a big pill head. Not into dope or speed or any thing. �  but good for u!Yeah it really is! Like along with color and some weight, one goes from looking like the living dead to actually looking human. Keep it up you're doing amazingly! 
& thank you :') <3I have bipolar type 2 with mixed episodes of psychosis, but I always know I'm in psychosis when it happens. Word up. My family's starting to be chill with me again but that took months, I'm not currently "employed employed" but I do legal odd-jobs. Addiction is the one thing I've found that logic doesn't work against. I was thinking that the only way to beat the game is to stop playing, in regards to this. Goddamn I'm stoned lol.I meant to say it was neurotoxic, not cardiotoxic. 

Hashtag high posting lolAnd your ROC? Sorry, I'm just curious because your story is remarkably similar to mine. I was just kidding; play on words for a less than savory sub of similar name.   Grats on the clean time btw; it's hard but also very worthwhile, I know.You’re truly gorgeous, I mean it. I’m glad you were able to beat the disease of addiction. Remember to stay vigilant and don’t get too comfortable, that shit is waiting for you to slip up and it’ll grab you and try to pull you right back at the first chance it gets. You have more time than I do so it’s nothing you don’t know already, but it also can’t hurt to hear it again. 

If you ever need someone to talk to for support on a bad day PM me and I’ll help you out. 

Keep pushing forward! We can only go up from here now that the worst part is behind us!!! (:oh wow that’s really good about the xanax. i can’t say that i would be as strong as u with that. lol. but it’s definitely something i respect.  i’ve tried kratom before. it actually worked pretty well when i had a lower tolerance. it was like a mixture of vicodin and caffeine but not very strong. it always gave me these weird herbal tasting burps tho. lol

anyways, i’m glad to hear ur doing well. it’s always nice to know that success is attainable. keep it up![deleted]Yeah ; i feel ya, Ive been 3 months sober and reality its life ; its like taking off that bandage off and watching for how it is ; feeling it for how it feels, life is a rollercoaster of emotions a lot of people don’t wanna deal with ; thats why drugs give em their escape im just happy you’re strong enough to feel the air again; to breathe and walk ; eat and talk without a buzz , yeah it can be harsh sometimes but it couldn’t be light without darkness right �� you woke up and i bet theres no one more happy than the inner you ; now keep the process of learning how to live with emotions ; with feelings; ups and downs ; but damn you made it out  alive and not a zombie anymore ✌���‍♀️ charge that spirit , good vibes ✨ i wish you the best you deserve it , i think everyone who’s been throu hell deserves a lil piece of peace ✌� LolIf guess he feels you are too good looking and therefore "out of his league".You're very welcome! You equated the relationships with your loved ones to be of greater importance than your addictions. Which is good, that means you're not a psychopath. Most addicts come to that same conclusion. 

But the thing is, its fucking annoying that people are so reactive to substance abuse to the point where they believe they need to step in. Because the ultimatum always comes to "it's either me or the drugs"

The culture has made that ultimatum the end game 9/10 when the reality is drug abuse and relationships are two mutually exclusive things. People should respect peoples right to use drugs and let them fight their own battles. But fighting battles alone is impossible so the threat of losing people is enough to force complete submission and allow others to "help"I really hate saying what I'm saying because I know its toxic and encourages relapse. I just know it's the truth behind addiction. But still, from the bottom of my heart I congratulate you on your sobriety. And I hope you keep it up. But It really saddens me when I see people holding a gentle sobriety on the facades others build for them. And it makes me prefer the misery of addiction 

Even though deep down I know theres a real life outside of addictionis that not what ur doing here urself lol Girl, a hug wouldn't come close to curing the depths of my spiritual malady. Thanks for the offer though.Put yourself out there bc with all the real stuff that I'm sure you've had to go through, you'll find friends in no time. Plus that smile will definitely attract other interesting people. Happy days ahead ��. Please be sure to let us know when it's officially your 1st year, you got this! No problem and thank you, that's very kind of you. I'm not much of a talker, I wouldn't call myself shy but more... closed off I guess. I do appreciate the offer though and if I ever do need to talk, I'll remember this comment. Congrats again on the sobriety.thanks :) i’ve never really tried kratom...just use minimal benzo/lope/weed for acute wd. 

This was just a few weeks of an oxy binge so i’m feeling wd, but not awful by any means. My blessing and curse is that no one really cares where or when i do my work so long as i produce...gets me in trouble. 

What made you decide to give up alcohol as well? I don’t think I could ever because of all the social stuff for work, but it’s never been my issue. It's a good thing :), she is very young, and talented singer. Check her out on YouTube. When the Party's over, or Bury a Friend etc... :) And I didn't mean you should go to rehab, I assumed you did ;). Was trying to tell the others out there that may read this :)[deleted]Maybe that was a backwards compliment. You shouldn’t hide your improvement with a filter, it’s disingenuous to your hard work. Be you, filterless, editless. �Might be your evil tethered twin 

(This won’t make any sense unless you’ve seen US)Of course! Very proud of your sobriety! ok well that’s good. I hope u continue to do good. and hit me up on here if u ever find urself feeling week and needing some help. i don’t mind. It is sort of odd to say/see, but the eyes are one of the biggest differences.  In the "clean" photo you actually look like you have life in your eyes, the "dope" photo you almost look dead-eyed.  I mean that as a compliment, while I realize the whole "dead eye" thing probably sounds more like an insult.You’re welcome. I love your attitude and the change in the pic reminds me of when I got clean. I was 6’2” like 165 when I went to rehab. I thought I looked fine, but I looked like an addict that never ate. Just wanted to show some support. 

And like I said don’t stop doing whatever got you this far. I eased up after a year thinking I was good and went on a ten day bender before finally getting it to stick. Good luck. You got someone rooting for ya in Texas. I was specifically talking about opiates with the pupil size. You coulda been on every other drug in the book and ur pupils wouldnt have been tiny (except for antipsychotics like seroquel. They also constrict pupils)

Meant no disrespect even tho that's what people always jump to. Even tho idk how me simply saying ur pupils werent tiny would be offensive.Its a known fact 100% that when you use opiates your pupils get tiny. Unless maybe youre doin meth or coke which make pupils huge.

I didn't mean any hate, i thought i clearly said im not sayin negative shit.  When i see a old pic of when someone was using ill check if their pupils are pinned.

Or if i run into an old using buddy i usually just glance n see if their still using or not by tiny pupils.

If i see an old picture of myself in the past 10 years ill try n see how my pupils look. Idk what all the freak outs are from.This is the internet.

People who think they can tell others what to do and how to think with the word "appropriate" are the biggest assholes out there.

Yes, I was looking for a good story.

If you don't like it, then fuck you.My ex was a cheerleader at an ACC school, 2/10 white knight harder.I can see you in your eyes :) Awwwe please don't think you're not beautiful clean because you 100% are I'm just a weird one. Now there'll be more than just scrawny white dudes with problems hitting on you! Congrats on 9 months though! Just picked up my 6No mam, you are the one who's sweet now. Are you clean now? Like never even feel like doing it again?Well you look chubby. Like just look at your face compared to the older photo?Just some super thirsty dude I'd guess.Hahaha why thank you!It was an inside job!This comment is ���Lol I like to think that's a good thing! You should've seen my face when I was drinking all the time... My cheeks were HUGE. I was 140lbs at the point, 122lbs in the pic on the left and I'm now 108lbs!I really am :)

Thank you so much!!!7 months is a helluva an accomplishment! You should be proud too!Thank you so much, love, that means so much to me!!!❤️❤️❤️Keep fighting, it's all so worth it! It took almost a decade of my life, I refuse to let it take any more of it!I started young but I got out young, I still have my whole life ahead of me❤️
Thank you so much, man, you have no idea how much your kind words mean to me!Yeah I'm 23 and going to rehab today for my 3rd time. 
Congrats OP! Nobody likes you when your 23 :(Well im 18 and addicted to oxyare you implying it becomes better for you/ easier when your older? �Congrats, dude! That's so awesome!❤️❤️Lol hey, whatever pays the bills, right?? I'm basically just a glorified babysitter that makes barely enough to get by (and I live with my dad, so that's saying something) but it gives me purpose and I love it! 

My family and I are finally on good terms, for the most part. they're still not happy with my eating disorder coming back but that's just another demon I'm gonna defeat!

Addiction is hell but you can pull yourself out, you just have to find that strength within yourself. People can help but you have to be the one who wants to be free❤️I'm so sorry, what does ROC mean?? What does the "C" stand for if it's "route of administration"? I've seen the acronym a lot and knew what it meant from context, but never known what it actually stood for.ROC? lolAhhh yes, I am very familiar with the Kratom burps lol, they're not fun! But it's the one thing that has worked EXTREMELY well for me! It even helped me quit smoking cigarettes! 

Success is absolutely attainable! You got this❤️I didn't ask you to care about me or give me attention but thank you for doing both by leaving a response �Don't hold back on my account, my sobriety is pretty damn solid.

You're right, a lot of people do submit to sobriety to preserve their relationships and that's when sobriety just doesn't work out. But that's not the case with my situation. 

Fighting addiction alone isn't impossible. It's not easy and it's not as effective, but it isn't impossible. You need to save yourself to actually get better, you can't wait for a "white knights", as you said, to come in and save the day. I really hate you feel that way and I truly hope you can find some light in your life to show you that sobriety is actually wonderful if you embrace it. 

I've been an addict for years so I know the truth behind addiction as well. I've relapsed more times than I can count. But this time is different. When you know, you know.

If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you. Again, I really hope you find hope, addiction is a dark and lonely place.No problem! I'll send a batch of cookies instead!❤️Trust me, I'm gonna make a huge deal out of it lol

Thank you so much for your kind words❤️❤️If you ever feel like the withdrawals or even the cravings are too much, I suggest trying Kratom. It really is a life saver! I don't think I could've gotten through WDs without it!

I can understand that. Idle hands are the devil's play thing, you know? But the fact that you're getting out of it on your own is HUGE! 

Along with being an addict, I was a huge alcoholic. If I couldn't afford drugs, I'd buy alcohol and get black out drunk (I've been to the hospital more times for alcohol than drugs) because I didn't want to be alive anymore. I quit drinking first mainly because my dad said it was either quit drinking or move out. Then quit drugs because I fell in love.Thank you!! I'll check her out as soon as I get out of work!❤️Ohh wow I'm a ding dong, I'm sorry!!

I completely agree! I went on my own, I wasn't forced, and it's the best thing I could've done for myself❤️ well, most of it. I did end up making a 6 month long mistake but I fixed that lolAhhh I hate to disappoint but I was just a waitress!All I can picture is Gemini from Binding of Isaac �Thank you so much, I really appreciate that! :)It's not an insult at all, it's true! Most of my pictures from before I got clean are hard to look at because I had zero life behind my eyes and they were just so dull.I'm so proud of you for getting clean! It's one of the hardest, most rewarding things ever❤️ your comments are so sweet and uplifting, thank you so much!!

You've got someone rooting for ya in NC❤️I didn't take it offensively at all! :)I'm a heroin user, my pupils usually only get pinned when I take a LOT. At my average level of high-ness - they're normal size. You have a weird personal definition of “known fact”.I never told what you could or couldn't think or do. I just stated my opinion, that it was a shitty question to ask, and pretty damn sleazy.

If you don't like it fuck you too! ;)[deleted]This made me smile :)I didn't take any offense at all! Everybody has their own preferences, who am I to judge? :)Congrats, love, that's great! Keep it up! ☺️I am 100% clean but there are definitely times where I get cravings to use again, especially when things seem to be falling apart, but I stay strong :)Thank you, I appreciate that!FIRE CANT MELT STEEL BEAMS!Outside jobHow tall are you? Np, it’s true. Keep it up, you got this!!!We're on the same boat. I started young (around 16) and i am almost completing 2 months sober (at 23 too). Shit's rough but we can do it! I dont mean to sound negative but don't go in with the mindset that you "got out". I was clean for 4 years and I started using again. I use to think this too, I started when I was 19, got clean at 20 and was clean until 24. It will be a part of you forever, even if you don't want it to be. Keep trying! You got this! You're gonna do great, dude! I know it's scary as hell but, trust me, it's so worth it!❤️Rehab doesn't work but take it slow on your next relapse 19 recovering from heroin here damn arent them pills like 35 a pop nowadays?Not implying anything. Just chatting to the young lady. Fuck off elsewhere if your trying to cause an argument ��That seems like a pretty cool gig. Ngl I had a free couple fat hits off the foil with bth a couple weeks ago for free and I did some fent last week so my long ass 289  clean streak is broken. I'm not too bothered, what's weird I still I really like opiates but they don't hit hard enough anymore unless I IV and that's risky business.Route of administration. So, did you snort, smoke or shoot your heroin? It was a typo. I meant ROALook into Beano (just get the large bottle walmart equivilant) it's a enyzme that helps break down what your body has trouble processing. For me it wasn't just kratom burps but full on kratom farts that were beyond awful.[deleted]It's good you were able to find a genuine comfort in loved ones over addiction. I know it takes constant work and that takes a lot of strength. It doesnt change the status quo, though and this culture is causing addiction to be as life threatening as it isWell good for you :) Luckily I’m not around a lot of supply so my main trigger is when it’s in front of my face, which is rare. 

Hope you’re enjoying your freedom. All good, congrats again, and keep it up. You're doing great, and look amazing!no problem. it’s not easy being an addict. it’s just good to know ur not alone in the world. You’re welcome! And I didn’t think it was possible, but after about 7-8 years I realized I had completely lost the temptation to use. I’ve been offered pills at work so many times, and I’ve had a bottle of codeine just chillin for over a year. Opiates don’t cross my mind unless I’m clicking on this sub. 

I find this sub helps me remember how bad it used to be. Be good out there, miss NC. Bro theres nothing to argue about. This is medically known for 100 years. Opiates cause pupil retention.  Then when you get about 18-24+hours sick your pupils get huge.

If your pupils arent pinned then your just not taking what your tolerance requires to get analgesic effects.

If i do 100mg per dose to get high, then i take 20mg, thats just not enough to account for the tolerance.What is that supposed to mean?  Do you also believe the earth is flat too? All opiates cause pupil constriction broYou just over here wishing you could get a girl under 200 lbs lmao

https://imgur.com/a/Ugc40usIt's a pitty that I can't saw it :) The fear was that I'd be interpreted as the judge, you the jury and the rest of this subreddit my executioner, downvoting me for my tastes. So you are my savior u/xpoloroidx, thank you.Oh yes, that's great. I never did drugs. Not even once. I wanted to do that but when I see people falling apart, I just back out and think about something else.How do you feel when you get cravings?? I hope I am not asking too muchYou look cuter in the first picture, maybe you should go back to opiates. *JET FUEL can’t melt steel beams.Actually it would be an inside job till the explosion then it would be an outside job5'5.5-5'6"! We got this! I'm so proud of you, 2 months is an amazing accomplishment❤️❤️[deleted]FOH.Honestly go fuck yourself, you’re no better than anyone else. 

/u/sausageturtle330 Don’t listen to this fuckboy. Get all you can out of it this time around and stay focused, maybe this time will be your last. Once you’re over the physical withdrawals, use that pain you felt as motivation to never feel that way again (assuming you’re detoxing from opiates). You don’t have to live the lifestyle that accompanies an opiate addiction anymore, it’s truly no way to live. If you need someone to talk to PM me. Take it one day at a time and you got this. Get it now while you’re young, we have the advantage over the old heads that have been drinking and drugging longer than we’ve been alive. 27, addicted to fent-dope (scramble) 5 gram a day habit20 addicted to IV meth/fentanyl late to the party but 19 addicted to oxy + fent. No such thing as starting too young.I buy 20mg for an equivalent of 0.6 dollars but im from czechiahahaha i was just joking, but jeez   your defensiveness  is real i didnt realize  you were a thuuursty ass nigga, i love when people expose thenselves for no reason whatsoever � 
anyways i wasnt looking for and argument  but you clearly are so ill just nip it in the bud. im sorry you were offended  by my joke thay had nothing to do with you,  i wish you the best , good day my friend.We all have slip ups, my man! It's not a relapse until you let it be. Just focus on the positives and see how far you've come. One slip up doesn't diminish all the progress you've made!Mainly shot and snorted, never smoked!Maybe that's why I'm so freaking bloated all the time... I'm definitely gonna look into that! I'm actually going to Walmart tonight so it's perfect timing! Thank you so much!!Three comments, that must meant you care A LOT!Thank you so so so so much!!❤️I'm not arguing the fact that yes, in general taking opiates makes your eyes pinned, but the point is that you can be an active opiate addict (and not in withdrawals) without your pupils being pinned 24/7. I've had enough today to stave off WD's and my pupils are just about normal size.   


To the OP: well done on getting clean. It's fucking hard and you look great now. [deleted]I figured as much :) don't worry, I'll even upvote you just in case!Not at all, I'm an open book!

I feel like I want to claw myself out of my skin, I can't think straight, my anxiety goes through the roof. I either get very frustrated or silent, depending on who I'm around. Sometimes I cry.

It's not easy, it doesn't come and go. When it hits, it stays for a while. But I push through and keep reminding myself of why I got clean and what I've accomplished since but also of what I could lose if I ever go back. Going back, even for a moment, will never be worth all that I'd lose.Absolutely, I'll get right on that.108 at 5’6”? That’s *fairly* underweight, sweetie... And your cheeks look fuller and more plump in your long-term sobriety photo, in all honesty... I’m glad you lost some of the weight you put on from drinking, but 122 is likely closer to an ideal, HEALTHY weight (body mass index) for your height. 
I’m just looking out - you need to keep your HEALTH as your first priority. At all times."First time" you're just proving my point. 1.6 years clean I just railed half a 30mg roxy and I feel fucking amazing.Yo why is everybody so fucking salty. Statistically we're all going to relapse a bunch of fucking times before we get clean. And its more likely you're going to have a life threatening OD when your tolerance is low. Trying to save lives here bro, sounds like your just regurgitating useless words of encouragement.holy sweet flying fuck! they are a dollar a fucking milligram here in america!Bit late but sorry dude. I was having a bad day ���Thanks for the words of encouragement and your perspective �As I said, your story is strangely similar to mine. I'm also a teacher, I'm 23, female. I started with pills as well, but tramadol instead. We don't get much oxy/hydro in the UK. sit on my face You literally just repeated what i said bro. 

If ur only barely taking enough to stave off wds, then you're NOT HIGH on opiates.

The whole comment was about the pupils being normal size which means she wasnt high on opiates in the picture.

Why are you still arguing about this petty bullshit?  Youre acting like a childBruh, you're homeless and beg people on reddit for money, the only action you've gotten in the last year is the time that crusty old homeless dude took advantage of you beneath that bridge you sleep under �Thank you for that
And I am really sorry that you have to go through this all. How often you feel this way?I'm just kidding love, you look healthy. 
Congrats. Yea, my anorexia came back full force once I got clean, unfortunately!

What's funny is, no matter how much weight I lose, I always have chubby cheeks when I smile �[deleted]Someone going into rehab needs words of encouragement. If you have the mindset that you’re going to relapse you’re obviously going to relapse. Relapse doesn’t have to be part of recovery. It usually is, but it doesn’t have to be. There was no need to be so negative, that’s not helping anyone. And it’s quite obvious you weren’t trying to save anyone’s life, you were just making a snarky comment that no one was having. They might be useless to you, but maybe he’ll get it this time, you have no idea if he will or he won’t. You’re just assuming he’s going to fail. You need to help raise people up when they’re down, not push them back down. Who cares about statistics.. honestly, if you want it bad enough you’re going to stay clean.nw hope ur all good fam, peace and love!Wow that's crazy!
I started with oxy and then basically took whatever I could once I spiraled. 
I'm in the US :)Are you clean now?You should play Dragon Age, you seem to be quite bored.Bit oversensitive aren't we? You're the one who took a good-natured comment and decided to take it as a personal attack and turn it into an argument �

Stating one's point of view is not arguing, and you don't need to have the last word on everything. It doesn't matter. Grow up. [deleted]Of course, love! And don't apologize, we all go through our battles, this is mine!

It's become more often recently, unfortunately. When I got clean, my eating disorder came back full force (cuz I just can't let myself be healthy and happy lol) and it's been causing a LOT of tension between me and the people in my life. Before I got clean, my way of coping with stress/anxiety was to use but now I don't have any vices, I even quit smoking cigarettes back in January. I'm having to relearn (healthy) coping mechanisms all while trying to get my weight back on track (I just keep losing more) and it's just... Tough. But I'll win this battle, too. I may be physically weak but I'm strong in many other ways.You're entitled to your own opinions, who am I to judge? 

But thank you, I appreciate itI’m sorry to hear that, sweetie. I’m going through something similar currently... I won’t divulge too many personal details, but you’re welcome to message me anytime regarding this, hun. ���

I also have that same problem, as well. When my now-fiancé first met me, some fat chick who liked him got hella jealous he has always ignored her and - in her mind - to top it all off, now he had a girlfriend! He posted a photo of us together at a huge music festival on one of our first dates. The photo was just us from the shoulders up, and my cheeks are really round. My dude calls me his “lil chipmunk” sometimes when he pinches my cheeks! � 
Anyways: this fat, crazy chick - who he wasn’t even dating or talking to, SHE simply wanted to fuck HIM, and that was the totality of the ‘relationship’ - had the goddamn balls to message him saying his “new girlfriend was FAT!” When, in reality, I was 135 pounds at the time, and she was over 200...Exactly. How long you been sober? who paid for your rehab?And you brother take it easy �I also have an eating disorder. Diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12. And I kind of recovered for a bit when I was 17, then slipped back into it when I was 20.No, definitely not. I'm going to order some kratom soon and maybe taper with that to get off the kit. only if we play togetherOk. Sure thing kiddo.  Obviously if you take minute amounts that isnt enough to effect you that you wont get pinned pupils.

If i drink a quarter of a can of beer then im still not drunk. Or if an alcoholic that drinks 30 beers per day, only drinks 3 beers one day, hes still not drunk even though a non drinker would be affected by 3 beers.

My original comment said that her pupils werent small in the old picture which means she WASNT HIGH ON OPIATES IN THE PICTURE.  What is the point of your peanut gallery comments? Dont you have to wake up for school in the morning? Go to bed already and quit the ignorant commentsOh now were getting all serious no more ��� emojis, im sowwy I hurt your feelings.Finally!! This is what I wanted to hear. No matter how bad the situation is, you just dont give up! That's so great and I am so glad that I could talk to you about this.  Just imagine the picture of the people when you get cravings, I am not sure but I think this will go away. You'll become healthy soon. You are pretty and you'll do great in your life. Someone said it to me "its okay to cheat as long as you don't make it a habit" I think you can sometimes smoke cigarettes or drink a little bit as long as it's just for fun. Btw what's eating disorder? And is it okay that we are talking all this in comments? I mean I could text you if it's okayMy only real opinion is that you look more healthier. Woowwww what a bitch, that's awful! I'm so sorry she did that! Bitches be crazy sometimes...

My boyfriend calls me Noodle lol

You're welcome me to message me anytime you want, as well! I'm an open book❤️

I hope things are going well for you now!Holy shit... My eating disorder started at like 10/11, I was diagnosed at 12, went to treatment 4 days before my 17th birthday, left 4 months later, and was fine until about 20. It started back up but was overshadowed by drugs and alcohol but has really picked up since getting clean. Are we the same person?Can you let me know a decent UK place for kratom? I’ve never found any reasonably priced uk stuff before.  Feel free to message me if you want to talk regarding recovery, I’m uk based and recent got clean myself, trying to keep straight and narrow. Absolutely.You really need to chill, dude. I don't know where you got the impression that my comment was somehow directed with hostility towards you, but it wasn't. I was just adding my two cents, because in your original comment it sounded a bit like you were saying that she was not using at all at the time the photo was taken.

Seriously, what's with the aggression? [deleted]There are definitely some people who CAN cheat but I'm not one of those people. I won't even let myself try because I don't want to risk all of my hard work :)

Anorexia, basically I starve myself so I can be as thin as possible.Thank you so much, love, that means a lot! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I always said, “Man, I could have a nice car with all the money I spend on my habit.” Now, a year clean., Content: , ups: 1034, downs: 0congrats dawg, looks clean as hell. Please call it your soberu. Please. 2015 WRXYooo, that’s clean my guy! This is motivating, thanks! Cool *and yet* still slightly sensible!! Good call OP
Congrats!Beautiful car and nice job staying sober man! Ya I like it.  Nice ride!One day I will sieze this victory! Congrats OPFuk yeah bro....now the dope man see you in a nice whip shooting the middle up as you pass[deleted]Sick whip dawg lol #jealous lol !��Was looking at the exact same car to get as my DD/Commuter..identical to yours.

Subie Bros! (Kinda, my girl drives a 2010 legacy)

Love her car in the snow, awd donuts are fun as fuck. Even though hers is the 2.5 you can get it to slide through corners on dirt roads no probif someone is in recovery and they don’t drive a subi, are they really even in recovery?

jokes aside, congratulations dude! i’m proud of you!schwet!Awesome. I got a car too...but it’s not picture worthy, only a 08 Prius

But boy I wish I had it when I was using cause it only takes like 17$ to fill it up and get 300-350 per full tankHell yeah, it’s crazy knowing I would spend like a car note on dope every day. The amount of shit you can afford when you’re clean is such a wonderful positive reinforcement.Way to go man! No bs. That's not an easy hurdle bro. That's so awesome! I say the same shit these days and decided today that I'm serious about kicking my habit. This post came at a great time, truly an inspiration, congrats!!Even if I gave up the habit. Which I have for now but its been on and off for a couple years now... I don't think I could afford this. :/ 
What do you do if you don't mind me asking ?
And how long did it take you to save up for it ? This is the kind of post I love to see!!! Apart from all the H and 30's but a fuck up story changed around! I'm trying to overcome all my addictions and get myself a Subaru! My dream Car man, Congrats ! YOU DESERVE ITBut also, if you are clean, isn't it kind of a bad idea to be lurking the opiates subreddit?

  
But in the back of your mind....maybe? Congrats bro!What is that, a Prius?now doesn't that feel so much better than a bundle of dope thats only gonna make you feel ok for a few hours or days... enjoy it man you EARNED that car!!!

Fuck yeah that's awesome. Congrats dude Well we have three or four, but still... not trying to deal with service issues on a new car. HahaCongrats! This is actually the car I’ve been slowly saving for, I make a good amount of money for my age I’m 20 and a area manager at a retail store so the pay is pretty good considering every manger in that store is 30+ so I know I can do this as well I just have to put in the hard work and dedication to stop my habit, 2019 will be my year (,:Hell yeah think of all the escorts you can fuck in thereI don't see  a nice car, only a Subaru??Gtfo with that positive shit.

You should install a Cobb access port �  Nice dude! Plan on doing any mods or tracking it? 


My man and I have a 07 Nissan 350z and ‘14 Scion FR-S; theyre our babies, I hope we can get clean so we can go back to modding our cars agains. 19 STI! These are fucking amazing cars ♡ 
http://imgur.com/a/m4HZLkfBeautiful carThis is extremely motivating. I am so sick of the chase, but so petrified of standing still. It seems a bit moronic that I tell myself I can't do it or don't have time because i have to be a mom. I can't take time for recovery because my kids would be without me. But, they are anyway even if I am present because I am not so comfortably numb anymore. I am more just surviving. They deserve more. Thank you for sharing your success, keep it up. I help lots of people stay clean and get help, but can't seem to help myself. These posts keep me motivated to do better Read the follow up post, fucktard If 951 has to do with the Porsche, you have good taste in cars. For that price, I'd get an older STI. Yes sir!Thanks!Haha. Thanks!Curious what a "car note a day" is? What was your daily habit costing at its worst if you don't me asking. Or what's the worst you've heard of. I think a lot of ppl in here hope to be clean one day...lol...I'm here, but started methadone almost 2 months ago....Yes. Sometimes. But in an odd way, it gives me my fill, or ill read about how sick someone is and I instantly go back to when I couldn’t get out of bed and cold sweats and shit. No thank you. Haha.Lol. Always.Haha funny guy[deleted]Get an older one. They're still dope. How much do you think you've spent total? Don't have a dope habit but beat a GHB addiction but that was relatively cheap. I'm always curious what peoples daily habit costs.Sorry bud, I’m loyal to only one escort. And she stay mounted on the dash on the lookout for 5-0. Lolahhhhh, the smell of a warm random shitpost that everyone will glance over...Sheesh guy.  I hope your plug comes through soon so you can relax.Auids are  are for peole like  you who are into schieza  porn and genocide. 
Subi gang!
GANG GANG! 
P.S this subi will %100 smoke ur little 1.8L 2003 A4 so calm ur tiny nuts.0ii6%=I own an 08, COBB stage 1. :) I plan on it.  Trying to still figure out what I want to do with it.  Exhaust, body kit, etc.Thanks!  Still trying to decide.  Probably the Cobb and exhaust.  Nice!! I like the STI[deleted]I think you should look at it the other way, you want to get clean *for* your kids. Don't use the short term pain/necessity of withdrawal as a reason why you can't do it. You can do it! and your kids will be proud as hell.I'm a mom too...I started methadone almost 2 months ago...I get what you're saying about feeling numb, and the guilt that goes with being a mom and an addict....Thank you for the kind words.  I’ll save the cliche words because you know them already.  You have to have a made up mind about it.  Part of the way I found success was because of my ego.  I always told myself that I had my habit in check, and I could go without if I wanted to, and by the time I looked up I was in a place where I was definitely not able to do that.  So I made up my mind, I’m not doing this anymore.  
Here’s a tip I will share.  Don’t bog yourself down with thinking about what you will do for the rest of your life, think about the next five minutes, then the next five, then the next day and work on controlling those, and you’ll be on a good path.  I used to scare myself back into it because I felt that there was no way I could live the rest of life sober.  Well you don’t have to, and you don’t have to think that way.  Find a little substitute, weed worked for me, and get going.  And before you tell me weed no longer gets you high, don’t. Haha.  Eat an edible, hit a gravity bong, get some CBD (you can order that online), and get going.  It’s too easy to get weed these days.  And trust me, I used to say weed didn’t do it for me anymore either, but that’s your opiate brain telling you it’s no good, I promise, when you’re sick...some weed will be your saving grace.  And it’s the thing that helps keep me in line.  Without it, (if I were trying to live the rest of my life sober), I would have fallen all the way back down to where I was.  Instead, I may want it some, then I just come home do a couple bong rips and it’s over with.  [deleted]Oh god no. Older means modded, no bueno. I was looking at a Focus ST as well but the R Golf was really fast. I was thinking of another M3 but I have an M5 and X6M already.Car bill a day maybe?Oh I’ve spent upwards of 300-400 a day. I imagine it’s worse for those with the means But that IS a badass automotive bro. I'm excited about this because I have nothing to show for my failures into rehabilitation.

INSPIRATIONAL YOUAt that high of a monthly payment he's definitely not putting a lot down or it's something he shouldn't be financing.i was just browsing, no way im gonna put almost 1k a month payment on a truck that wont hold its value over time, unless its a ford raptor (they hold nearly 90% of their value according to doug demuro/auto trader)

but i really love luxury trucks.... probably gonna go with an F150 with all the best options

and actually i was wrong, F150 platinum STARTS at 504$/month i thought it was much higher.... so probably would be close to 900 all together with insurance, after upgrades. Heroin addicts typically spend between $40-$200, sometimes less or more but that range covers most heroin users I'd say. The range being light to heavy use.

But prices differ based on tooooons of variables.I've been an addict for several years...and my addiction has gone up and down...but on average, I would day that I spent around $2500-$3000 per month on pills the past 2 years....it was a little lower than that over 2 years ago, but with tolerance and prices always increasing,  that's where I was at when I started methadone....so, in all....I'd say I've spent $70,000-$100000 on pills during the last 8 years. Makes me so sick to think of. I could have paid of my college loans with that![deleted]Id have went with an EV of any sort! Renewable energy all the way!    But congrats on your year clean.[deleted][deleted]It feels bad because I feel I don't have the right to stand still. I wish it were that simple. I want to be well for my kids. I am in hospice and moved, losing my care. No one will take me on as a patient in the place I moved. So, I am in forced withdrawal and can't drive the distance to see my prior hospice doctor. It was supposed to be all set up. These are the issues that go on in the world as all are well aware of, thus the steady increase in heroin use among patients and subsequent deaths as most of us have had no experience in it. I want to be present foe my kids without the unspeakable pain of the disease other than the dependence these meds put me into. I want to find something natural to help the pain my last time here with them, but i have tried most things. I want weed. I can't get it here. It carries the same jail time as any hard drugs. But, there is still hope. I am going to visit the methadone clinic closest to me. I hope they take someone like me. I hope they realize I am no different physiologically. That my body depends on this to be ok. I hope they realize I can't do this cold turkey and I can't do it alone. There is a stigma that patients can't get help in some areas because we were not out "scoring on the street" and it's not taken as seriously. I have been told to just suck it up by a few uncaring doctors or to drive the 8 hours every month to my previous one. It's a long complex issue, just like we all have our own story I guess. Yes, I want to be well for my kids. I don't want to be bed ridden from the pain of the tumor or the VEDS, and i don't want to be bedridden from endless withdrawal. I don't want to be a zombie either for the time i have left. I wish there was a middle I could find. Perhaps something that would not just mask the physical pain and let me even live a bit longer because they absolutely need me. I am a mother of 12 year old twins and have been fighting to stay alive since they were born. I have made it 10 years past what try thought I would. So, I know I am a fighter. And, all that i have been through should make doing cold turkey easy...but this is one thing that has stopped me in my tracks, has brought me to my knees, and made me feel like I would do anything just to make it stop. But, I am not doing that. I am locked in my house, have no car, I have made sure I can not leave to do something out of desperation. I came to this forum because more like it need to be in place. Someplace I can talk freely without judgment society often brings with such topics. I can talk to people who have been through this and down this road before. It is a comfort knowing I am not alone. 160mg of Oxy abruptly stopped with no warning was not how I wanted things just as I am sure anyone else in my predicament or other predicaments. The reason we got here in my mind is not of issue, the fact we are here is..and i appreciate your words. I have contacted a methadone clinic and am thinking about going for it. I am day two cold turkey and I know i can't do it alone. Thank you for your understanding. I don't know if they will help me or look at my case the same as I will in hospice care until I moved, where I have not been able to find continued care due to being new and all the regulations that have now passed. I worry about some of the repercussions of Methadone, which makes no sense in the reality of it. I just want some semblance of normalcy back. I need to work and be productive as long as I can. I need my sanity. I think I am just petrified to make the leap and worried what family will think. But, I need to do what is best for me and my kids. Thank you for your response. Sorry, but that went way over my head. What gen m3 were you looking at? And the golf was faster than the focus?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt. Car saved my life no idea what speed I was doing but it was bad enough for the front right rim to be sheared in half. Currently being fixed by my friends shop under insurance, he said the bill will be around ~30k.Exactly.  I bought my car with less than 20k miles and had to replace clutch and a few other things already.  Moral of the story is everyone rags out Subaru’s.[deleted]lol nobody cares about your follow up post, what are you bipolar? you obviously felt some type of way, go back to crafting those anal beads...Follow up post don’t mean shit if you are an asshole from the start. The guy has been clean for a min and saved up for something he wanted, then you shit on it. So who’s the asshole?I had a Chevy Spark EV. Actually a really nice car. Zippy too with 400 ft-lbs of torque. The only thing is unless you're driving a Tesla, your range is only gonna be like 100 miles if you're lucky, so you have to live in a city that has charging stations all around town, like a big California city, or Dallas, etc. Still, they're inexpensive to buy, cheap to maintain, and only cost like $30/mo to charge at home. Oh, my bad G.  I didn’t realize that was also you.  Gotta condense those comments haha. At least reply to your own comment lolWhat model? My recent “gift of sobriety” was leasing a MB C300 hah.  Whenever I bitch about the money I just think about how much I squandered on dope. * stock wrx 
That says it all put the money u spent on that audi on a subi+ less than half of the difference in mods and ur left quicker than a baby on a doorstep.will it smoke a tesla?Yes, you do. You have to take care of yourself first momma! If not, all else will fall apart.  Methadone saved my life.. Day in day out when I was using turned me into a mom my kids did not deserve and I finally went to a clinic and started on methadone and I was very lucky that it worked so well in such a short amount of time and didn't have to be at a really high dose, so my drug use stopped that week and I've never used again. It changed my life and my kids life. Everyday when I was using, even having a steady supply so I didn't have to be sick all that much, but I would get up in the morning when our alarm went off and my kids would get up and sit at the kitchen table to wait for breakfast.. And me? I had to go to the bathroom and do a line to get me to even function enough to get my kids food.. After they ate, they got themselves dressed for school and then watched tv for a bit before leaving for the bus.. While they watched tv I did another line dreading the walk to the bus stop. Once they got on the bus and I came home I spent my day getting high until they got home and days I didn't spread out my drugs good enough and withdrawal started setting in.

  


I was stuck on the couch watching the clock and battling the anxiety of wanting time to go faster cuz I was waiting for more drugs or couldn't get any and wanted the day to end, and on the other hand, I didn't want time to move at all cuz that meant me having to make dinner and give baths and just taking care of my kids in general and it took everything in me to do simple things.

  


I used to think God I'm so lucky that my kids are amazing and know how to do a lot on their own and they don't need me for everything and I can stay laying down and once I got clean and on methadone I felt so guilty for thinking that... I'm not lucky that my kids could do the things they did cuz I was either high or sick 24/7 and had a hard time doing things with and for my kids and as long as I did the absolute necessary things like feed them and bathe them and pay my rent, then I wasn't as bad as other addicted parents..

  


But that is not being lucky and my kids sure as hell weren't lucky!! They deserved sooo much better then I could give them and getting on methadone gave me a second chance to be the mom they deserved. Like you I couldn't leave to rehab and I certainly didn't have will power to do it myself and I stopped finding things I couldn't do and things that I kept putting off that I could do to help me and made my first app and it was the best thing I could of ever done!! Please please consider getting on methadone.

  


I know it seems like your replacing one drug with another and ya I guess it is, but there are many reasons to still go on it and any reasons you think are bad reasons to try it will never be good enough reasons to continue the path your on. Yes there are ppl who abuse methadone but those ppl weren't ready to change their life in the first place, so as long as your serious about it you can do this.

  


What ever your worries are now, trying to get your life back and move to a better path will be much easier to do when you stop using and you take something you only need once a day and everything that involved getting drugs and all the bs with it will no longer be something you deal with anymore and all you need to do now is what's best for you and give yourself a break and stop feeling guilty and let methadone do its job so you can focus you more important things!! Then after awhile and you feel stable and life is where you want it to be, then you decide with the dr if it's time to wean off and get fully clean.

  


However you stated your in pain and you were in hospice care, so methadone is likely even more right for you as it's very powerful and I personally know ppl on it that got addicted to pills and couldn't keep doing that but had bad pain and regardless they needed pain relief and methadone not only got them to stop abusing pills but it took care of their pain better then anything they ever took. So seriously consider it as it may work wonders for you, and again if you still want to find something for your pain down the road and get off methadone, you can do that but hold off doing any sort of weaning off once you've stabilized and your life is better in every way.

  


honestly if methadone stops your pain and works really well, it's not a bad thing if your on it for a very very long time. What matters is that you live the life you want to.. Someone with major depression that absolutely needs meds for the rest of their life to maintain a happy life wouldn't just not take their meds when it works for them and methadone for pain is no different.. If you get to be who you want to be and live the life you want to, and have it be pain free and stop using other drugs that can take you back down this path and that means using methadone for life/very long time, then why wouldn't you? Don't let the stigma cloud your thinking on this! It can absolutely give you your life back and could stop your pain so that you don't need anything else.. Two birds one stone lol

  


Also maybe look into cbd for pain.. I live in Canada and weed just became legal but before that I was always able to find CBD that has no THC and so many ppl swear by it for pain. I use it for anxiety and depression but it's supposed to work wonders for pain and it won't make you test positive for weed if you end up going on methadone and the clinic tests for weed. So that's something to look into.

  


If you ever need to talk please pm me anytime :) from one mom to another, I know what it's like to be done and wanted to get better and I did and so can you! You don't have to do it alone and there's no reason to do it alone when there are other ways that have helped thousands of ppl. Let methadone do its job so you can be the mom you want to be and get your life back and never worry about any of this ever again!!! ❤️I was worried about starting methadone also...mostly bc I have to go in every day but Sunday for my dose...and then eventually, over time, I will get more take home doses as long as I'm clean. It's just a pain in the ass....BUT it keeps me from messing around and selling my dose or taking too much...like I did when I was on suboxone. I've tried suboxone, cold Turkey, and even the vivitrol shot....but methadone is the only thing that actually feels ok to me. I still used a little for the first month....but I went from taking 250-300mg per day to only 60-90mg per day....just to help with some of the break through withdrawal symptoms...bc they start you off at 30mg and slowly move you up...now that I'm at 65mg of methadone I dont feel the need to use opiates as much at all...my cravings are way down, and sometimes I'll go awhile without even thinking about using....so far methadone is working the best for me...and hopefully I can stick with it! 
Good luck to you as well...it's hard, and you're right about the cold Turkey crap...its almost impossible to deal with and not use...the only way I could do cold Turkey is if I had no access to opiates or I was in a detox unit....Bicycles maybe?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt. Car saved my life no idea what speed I was doing but it was bad enough for the front right rim to be sheared in half.

Such a beast of a car, I went from a Mazda 3 to this with a akrapovic exhaust installed it sounds like a super car. 600HP Bi-Turbo.I had a E36 M, E 46M, but not the E92 so was looking at one if those. I would grab a nice E46M but they are getting overpriced now. Of course a Hellrot Red E30 M would suffice �

I need to drive about 50 miles one way into Miami  daily so i needed something quick, agile and really good on gas, oh and 6spM of course. The ST was nice but the Recaros were a no go. I am 6'1 250 lbs..I dont need AWD like a WRX, so i am trying the Golf. Damn, well those 6 series are heavy beasts with tons of electronics and safety stuff so no surprise it saved u. Glad u are ok. I almost wiped out a mom and two little kids so that was it for me. 

I was in a left turn lane waiting for the light and nodded out briefly. Well the lane next to me going straight got their green and took off. I woke up and just took off, of course my turn signal was still red� i turned right into the path of the Jeep and we missed each other by an inch.

That was 2 yrs ago this Nov. and i put to bed a 30 yr opi run.Yup, also there is only one Sub dlr around here and the service lanes are always packed, fuk that.I think when it comes down to it... It's a total roll of the dice on how reliable ur truck will be no matter what, they put together by humans and driven by humans, human error is prominent like I've seen brand new Dodge 1500 blow an oil line, 10k mile Silverado blow to tranmy, I've seen something drastic in all brands... None of those where in the last 7 years tho so it's getting better 
and then calls people a "fucktard" when telling them to read his bitchmade follow up post lmao, no wonder he stands alone �Hyondi has the Kona, and Chevy has the Volt or the Bolt  I think theres others. (leaf?)  lots are getting onto the 200 mile range now.  I personally have a Volt.  


Gets me anywhere I need frst 100km on electric, and about 500 more after that on the genie.  


I do about 60-70% of my mileage on electricity.Correct.  
  
 u/yttik822 , first and foremost, you must take care of yourself. If you need to take time to get clean and you have the chance, take it. Your family knows when you're not at 100%. Take some time for yourself to get there.  
  
I'm a mom myself, and gave up custody of my children to get clean and get a job. I know a couple other moms that did the same for themselves. Anyway, I've been working at the same place for three months, and I'm currently maintaining/weaning with suboxone. I'm not quite at a place yet where I could take care of my kids, but I'm trying my hardest to get there. You can, too. I believe in you! You can do this! Thank you as this is Information I needed. I was worried about whether or not it would help the pain from cancer. I know it's stronger than anything I've had. I have brain cancer and Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndome just to be clear so you know a little about me. A clinical case that scares doctors away as there is no fix, just relief until the day my body quits. I also worry because I need to get a job and it has to be enough to support a household if something should happen to my husband. He has carried me through the last ten years of surgeries and chemo etc. Otherwise, I have two Bachelor's Degrees and i accomplished them while going through all of this, but i am unable to work as sick as I am and half of that is even with my pain control, I am in too much pain. It's never been managed properly and I refused to up my dose higher in case I need surgery again and they can't control the pain as I am in this for the long haul. For me, it's not so much about getting "clean" as it is functioning. Not worrying if my insurance won't pay, can't leave town because meds are due, running a day short due to a bad day, etc. I could name all the reasons, but you know them as it's not different. I bought heroin once. I watch my friend shoot it and seize in my car. I ahd to do CPR and he almost died before I could get him to the hospital. But, that is how desperate I was to not be sick. Our insurance had changed and I was waiting on a preauth so I could not get my meds that day. Even after witnessing that, I still almost used it. It was by the grace of God, I flushed it and dealt with the withdrawal. If it can help my pain and it will not get in the way of rhe career i am trying to accomplish (there's not enough money in art and music for me) then I definitely am interested. Another fear, is closing the door to future hospice care should I find a doctor here willing to take my complicated case. If for some reason, the methadone would not work. I also worry as I am in an abusive relationship, if I left would my husband be able to take my kids. 

I also relate to your description of your day. I can't function in the morning. I can barely roll out of bed. It takes at least an hour or more to be functional. After 10 years, I wake up in full blown withdrawal, which should not happen on long acting meds. But, it does. I don't dream anymore as I don't go into REM sleep. I am perpetually tired. I can't remember as well. I am also very dependent in benzos. Those I never have issues getting though. Doctors seem to be less scared of them, but if you ask me they are more scary. I went a week without mine once just thinking i could...bad idea. And I don't even take all i am allowed to take as I hate nodding off. I hate not having control of my actions. It's why I don't drink or anything. Anyway, I will go. I only wish I had gone yesterday or Thursday as Monday seems forever away. I have Kratom. It helps a little. Not a lot. I used to have some great weed, it's all gone. Won't be to Seattle for another year so there is that. Here they have medical MJ, but it's not strong enough. Anyway, thank you so much and I'd love to talk more. It seems we can definitely relate to one another. And, for what it's worth, your story is inspiring to me.Yes, I agree, no matter the situation that ended a person hooked on opiates; whether it be illness in my case or other reasons, the outcome of not having them ubruptly is the same. And, cold turkey feels nearly impossible to me. I just wish i had gone in on Thursday when I knew I'd be dealing with this. But, even then I would be facing detox at home until Monday when a doctor could review my intake. I guess that is lucky though as in other places it can be weeks or months until someone can get help. In the meantime, bad things can happen. My heart is with anyone dealing with this on any level for any reason. The dialogue about addiction and dependence needs to change in this country. I hope it does sometimes. I wish you the best of luck and i am glad you found something that helps. This is so much more than needing a drug to function, it's a literal biochemical change and professionals need to realize it and treat it as such. I will know more Monday which route I am taking. In the meantime, I am taking the day second by second. No sleep in two days and all the aweful symptoms on top of the illness I needed the drugs to help. In my own opinion, it's so unethical for anyone to have to suffer like this. We don't let our dogs suffer like this. Why do we allow it for human beings? Take care. I think just talking on here and hearing that I am not alone has been one of the biggest helps. I appreciate it.Yeah, they're fun at hell! I used to actually be a BMW tech. Ah man, I love the 6spd e46 M3s,they're so dope. Maybe an S54 MCoupe clown shoe? Those are for fire as well. Yeah. The Chevy Spark doesn't take gas whatsoever. It's 100% electric, and is from 2014. The technology has developed a bit since then. I can imagine they're better than they were four years ago. Sorry I just saw this reply after I replied to your other comment lol.. Please go Monday.. Some ppl even get dosed the same day!Neat, but i need a DD/Commuter. A guy around me has a blue MCoupe, love it. His other car is a Ford GT.�It needs to be a four-seater? Yes, only due to i am a big guy and may need to run a 3rd person around. Iooked at the new Civic Si as well but that 1.5l is too small.

I looked a 2005 Z06 but it does not fit my mission. I looked at the Tesla Model 3 but holy shit $70k !!!!
I thought they were like 35k wtf ??What about a GTO? 

C5 ZO6 is fucking dope though.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😓💉🔫, Content: , ups: 1025, downs: 0You ever have a guy who can't make up his mind with this?

One time he barely exchanges a word with you while you're in some sketch ass parking lot, the next time he wants to sit in a Wendy's/chat for an hour & then the *next* time you come at him all friendly and he tells you to stfu? ���������Is anyone like butters from South park in these situations? Yes, I do believe I know what you are sayinglmaoThat’s really how it be to...�

Too fucking funny bro...����Thats why you meet at a store  or Walmart or mall.Real life! Ha ha ha... Real talkDidn't know Kurt was dealing by his own o\_o

&#x200B;"get up on the porch" said dBoy. This is a great picture though. That’s awesome as fuck. Although  the last dealer I had would let me use his bathroom to fire up. Then I didn’t care hanging out. Kurt’s like fuck Eric, I don’t want to hear about these bone thugs n harmony Right now I’m sick af! Is this a real pic or is it photoshopped? If its real this will be the second pic I've seen of Kurt Kobain hanging out with gangsta rappers. The other one was him sitting in a van with tupacI remember the days man... Lol. Damn i remember when i use to just hang with dealer for hours. He wven started calling me nephew because i went everyday and so neighbors wont get suspicious. You guys ever get dealers who leave you on read? Lol that shit kinda yikes.HahaLol one time i was coppin from my boy who was chillin with two bloods. We wound up talkin bout photo albums and the value of pictures to hold on to memories like pictures of kids and stuff. 10/10 great convoMost of the the time I don't mind chilling with my dealers, usually they let me get high inside, and are always passing around a blunt and/or alcohol, sometimes even a plate of coke.

For whatever reason I have never been treated like a fiend by my dboys, and seem ronalways garner their respect, resulting in great hood credit and short waits if inwait at all.Don't dip the pen in company ink��������Eazy E looks a lot like Michael Jackson pre-surgery.Lol sometimes the abundance of memes can be bothersome but this one is �I generally wont buy from someone unless I can sit and talk with them about cool shit for awhile anyway, unless I'm desperate and dopesick. Friends haven't fucked me over yet, but a rando dealer sold a friend of a friend a fat bag of fent laced heroin that would have killed him had he not done a small allergy test first. Be careful out there, kids.This made my day. 100%Too real���[deleted]Lmao that pictures iconic Whenever a dealer gets extra nice with me I know it’s because they just want me to sleep with them. The struggles of being an average looking girl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
This dude I’ve been going to for over a year is super super respectful though. Jokes with me, doesn’t get mad if I accidentally get lost, been to his house, met his family, even given him and his brother rides before. He’s never made advances at me and I appreciate it so much bc every other dude I’ve gone to has. 
So I guess I can say we’re friends? Whenever I’ve taken a break from using I genuinely miss seeing him haha. Such a chill dude and super down to earth. Lol cause the white boy in the hood, in clothes that don't blend in and his general look that stands out from the norm doesn't look suspect at all Everyone knowsThe funniest things are always true ! Kirsten face though I'd awesome ! I wish he was still alive !! Is that E and Yella? I hate it. Especially when I have an Uber waiting for me!!Ik, That's the irony This is gorgeous �That's the type that doesn't typically get caught. Constantly changing mo fucks with cops on your tail.dude sounds bipolar lolThey are not your friends why go talk to him like youre all homies next day after you were kewl with them the day before?..i also hate that shit when people try to be all kewl with their supervisors. I mean yes you want to kiss ass to be in his position. Especially when they cross the line. Not jealous,just know where you at,and your positionEvery. Single. Time.

It's a toss up between having to get into his car to either do a quick exchange or we sit and talk for 10 minutes. If not that we'll do a window exchange. Its different every single time and never know which method well be using every time we meet up Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, you don't have to keep asking. I never cop at Wal-Mart. Too much security and cameras. Restaurant parking lots is where it's at. You clearly have never had the luxury of copping in an open air. 

This is exactly the scenario every single time. Stairs and all.Or restaurant or store or mall.is it a real picture??  why would they even be chillin' together?? other than for some a-hole record producer to get a pic of his cash cows...Im assuming this is fake.  Ive seen one with him and biggie or maybe tupac in a van and its also fake but done very wellIkr like bro do you wanna make money or not??On read? Like a book? If so that must be nice,them giving you a book while your waiting Exactly and when you're chilling and they're smoking blunts you start working on cheaper prices for bigger quantities. Nobody was talking about having any sex with their dealer lmao You're doing something very human but also dangerous, you're attempting to create rules to follow to tame reality. This is the root and start of religion and superstition.

You should test your dope no matter the relationship you have with the dealer, good terms won't stop a chemical from killing you.Because it is? you dropped a \\That’s the jokeOr just sometimes he’s tweaking/coked up/drunk and has shit he wants to say I think maybe people enjoy being friends with people. What is the appeal in being on shitty terms with people you are constantly in proximity with? So u can maybe get on their good side for a potential hook up or the ever so rare and elusive *frontal of the bags*Not in the bathrooms Lol Walmart security is a joke though.I’m not sure. I mean All 3 of them are very influential musicians and probably had mutual respect for each otherThats the other one I have seen. I didn't know it was fake and always thought it was them being shuttled to or from the VMA's that year. Given that they were both big in the same decade that made perfect senseYo that pic isn't exactly fake, it was just cropped together to have them in the same photo, Kurt Cobain and BIGGIE were in that shuttle together. That means they're dry and waiting for the reup. At least in my experience. This is my problem all the time and it doesn’t make sense. You know they have what you want and you have told them you have the money and still they bullshit and take their sweet ass time . Like dude seriously do you want this money ? Because if someone else with shit just as good hits me up in the meantime , I’m copping from them ��‍♂️I know one dealer had magazines in his office, oh wait that was my doctor.I always test a very small amount of each bag before I dive in. I didnt mean for it to sound like I implicitly trust anyone who sells dope lolVery beautifully said.This so much. I understand we don't come from the same backgrounds, but I can guarantee we have similar interests and talking to each other for 5-10 min each day would probably broaden both our mindsets on the other person and their lifestyle/culture.Why consider your dealer your friend if you know he doesnt care about you and just your money. For the buyer   the only reason why  they would want to be friends is to get more free stuff. If possible. But you know that a dealer and a buyer wont ever be close friends.  Especially on a "business " that requires more cold heart than making friends by selling dope. In that case make friends on tinder.  For job being a friend with a supervisor is almost the same thing as a dealer. But the worker under supervisor wants a raise or if there is ever an opening supervisor would hook it up. This is where the saying comes in" is not how smart you are or what you have done,but how many people you know in the right places" i guess i see it that way because i went to school,i spent hours of the night doing homework to be somebody successful, never did i rely on anybody to get me where i want to be. Yes its nice having friends at work. But being friends with your boss ,to me it shouldnt cross the line. Especially if something goes wrong theyll tell on you.

TL:DR // dont expect somebody to get you or give you what you want. Dont rely on anybody {job} dealer only cares about his money and thats all (drugs) 

Ps. This is my opinion. Would love to have a friendly conversation if you dont agree with me on this Why not? My dude did that for a while. Lol it was always weird though. True that. Sure, but there's almost always a cop posted there, and if not, then Wal-Mart won't hesitate to call them. Plus, there are cameras everywhere. It's just not a good idea. may be true... but i don't really see "mutual respect" on any of their faces in this picture... do you?I wish it was legit that shit would be legendaryhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/kurt-cobain-biggie-photo-krist-novoselic-2072237Nah... Completely different whips. 


https://www.bananaklip.com/blog/kurt-cobain-2pac-biggie-photo-rare.amp[deleted]Acting kewl with my Dope man might not get me a friendship BUT I like to interact with them a bit beyond the handoff.  Especially if they're a new connect.  Mostly so I can get a feel for them and also it builds a level of trust.  Even if that level is tiny.  I like to know how the person im dealing with operates also so i/we can be safer about operations and avoid detection.I agree with not relying on people and all, but maybe the dealer thing depends on where you are and how your place operates.  I wouldnt try and make friends with someone in an open air market but where I am, you have to know someone and it helps to be friendly.It’s probably when Judgement Night soundtrack came out. All the grungers and metal doodz did songs together. Sub Pop SeattleDamn good article. Yea if Kurt hadn't been killed I really think music would have gone in a totally other direction.Thanks for that. I  glad to know you are one of the exceptions. And im sure theres more people out there. Not jealous or anything. Im just glad that you are ok and everything turned out better for you. Take care,and dont over do it (im no one to tell you that ,i know. Just mean well.)This was a good exchange and while I in some ways want to be friends with my boss I do understand that he doesn't actually give a fuck about me and would forget about me the next day if i got fired/left.  Dealers are different since they aren't paying you, its the opposite actually, so I can see and have become good friends with a dealer.  I mean at least with them you have a common interest and implicitly trust each other with some pretty illegal shit.  But ya no way I believe that I'm friends with my boss @@@@@@@@@@ Title: You were my best friend, Content: You were 14. You rode the bus home with us every day. We'd get to your house and run upstairs, only 15 or so minutes until your mom got home. We'd pack the bong, hit the patio, blast The Beatles and smoke until we were on the floor coughing. That 70's Show was always on at this time, right after Scrubs finished. We always talked about how similar your dad was to Red Foreman. We were young, high, and had no idea what the world had in store for us, but we were happy. Your house always had the best snacks.

You were 16. I drove us all home after school, and as always, we'd unload at your place. You and Marcus would argue over who'd roll today's blunt, and I'd sit back and laugh at how dumb the two of you were. Your mom stopped caring about us smoking pot, cause we were on the verge of young adulthood and both got accepted into the college of our dreams. Getting stoned wasn't quite what it used to be, as with all the pressures of becoming an adult, came unwarranted amounts of anxiety. We were also too old to act the way we used to when we got high, something that really only seemed to affect me because you were always so damn mature. I hated that. Your cousin sold us some xanax, and we'd split one into three and drift away. For those couple of hours we were untouchable. Nothing mattered, we were the only ones who existed. We couldn't imagine life any other way, why bother? Nobody could tell us we weren't living life exactly how we were supposed to.

You were 18. You finally had set up our dorm exactly how we envisioned; TV's facing opposite direction so screen-looking was a thing of the past, microwave on top of the toaster oven on top of the mini fridge, a drawer full of weed paraphernalia and 7 posters of our favor artists, movie scenes and cliche college quirks. You passed me the straw as I broke my roxy in half, pieces flying everywhere that I would eventually try and find later.. You were more accurate then you thought your were when you would joke about me doing that. I'd separate the big, fluffy line into three smaller ones, and you'd suck yours down all at once. My tolerance was the same as yours was, but I lacked the $200 check you'd get from your parents every Monday. I was always kind of annoyed by that, but you'd occasionally show my broke-ass some love. Me and my girlfriend were fighting, and it got so bad that you drove me 400 miles to see her while your car was literally falling apart every step of the way. Your parents were so pissed that you drove while your car was in that kinda condition, but you told them it was something you had to do. It actually hurt you to see me cry, cause it was something you had never seen me do in the 14 years we were friends. Your transmission was replaced and your parents were $2400 poorer, but we were on our way back to school. You had just affirmed yourself as the most caring person in my life. My dad had passed and my mom was back in France, but I had you.. and for that I was pretty damn lucky.

It was your 19th birthday. It was my birthday literally just the day before, and we would always celebrate them together. You walked into the dorm and I pretended not to notice you, which had recently become the norm. I had the funniest story of this failed attempt to spit game at some girls after psych class, but I knew I'd be saying that for someone else. We had stopped talking for about a month now, due to your stubbornness and my inability to break a grudge, regardless of how petty it may have been. You were wearing long sleeves in July, but I didn't notice. You'd sit on your bed and watch ancient aliens, and I'd find some excuse to leave the dorm. Your presence drove me mad, as I'm sure mind did yours. Truthfully, I don't think either of us knew why we were fighting, only that we were and that any attempt to act otherwise would make us look weak. My connection to all things opiate were officially cut off, but yours only grew stronger. After a fun week of dope-sickness, I finally started feeling like myself again. The benzos would kick in, and I'd head out to my new friends house. We'd hit every club, every big sporting event or social gathering we caught wind of, so we could take dope photos for people to admire on Facebook. You'd sit at the dorm, and watch ancient aliens with the lights always off.. No matter what time I'd come home, you were at the dorm watching that damn show. I brought some girl home one night, praying that you had found something else to do. You hadn't, and I officially had to take her somewhere else. I made sure to be as loud and obnoxious as I could while grabbing my shit, ensuring that you acknowledged my presence and current lifestyle as better than yours before walking out. It still hurt to see you like that...
You said nothing. You were still wearing a long sleeve shirt, and I still hadn't noticed.

You were 22. You were outside of the gas station when I drove up, smoking a cigarette. You were bench pressing 185lbs at 14 years old our freshmen year of highschool, and here you were a senior in college looking like you weighed maybe a buck twenty. Your skin was pale, and the bags under your eyes hung about as low as my thoughts of you at that time. I smiled and you smiled, but we had nothing to say to one another. We were strangers, and we both had very different things to do. I saw you a couple weeks later, and I was pretty drunk. You looked even worse than you did the last time I saw you, which had to have been a hard task to accomplish. I was worried. I spent twenty minutes lecturing you and trying to mirror your image onto yourself so that you could see what I saw, but it was hopeless. You didn't see the issue, either that or you were too far gone and refused to acknowledge it. The kid behind you was sketchy and hung around you like a shadow, stepping in when I started to get emotional. He told me to fuck off, and I blamed him for destroying my best friend. The drunken tears started to fall, but my friends in the car were yelling my name. The tears were wiped away quicker then they fell, but I know you noticed them. Your friend laughed, but you didn't. I still cared, and you did too.

You were 23. Your oldest brother had received his sentence, and would be doing 17 years for trafficking, possession and selling to an undercover. Your younger brother still wouldn't talk to you. You had just gotten out of jail for violating probation, after getting caught stealing a drug test at Walmart. I heard the news and almost laughed, I couldn't understand how far you had fallen. You were always so much better than me in life, it was unreal to see how things had changed. I had my degree, a good job and a support system of friends that held through everything. You had a criminal record, a pocket full of pills and contact list full of people you either bought drugs from or sold to. I'd see you occasionally as I drove to work, and every time it was like seeing a ghost. I had no feelings for you anymore, no judgement. My painkiller habit had picked back up, but for some reason I still felt above you. I ended up running into you a few weeks ago, while I was picking up a few oxy 30's from my dude. You seemed almost excited that we were back on the same plane of existence, but I was disgusted. You tried conversing, generally interested in how I was, what I was doing these days and how my mom was. My answers were short, and I couldn't get away from you fast enough. It was obvious, and it didn't take you long to notice. You had fallen pretty low, but you were still as conscious as ever. I watched you take a long drag of your cigarette as I pulled away, staring directly into eachothers eyes. We were officially on two different planes of existence. I had no business on yours, and vise versa. This was the last time I ever saw you.

I got the news today. Your name and face was plastered across my Facebook wall, where every memory and funny instance with you was on full display. I considered writing my own status in your memory, but I couldn't. It just didn't feel right after all we had been through, and how I had treated you over the years. The cause of death wasn't broadcasted, but it didn't need to be, I already knew. Though it feels like 10 years since I've spoken to you, I can't help but think about all the time we spent together. Every minute of my life from 7 years old until 19, involved you in some way. You were the kid who I experienced life with, who I made mistakes with, who I got my first kiss next to.. You always gave me shit for having my eyes wide open. You brought me to parties, you fought alongside me, you accepted me as a brother and let me into your family when I felt like I didn't have my own. You cheered for me when I won, cried with me when I lost, and threw up with me when I was drunk or dope sick. You cared about me, through everything, and I threw you out of my life when you needed me the most. You never needed me, you were always the one I relied on for anything I went through, but you were always okay. When the time came that you weren't, I no longer had a need for you. I abandoned you, and you still forgave me. You still sent me invites on Xbox live, you still told funny stories about me with mutual friends and you still told your parents about all I had accomplished. You still gave a shit, you still cared. You were no longer a part of my life, but I was always a piece of yours, just a little lost along the way. You were the greatest thing I ever gave up in this lifetime, I'm sure of that.

You were my best friend. , ups: 1013, downs: 0Jesus I did not have a signed permission slip for that feels trip.Fuck man that was beautiful.  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss. This was beautifully written and inspired me to reach out and bury the hatchet with someone I haven't spoke to in six months I am actually hysterical in tears right now. that was such a beautiful, eloquently written story. thank you so so so much for sharing...

I am deeply sorry for your loss. your words make me mourn right there with you. this cut me deep. a feeling all too familiar... rest in peace.

sigh.Story hits so close to home for me, it was almost scary to read that. My best fried passed away from an overdose 5 years ago. We had always been on the same playing field when it came to drugs until one day he passed me. I was still addicted to roxys but thought he was so much worst off than me. Everyone knew what he was doing and how he was falling fast but did nothing. I tried to help him out and let him stay at my house but kicked him out when I found that he shot up in my house which was so hypocritical cause I was still getting high just wasn't using the rig yet. I kicked him out. The last time I saw him he was with my dealer and he looked terrible. We exchanged awkward what's ups but I got out of there as fast as I could. All I could do was text him and tell him he was better than that's so needed to stop. A few weeks later after that I got a text saying he was dead. I didn't even ask how, I already knew. I could have done so much more to save him.

 Fast forward almost 5 years later and I've become a heroin addicted over the last 4 years. Shooting up daily for a year and a half and screwing over everyone I knew. I've been to rehab and halfway houses and still havnt managed to string together more than a few months. Now I have friends texting me saying I'm better than that and need to stop.i think back to my best friend and I'm exactly like him, it just took me a little longer to get there

 Addiction is hard and scary thing to see someone go through. Most people don't know how to confront it or feel to uncomfortable to do anything about. Sometimes it's easier just to block it out and move forward. The person addicted is so caught up that they don't see all the obvious signs of how close to death they are that everyone sees. I'm lucky to have a few friends and family show me how close I was to death and all I can do now is do everything I can to stop and accept their accountability. 

 It may sound cheesy or the situation may seem uncomfortable but if you see someone you love get that close to death do something about it. My biggest regret in my 28 years is giving up on one of my best friends and after 5 years I still think about it all the time. 

Sorry for your loss OPThis might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on Reddit.  
May he RIP.Damn man

Nothing like this to remind the human race that grudges and long term anger situations benefit absolutely no one

I'm so sorry about your friend, and I hope you are able to find peace sooner rather than later in this situation. It's not your fault, i know this is insanely more easy to talk than to act but try not to live in the regret over lost time. That existence will never let you move forward with life

Your friend would want you to keep going, to keep succeeding 

.I'm so so sorry for your loss ❤️I'm sorry for your loss. This shit is too real. Brought me to tears reading this :'( rest in peace to your friend, he sounds like he was a good personIt's so lame and cliche... But that really just brought tears to my eyes. Big hugs dude.condolences my friend. don't let your relationship at the end depict how you think back about him though. pm if you needa ear Ow. Holy shit.  This was amazing, I'm gonna hug my friends more often.this really touched me. i'm so sorry about your best friend. i see myself in your best friend, but i also see myself in you. we all have so many flaws. forgive yourself. if nonody told u today, i love you bud.This is so human and a wonderful, sad, beautiful, read.  Thank you for sharing this story and I really hope you will go easy on yourself.  It is really affirming to see such great people do exist and in so many of us.  We all have such suffering and it is so bittersweet to see what good friends you were and the reality of how our lives can go.  When my wife gets home I will definitely share this with her and others.  What a write.  Take care.Fuck this got me. It was good hearing from the other side. I have a neighbor friend i went threw everything with since the age of 5. Halfway threw college tho it became clears drugs weren't just for fun anymore and were part of my life. I've lost so many friends and have spent months being along since graduation. Everyone else having girlfriends and life and me stuck in the same day to day grind of just focusing on getting high. 

It was good to read this and see from someone else's proseptive.The was gut wrenching.....but such a beautiful tribute to your friend and to your pain. Thank you for sharing.I'm in tears. I am so so sorry. Maybe you could do something to honor him in some way. Although I think you just did. Oh man this hits home. I'm sorry to hear about your buddy. But at least you realize the treatment you gave him and have paid your respects.

Keep truckin buddy. Nothing I read on reddit has ever made me cry, but two years just fell down my face after reading all of that, and then that last line. That last line just did it for me.

Guys, the takeaway from this is to cherish your loved ones and your friends. ALWAYS.

You simply do not know how much more time you have left with them.I'm sorry man. Don'the be too hard on yourself.  It sucks but it's not your fault God damn this Reddit post is right in the feels Condolences...

I do not envy the endless amount of nights this shall keep you awake, in tears.This is beautiful. I am so so sorry for your loss. please do not beat yourself up!  Take this and learn from it. RIP dear friend. I could barely read the end of that through the tears. That was beautiful man im so sorry. I can relate.Damn.This one hurt. I saw myself and friend in this too a tee, from the beginning to when you got back into pills. The only difference is that after many rock bottoms, my friend cleaned up, and I was a the fucked up one now. I ignored him for so long to "focus on my sobriety" that now that he is clean, and I'm the fuck up, I can't bring myself to reach out, because I know he would accept me even when I wouldn't do the same for him when I was clean. Our mutual friend ODed a few weeks back, and I couldn't even walk up to him at the funeral, even though it was always the three of us back in the day....

Good writing draws the reader in and makes him feel like he is part of the story, and fuck if you didn't pull me in. Sorry for your loss homie.this story broke my heart... I hope all of you struggling with opiate addiction get help and get better pills are the worst. Sorry for your loss. What kills me is reading these types of stories that all start out with... We smoked pot a lot... Then leads to one of us got addicted to xyz drug... But people still get upset when you say weed is/can be a gateway drug.Opiates fucking fucking suck man. This has me crying thinking about the people I left behind when I moved across the country to get away from the habbit. I talk to my ex occasionally. And every time I tear up hearing how she still is shooting the shit. And I know it's just going to be a matter of time before I hear the news I don't want to hear. I'm sorry you lost your friend. Some people get hooked and stay hooked, some people get hooked and get out. Both sides end up losing something.damn that was a sad/good readWell-written reflection. The best of luck to you -- death that goes by with someone who one has not reconciled with is always difficult This may sound stupid... But was it a H overdose?Damn... that was deep man. Deep as fuck...



RIP





I know it is cliche but it is fucking true. You never realize what you have until it is truly gone.Oh god I'm tearing up. 

God fucking dammit this was beautifully written. I'm so sorry, OP. I'm so sorry. Here's to hoping you find peace. As someone who has lost her brother and cousin all I can say is don't give up on yourself!My heart breaks for you. I wish I could find better words but this post destroyed me. Take care of yourself man. Hauntingly beautiful. Sorry to hear this mate.FUCK I was not expecting to cry tonight because today as such a marvelous day but fuck this really hit me. I'm so sorry man. May he rest in peace. I've lost 4 best friends which includes my baby's mom due to heroin. I really feel your pain, trust me. Keep doing well. You've seen enough to help you, we all wish you the best. I saved this story to show to others, I hope you don't mind(I mean it is on Reddit). Hopefully your story will show at least one individual the right and wrong paths that are there to fall into. Super relevant to my life right now, thanks for sharing! And sorry for your lossHoly shit man. Wow. This one really hit me. Sorry for your lossWow, this really struck a chord with me man. I lost one of my best friends to U4 about 3 weeks ago, and of course his fucking funeral was on October 7, the day that toxic fucking garbage was finally scheduled. Seeing his sister and brother-in-law and realizing I was probably the only one that knew exactly what happened still haunts me to this day. They knew he OD'd obviously, but they have no idea about RC's, especially not U4. Every time my phone buzzes in the middle of the night, I still think he's sending me a link to some random youtube video, every time I go to make a call, my fingers seem to automatically gravitate to speed dialing his name. I've been mostly clean for a couple years now so I don't come here or post nearly as much as I used to, but I needed to let you know that you're not alone, for better or worse. Knowing how it feels to lose someone, but to a more traditional (?) cause, this makes me feel quite sad. Also, excellent writing.Man that's a great story/lesson/writing, I think I gotta call a buddy.... I hope others do the same.Hate to be the one but sounds like after the fact you're just trying to make yourself feel better about yourself, would have mattered a lot more if you came to all this before he died, and actually tried to help him.  Sorry, but seems that you just got the lucky end of the opiate trip and he didn't.I swear to god I'm just cutting onions.

At workHaving falling outs with best friends is the worst... I feel like this has happened to me way too often, and maybe I'm the problem? Anyways, I'm so sorry for your loss. What a horrible feeling. FuckI'm crying, i can't even imagine how you feel...

I'm really sorry.I didn't think I would tear up but I really did. I'm so sorry man.
Wow. This is a very well written piece of literature. I can relate to both sides of the story. Which makes it hit home all that much harder. I hope you don't blame yourself, and have the capacity to make peace with the love/lost. So many grammatical errors in this wall of drivel. Sounds like you made the right move cutting the junkie out of your life, congrats � now it's time to take life by its dick and stroke it till the cows come home � � [deleted]That is amazingly well written.  I connected with a lot of the things you said.  I have a feeling we are pretty close in age.  Everything you said about the college days and the falling out hit so close to home.    
       
Except I am your friend.       
         
Luckily, I was taken out of the life of addiction and am now in recovery (214 days clean).  I was forced to drop out of college when I went to jail and then to a CBCF instead of prison for my felony.  I am now back in school and will graduate in May.  I feel like this story hit so close to home because if I wouldn't have slipped up and got arrested, I would more than likely be in the same place as your friend.       
       
I often wake up to things on Facebook very similar to this.  Just last week a decent friend of mine, that I hadn't spoken to since I took my "vacation" from society, was the latest to lose the fight against heroin.     
        
If I were you, I would use this tragic loss as motivation to get your life on the right track.  I'm not saying sobriety is right for everyone, but at least take a look at what you are doing and where you are going before you end up in the same place as many addicts before us.  Good luck and stay safe.OP from what I've just read, it sounded like you were a total asshole to him. You looked down on him for becoming an addict while you were doing the same shit, just at a different degree. He didn't steal from you, didn't start shit with you or anything like that. God forbid he stay home the night you decided to bang some slut and couldn't handle somebody else being there. You laughed at him when you saw him in town and and when he gets arrested. He tried to talk to you and reconnect and instead you blew him off after you got your drugs because you just could not be fucking bothered. That's all you cared about.

That's not how you treat somebody you call a "best friend". 

Maybe we just feel differently, but I never gave up on my friends. especially one that drove you 400 miles to see some bitch while fucking his car up in the process, just for your sake. I would help my bros hide a fucking body if it came down to it. 

This may sound harsh, and I don't know the whole story, but I feel that you completely failed him as a friend multiple times when he probably needed you the most. Regardless, he's gone now. My condolences to you and his family, may he rest in piece.
 So sorry for your loss I can never bring myself to read these am I dead inside? Oh sweetie. I wish I had words that would help you. But there are no words. But I understand your pain. My heart hurts for you.
Hugs.Sorry for your loss.Someguy did a spot on parody of this IN A new Post. Op on another note I truly feel for you and hope writing it all out helped even a little bit.THe parody is greatwhy did i read this.... damn...I lost my best friend to heroin too. I know them feels.fuck man this actually brought a tear to my eye, having lost a friend of 16 years as well. but from being your best friend at 18 to hardly even talking to each other or acting like friends at 19? yea, i definitely think there was something fucked up going on in between there you didn't mention, especially if fighting with each other was really the norm.

 to me, it seems like your friend started banging dope in the dorm room and from there it got worse and consumed him. I'm pretty sure he still cared about you all the way up to the end though. your VANITY consumed you which led you to drop him as a friend during what was probably the worst part of his life. i can't really say you're the good person in this after reading it twice. My best friend died while we were distant and most of our contact had been tinted with my shitty attitude about him using. I hated that he was still doing it and I had a terrible immature way dealing with it. I never got to say goodbye and it still just fucking kills me sometimes. I miss my friend so much. Fuck. :'(

I also kiss with my eyes wide open, btw. Always have. Weird.Just coming across this and wow. How hard your post hits home brings shivers. 

Brother I hope this friend forever lives on in your future life experiences and pray your intimate story may save even just one soul falling down this terrible path.

Thank you for writing this. I do believe what you have said here will help remedy self-destructive trust issues with friends, new and old, and help my ability to understand and empathize with persons I no longer know anymore, but who I once felt were one in the same with me.

I never could wrap my head around the relationship with my high school best friends. Our group of 3 was the closest friends could be, yet evolved to become the persons we would fuck over, and hurt, the most. I always just thought that we really never were "actual" friends... at least not how normal people's friendships were. We all had such fun---the time of our lives---but none of that mattered anymore. this is fucking brutalHoly fuck. Man... um... shit.... hmm... uh.... Jesus Christ this is powerful... I just. I don't know... wow.Wow I can't but be sad for you and hate you a little at the same timeImagine how many upvotes you would've gotten if you were actually a good friendtruthfully that is all i can ask for in writing this. i really appreciate itFor real though. I miss my dead friends... anyway, how are you? still  withdrawing? I get so emotional and forlorn when I'm sick. I read that with one eye while nodding out a couple times and it still brought me to tears. Right?i cant agree more. i know that if i went back i could rewrite his fate, i have no doubt in my mind he'd be alive and we'd still be best friends. that's the hardest part about all of this. they say things happens for a reason, and i guess sometimes even the most terrible of occurrences are meant to teach us lessons we could never learn any other way. all i can say to you is please man, please make the changes you know that you need to make. we all see ourselves through this golden filter, where things seem so much better then they actually are. your friends see you for who you really are, listen to them.. not to sound corny but there are so many people who care about you, including me This is the most beautiful thing I've seen.  Wow.  May he RIP.  i will admit that i am not the most complex of minds, it kindve just came out the same way the thoughts occurred. i thought the same thing after i wrote it, but its more a memoir to me than a piece of writing. i do appreciate it budStrangely I understood the misspelled words you were trying to type. The whole point of this story was a release for myself, to let out all the guilt Ive felt since he died considering how I could have saved him by being a better friend. Saying I'm trying to make myself feel better by talking about how shitty I treated him doesnt make much sense now does it guyThank you friendWhile I completely agree with almost everything you stated about the original post, the last phrase I would use to describe it would be "heart-warming". IMO it's more tragic, sad, and heavy than anything, but that's just my opinion and how I interpreted it.[deleted]Thank you brotherOP took the time to write honestly.  I have a lot of respect for that.  It seems like he is quite aware of his failings.  He had the balls to write down the reality of the situation as he sees it.  There are some shitty people in this world who never admit or acknowledge any wrong doing.  This doesn't seem like OP.  He seems to be learning from life, and that's the best we can do.  You wouldn't be able to call him out if he hadn't directly written what he did that was not great.  Come on guy, go easy huh?Dude stopPeople often tell themselves they are "better" than someone else for not using the same method to get high or they are able to maintain a job and some degree of normality in their life.  I have a hard time believing that in all of your years you have never done this exact same thing; writing someone off and then having a change of heart later.  People make mistakes, and OP most definitely realizes he made a mistake and cannot change it regardless of how hard he may try.  There is a time and place for comments, both good and bad, however I don't feel like this is the time for a comment like yours.  OP is looking for support, and if nothing else, he is going to be the reason that one of us reaches out to a friend that we have done this to and that is reason enough for OP to post.I think you missed the point of the post. OP is admitting to being a shitty friend and feeling bad about it. Why kick him while he's down?It's perfectly alright to give up on your friends.   Especially if you are still dealing with the same issues they are.  Life is not about being crabs in a bucketi just read it, i dont know if hes joking or if i genuinely pissed him off. i guess it was a bit of both. honestly though i didnt see it blowing up the way it did, it just felt nice to write it all out like thatNicely said. I claim to be everything but the good person in all that had happened, writing this to myself was the most honest way I could think of in processing what had just happened. I had no idea anyone would give a shit or even bother reading, it just felt like a journal entrythe fact you think any of this was about upvotes just shows how big a tool you really arePeople don't change unless they want to change. I think he meant the phrase "brought tears to my eyes" was lame and cliche. Maybe? I didn't find the memoir to your friend lame or cliche at all. Beautifully written. Sorry for your lossExactly, you're just interested in making yourself feel better.  Sounds like both before and after he died you were mainly interested in yourself.  Just calling it as it is.  Like I said, you got lucky.I know you didn't just say "tell a cop." ... That is literally the worst idea I ever heard. Please do NOT I repeat DO NOT go to the authorities and tell them about your friend who is using opiates. It's already done, I'm not going to delete it because that's how I feel about it. If the mods feel that what I said was bullying or hate speech I have faith they will remove it. I don't think it is though. I honestly think that if this didn't happen OP would have gone the rest of his life without speaking with his friend again and not thought twice about it. Then once the guy passed he suddenly cared enough to post this romanticized version of him writing someone off. 

I've heard the phrase "some people only love you after you're gone",   and I think that holds true here. Maybe I'm just jaded.No no,The dudes name is opaitesparody or some shit like that I guess he starting to parody some posts that are found on this sub and was just having fun. At least I didn't sense that he was upset or pissed in any way with you, he was just fucking around. While that's true, and I upvoted you, we can make a difference. 

People don't change unless they want to change, but we can help change their perspective. I know I've personally made a huge difference in dozens of people's lives simply by showing them a different point of view. 

I've also tried to help many people, until it became obvious they didn't necessarily want my help. Then I have to let go. It's difficult to determine which is which oftentimes. 

Opiates are a special danger. It's not actually clear what the friend was hooked on, but drugs like heroin and its like, or on the other side, crack cocaine or crystal meth, are demons I don't wish on anyone, or anyone's loved ones. 

But yeah. In the end I can't want someone to change more than they want to change. That's a losing proposition. Im starting to think you aren't really smart there guy. I wrote this one day at work while grieving, having no idea it would get as much attention as it did. i had no one to speak about it with, so i essentially wrote a memoir for myself, as a way to acknowledge my guilt, and express the way i felt the only way I knew how. If you think going into length about how shitty of a person I was to one of the best people I ever knew made me feel better, you're a fucking idiot. if anything, i wanted to tell a story that could potentially help anyone reading from making the same mistakes I did, and judging by the comments, I did just that. And yeah, that does make me feel better. Fuck off dudeSeriously, that's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking heard as far as helping an addict. Cops are not there to assist recovery, they will destroy the friends life. i hope the mods leave your response because to be honest it was the only one i really expected, there just happens to be a lot more understanding people on this forum then i ever would have imagined. i dont blame you for your views, they are accurate as shitty as i feel to say that. i would probably have the same reaction as you, i just wouldnt have taken the time to have written it outGood on you for sticking to your guns. Because you're right. Though I don't blame OP, and this doesn't mean he's a bad person. People hold grudges, people pass judgment, people grow apart. He's human. Respect to him for owning up and putting it all out there.

But that doesn't change the fact that you're right. Your words were harsh but true.  They want to hear the truth but not really.  They only want happy truths. Speaking the harsh truth is something people dont want to hear, because it makes them uncomfortable and its not PC.   
  
There is an overused cliche word that has lost its meaning over the last few years, but it is exactly the word for OP.  
  
**FAIL**.  OP literally failed ~~his best  friend~~ someone he was once friends with.
  
My condolences to the deceased, his family and those that were there for him.  
 
EDIT: Gilded for saying what people are afraid to say/hear.I get that you're grieving.  Just calling a spade a spade.  Hopefully someone does learn how not to be a friend like you. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 50 days clean, not homeless and got my dog back!, Content: , ups: 983, downs: 0I love the one in the back taking a very majestic leakStopping by from r/stopdrinking to say congrats!what state is this in? it looks really pretty.

Being reunited with your best friends.  Jack and Coke?You spelled dog wrongFeel you.  I remember.   I'm hittin 9 yrs next month if all keeps goin good. All it takes is one step in the right direction ,followed by another ,and one more , another one after that.   Start  please.   Love youGotta be a doppelganger unless you've spent some time in the upper midwest, went by KK occasionally and often traveled w/ a pooch named Remi.Are you just jealous or something?? Good on the Op for stopping by and letting some old friends know that she made it through. Prob the biggest accomplishment of her life. Regardless of where she posted this why would anyone ever hate on someone kicking addiction in the ass. OP, I'm super happy for you. This is not directed at
The OP and just a general statement but I find it attractive that a girl has the will power to get clean and also the open mindness to try opiates in the first place.
I've found this sub to be way more active than recovery and many people here even if using are supportive Good man, still clean and loving life. How about you? Im not jealous or anything like that, but I'm sorry dude watch this is post number 2 like this. In the next week or two we are about to be flooded by posts like this. I just dont think it belongs here, it's nothing personal against OP, honestly I'm proud of everyone who quits but still it's really not the place. 

I guess I'm the minority when it comes to having this opinion and if that's the case, it's the last time youll hear me bitch and moan about it lol.

No hard feelings dude?

Have a happy new year man!Totally I agree, I was wrong to say what I said in my original comment. I may not agree but I respect everyones decision, who am I to say what belongs here? I was wrong, should have kept my mouth shut if I had nothing nice to say.

Have a happy new year dude!Yea I guess my post had more venom than I meant it to. I see where you're coming from. Have a happy New Years man. I applaud you for replying to me in a mature manner, goes a long way in life. It takes a lot to admit you were wrong. Kudos to you!We are all family here as far as I'm concerned. Family, from time to time, will disagree/fight/argue about silly things. After reading your first comment dude, I kind of agree. If the majority of the community has no problem with these posts and likes seeing them then who am I to say it doesn't belong here. I have respect for everyone here and honestly there really is no harm in active or once active community members posting about their achievements whatever they may be. We support each other... I was wrong to say it doesn't belong here, because this isn't some bullshit dictatorship lol, plus we are all equal. My bad for my original comment, again didn't mean any disrespect and of course I'm happy to see one of us make it out of this shit.

Anywayyyyy, you doing anything special tonight????PS: Most of the time on reddit you need a little venom in your posts because most subs arent like this one. Lmfaooooo we where and still are an actual loving community compared to subs like wholesome memes. We are the OGs of that shit lol. Mad love for everyone here, across the board, you guys have lifted me up and helped got me through the hardest and most challenging times of my life. That is why I respect everyones downvotes on my original comment, that's everyone telling me, "yo dude chill, you are wrong here, take a step back and reevaluate your stance/opinon" On any other sub I would have gotten 10 pms and 10 replies telling me how Im such a piece of shit and all that, instead there's still love, doesn't matter about my differing opinion, you still talked to me pretty much as respectful as possible and I appreciate that man. I fucking love this place and everyone in it, hell I owe my life because of the way everyone here is. Haha this is pretty much the only hood where it's actually all good. And that's why i posted here. All this love. Its amazing. Plus i didnt know of the other sub. When i was thinking of being clean i looked on here for help and tips. I was hoping someone else who might be struggling could see this and get some hope from it.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Meanwhile outside of Purdue Pharma’s headquarters this morning..., Content: , ups: 953, downs: 0This is fucking, beyond brilliant.“People say [OxyContin snd Percocet] aren’t a big deal, but then you’re hooked and you run out of money and you turn to heroin.”

I can almost guarantee most people who switched to heroin wouldn't have done so if pills didn't blow up in price when they cracked down on them. At least when we were all doing them, we knew exactly wtf we were getting.

I'm not saying these pharma companies aren't evil, quite the opposite actually. They pushed oxycodone hard on the streets by making it so easy for doctors to prescribe it which got people hooked.  I wouldn't be surprised if the pharmacutical industry did all this because they knew that they had buprenorphine in their back pockets. That way they could keep making money off of addiction when their addicts decide it's time to get clean. 

This is all an obvious side effect of the good ol drug war. I wonder how quick they got a Whif of it before it was too late for it not to be a spectacle.Purdue is my bae. You like dilaudid original formula? Thank purdue.
You enjoy oxycontin? Big ups to purdue. 
Ever take senokot to relieve your stopped up ass from the OIC?
Gracias papi purdueFinally! One I won't accidentally knock over!This is fucking fantastic. Hopefully it gets some good coverage I'm the media.Ok but nobody is going to mention the giant amount of heroin in this spoon just lying there???Meanwhile people that have no other outlet for pain management need prescription opioids.omg I'm an idiot and I thought of Perdue chicken! I was trying to figure out the connection between chicken and drugs.Oh wow lol.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story,amp.html

He was arrested. Placing the sculpture was a misdemeanor charge, and refusal to remove it was a felony. I feel like placing the sculpture didn’t actually break any laws as evinced from the fact they didn’t actually say what the charge was, only that it was a misdemeanor. Purdue pharm hiring the local pigpen (police department) as their goons/muscle.

I could understand failure to comply and remove could be a felony. And that was probably their plan all along because the misdemeanor charge is fucking bullshit.Art imitates life!!Godzilla called, wants a front on a palette of dope.Made by Mr D. EspositoLMAO- now that is funnyBeautiful.This guy is beyond awesome. And he stood up for what he believes by that link. Hes A+ in my book.D.espositoHells yeahCan we get two 'hip hip hoorays'  for the artist!

I've never seen a more perfect piece of guerilla art. And his willingness to take a felony for the cause is awe inspiring.Thanks for posting this

(I also wonder if I could get a good cotton shot off that)Thank you Hooooly shit this is good. We need to go put one in front of every single Sackler property in the fucking world next. I don't think demonizing Purdue is very fair.This shit is great. Solid act of civil disobedience.Seems to me like he was simply trying to enjoy "freedom of expression", per Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Purdue would have done well to graciously thank him for his gift of art. Or perhaps they feel people who use their drugs would never end up using a spoon, yeah, that's it, couldn't happen.GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS! you cna shoot a whole bottle of 80s at once with that thingOhhh I get it now!
Thought it was another tide ad...We boof you faggg ass spoon...dope I. A syringe in my ass ....don't date about nothing Hate the company, loved their products.Upon first glance I thought for sure this was photoshopped. So very glad it's not. This really says a lot with no words necessary!Fuck yes!!!the corporations aren’t the problem imho... 
I’m capitalism every corporation has to maximize profits and keep up an endless growth... If someone won’t play after this rules their competitor will push them out of business. 
The problem is the whole system and/or the lack of regulations. Neat, this in Stamford, CT where I grew up.Legendary...I woulda anchored the damn thing to the ground, tooDude this is so incredible. I wish he woulda bolted it to the concrete so they woulda had a harder time removing it. Either way it’s possibly the best installation I’ve ever seen in my life.Kinda dumb. Unless his brother was one of the 1st patients prescribed the use of Oxycontin he would have known it's potential to be addicting. Thats on the user to keep using. None of us would blame a dealer for using and having an addiction because its on us. You can stop if you REALLY wanted. Would y'all be cool if he did this out side your dealers house?Because they forced everyone to take pillsas chronic pain suffering person, i cant justify blaming the people who make the drug, its the fucking law makers that are at fault (at this point) for restricting access to medications, purdue certainly plays a part, but i am extremely greatful for them making the drugs they do that allow me and millions of others to live, 

this is coming from someone who has committed suicide by heroin and lived after a 30 day coma... because my medication where abruptly stopped after a decade, people, especially my generation (im 30) really need to fucking take personal responsibility for what they do, the drug company didnt force you to snort that pill or shoot it, or eat it, they simply made it available for people with pain  those who fell in abuse/addiction because of the ease of access or however it came to be, thats a tragedy, but personal responsibility is above just blaming the people who make the shit... Roflrofl you soyboys are so pathetic. Youre whats wrong with america ironically.Thanks to all the people who cant take medication resposibly you have royally fucked all the chronic pain suffers. You chose to fuck yourselves up and have drug everyone down with you. This is F’ing epic, I wish I could of seen the faces of all the big wigs... Yes, totally brilliant! Especially since the Sackler family (of Purdue Pharma) are huge supporters of the arts. The north wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is named, “The Sackler Wing,” and there is also the Sackler Gallery, in Washington; the Sackler Museum, at Harvard; the Sackler Center for Arts Education, at the Guggenheim; the Sackler Wing at the Louvre; etc. 

It would be awesome is one of these could be dropped outside each of the institutions bearing their name. 

I already shared this link below, but their support of the arts makes this even more fantastic. 
[Empire of Pain]
(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) Wait though, what is he trying to say?  I feel like everyone is upvoting this because it’s cool to see a giant heroin spoon, but is he actually on our side?  I’m not sure I understand his message, so if someone would ELI5 I’d appreciate it. Old news. Buprenorphone isnt new. Been around a longggg time. So yeah, they set up the timeline so they could market it accordingly and make their dosh. No big secret.The point about buprenorphine is well taken especially if Purdue and reckitt benckiser have some back deal connectionBuprenorphine is still fully under patent ... and thanks to evergreening with new "improved" formulations will continue to be for quite some time.

Oxycodone (and all other classic narcotics) are at the very very tail end of the whole patent/evergreening process.  Awfully profitable little coincidence if you ask me...

Likewise most of the major players influencing this push against narcotic pain management have *major* stakes in large scale drug treatment programs ... like "Phoenix House".

Ever hear of PROP (physicians for responsible opiate prescribing)?  ...well all of their major stakeholders also own stakes in Phoenix House.

Everyone complains about Purdue's corruption and their role in the opioid crisis ... but the major players "fighting" against the opioids are engaged in *exactly* the same sort of unethical shady business.

The only difference is the shadiness on the part of the anti-opioid crusaders is hurting people with chronic intractable diseases ... while Purdue's actions hurt people using drugs illegally by choice.  In a lot of states there are actually laws on the books meant to ensure Pain patients receive ethical treatment from their doctors that are either being ignored and directly violated ... obv. there was never any expectation an addict would be treated with opiates for their addiction, but we have laws meant to ensure exactly that take place for the patients who need them.

Plus when you factor in the reality that this interventions against doctor and patients have actually had an extremely obvious negative effect on the targeted population ... the actions on the part of the anti-opioid fucks is just not in any way redeemable.  Not a chance did they play they long con of purposely getting addicts hooked. It was simple there was a massive untapped market of people who suffer daily from pain. In the past strong pain pills were not used for chronic conditions only end of life or short term like surgery. They already had the drug OxyContin they just had to aggressive advertise and market to doctors how safe it was and they were able to take over the market. And chronic pain is HUGE. Not just the number of people just your talking about having those people taking multiple pills everyday for life. If you get the market share which you did your ROLLING in money. 

They made there fucking money long ago and any lawsuits they face will never even come close to how much they made. I’m not sure but you can clearly see a police car pulled up in the background. I’m assuming they are somehow related. Minutes; possibly sub 60 secs.
What if i just like heroin.Senna's been used for over a thousand years for constipation. Just like oxycontin they took something that had been around for a while, changed it a bit and made a metric shit ton of money. Oh yeah and fighting in court so nobody could porduce their own version of the OG80 and left us with the OPs and NEOs yeah thanks purdue.  The drugs are produced by other companies than purdue all they do are patent and strangle the market.They are also co-promoting Symproic, which has a mechanism specifically for OIC.

But they aren't marketing it directly to consumers, cuz whoops we caused an opiate epidemic so gotta be carefulSo true lol..This!  I'm also the media and I agree. It definitely made the news, it’s been removed and apparently the gallery owner connected to the piece has been arrested and charged with both a misdemeanor and a felony. 

Here’s the link to the story. 

[link](http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story.html) Either you clearly don't use OC or you've literally never thought about your pills beyond ROA hahahaI hope they drop it down to like a littering charge so he doesnt catch a felony (if not just dropping it completely... Obv. that would be ideal.)

Instead theyll probably charge him with slandering the good name of our corporate overlords and have him executed for high treason. We probably should have just left it there and only claimed credit online... could have been out of the state by the time the police showed up.  Then arrange via phone to "have it removed" in a week or 2.The article OP linked says that the misdemeanor was for blocking their automotive pull-in area. Probably misdemeanor vandalism, could be littering, or one of those really broadly written laws like “disturbing the peace.”

Felony vandalism usually has to have a certain amount of property damage associated (like breaking stuff, or graffiti) and there’s not really any damage here. I wanna meet the dboy that will say nah to Godzilla. What is with people here not thinking Purdue is at fault. They single handled changed how doctors prescribed meds and did TONS of shady shit. They intentionally lied to sell pills and made billions. If my drug dealers can be held responsible then so should they. Only the OGs, unfortunately. Which we can't get here in the states anymore. At least not at a pharmacy. Kinda the opposite of hate the sin, love the sinner. This guy gets addiction. /sThey literally said it wasn’t addictive. They told doctors to prescribe it based on lies. 

It’s the same as big tobacco knowing cigarettes cause cancer and hiding it from the public. ## FDA requesting comment on opioid script crackdown hurting pain patients follow link and comment.

You can post anonymously. The FDA director has acknowledged that the misguided crackdown on legal/legitimate opioid scripts is going to far and hurting chronic pain patients.

[https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621)

They are requesting public comments on how this has impacted your or your families life. If you have chronic pain and have lost jobs, become suicidal, or turned to heroin because your prescriptions were taken away for absolutely no good reason other than the DEA and Sessions threatening doctors and pharmacists that are just trying to care for people..YOU NEED TO POST!!

Taking away people's in pains prescription's is inhumane, and it is doing absolutely nothing to stem the flow of heroin/fent into the USA, in fact its promoting it.username checks out..While demand is certainly there, you're right, a big part of the stigma and problem comes from drug diversion. If no one with a script EVER sold their pills for a profit, the problem woulsnt be as bad. There's enough blame to go around for the doctor and prescribed patient. You can't buy what no ones sellingTheir faces were the same as any other day.  You think they actually cared?His message is blaming Purdue and big pharma for over producing and lobbying for oversubscribing, causing the opiate crisis we are in now. Although many of us are addicts on this sub, we don't support addiction, and hope we all can find a way to lead happy healthy lives, whether that be with drugs or not.But it's still under patent and will be for quite some time. Thank Bayer.Well yeah, of course Purdue didn't invent senna, they just marketed and branded senokot. Aleve didn't invent naproxen, etc. Indeed oxycodone was invented in Germany in 1916. It was actually originally thought to be a non-addictive alternative to heroin. But they quickly worked out it wasn't even back then.

All Purdue did was stick a time release on it, get a patent for that, lie about its addictive potential, and cash in on overprescription.We are all the media this blessed dayare you fucking kidding me, a felony for leaving an art piece out in public? Can we at least pretend like we still have a fair justice system and only charge him with the misdemeanors that he would have been charged with had he left this in front of a business less wealthy and influential?Wow really shows you who's in charge. That's sad. Well, I'm from Maryland. If you know Md, then you know we have to drive through Delaware, where a lot of Perdue chicken farms are when we visit the beach. I goto the beach a lot. 

I used to fuck with OC but now I fuck with fent and regular dope. I really only use fent now because it doesn't show up on my drug tests in my drug program as long as I don't use 24 hours before. My dealer swears up and down its undetectable, but I still give it 24 hours and pass each time.It will be bargained down, also Pharma will drop the charges.The article says that the felony was for refusing to remove it. The gallery owner stood and chatted with police while waiting for the summons, but refused to remove it.  This was calculated though. He and the artist had already decided ahead of time but he was going to take the criminal charges.He knew what he was getting himself into, but he’s passionate enough about this that he wanted to send a message.i blame the mental health crisis and the gov't not doing enough to address itI only ever had the change to try one once, it was only half so 40mg shot.  at least i can say i tried the original OCs.  My friend that i taught how to shoot up was the one that split it with me.  Hes dead now from a fent/H od.  

alshtough he was the type of guy that would shoot 10 blues within the span of an hour so i pretty much knew it was gonna happen sooner or latter.Ok smart ass.  I just visit this sub cause I ran out of other things to read on the internet.Good example with Tabacco. It’s not that they made they product it’s that they lied in the interests of money with no care of the damage it may cause. thats the main issue, the misinformation that is spread like wild fire, worse than wild fire, it literally over takes peoples idea of what one thing is or is not, its like if you had an orange and a bullet, and they said "these are two oranges" and people where like "well the guy said its an orange so it must be...."  its a total fuck fest to say the least, but still, today, last 5-10 years, people need to talk responsibility for what they do, they know whats what when it comes to opiates, its been a mainstream thing for along time nowThats a huge part of it I still can't understand... so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades prior to OC's arrival, oxycodone, is somehow going to not be addictive due to them adding a time release coating!? I feel they cared mainly about getting all the perks for prescribing drugs for perdue that they overlooked the facts. Yeah but that also comes down to socio economic problems. I’ve know inter city poor people who sold their script because it was either they have there pain meds or they had a place to sleep and had to make a tough choice. Supply and demand.... and it almost just being normal human behavior. I mean we have been doing opiates for thousands of years... There will always be a demand and someone will supply it or find a way to get/make something hitting the same receptors..Who cares if they cared?

It's still awesome.They really don't care. Do U?Buprenorphine? The brand name patent is expired, there's plenty of generics....tons...History on point. A+Perdue deserves a little props for the new age heroin userThe felony charges won't stick. They can try to charge you with anything remotely similar to a broken law, doesn't mean any of that shit will stick. Probably get some 'illegal dumping' charge. The article explains it a little bit.

>	The spoon was placed in an automotive drop-off spot, making the path unusable. The placement of the sculpture was the misdemeanor charge; refusal to remove it resulted in the felony charge.

>	The interactions between Alvarez and police were cordial. While waiting to issue the summons, the gallerist and the cops chatted amiably about civic matters and the opioid epidemic.

>The sculpture, named “Purdue,” was made by Boston-based artist Domenic Esposito, who was present at the time of the sculpture drop. Esposito was not charged or arrested. He said before the art drop that he and Alvarez decided who would take the criminal charges.

I don’t know, that sounds kind of fair I guess. He knows what he was getting himself into by refusing to move it.  

Unfortunately it doesn’t matter if you’re fighting for a good cause, the downside of an illegal protest is that it’s illegal. They tend to make more headlines than organized legal protests, so in *that* way, they are more effective.  The legal consequences are just the price that you pay.  

The criminal charges actually do show that you are passionate enough about your cause to take a hit to spread awareness.  That definitely sends a message that gives fire to your movement.  All in all, even with the charges, I would imagine that he considers his protest a success.

Haha oh I know Perdue chicken to, its just with OC being about the most famous drug of all time, and Purdue being wildly notorious even amongst non drug users it's funny your mind went there. I meant no disrespect nor was I trying to imply you were an idiot for saying thatThis is the problem with things like this. There’s literally too many things that can be the cause of something. There are dozens of contributors. 

I need to look up the number but mental health is something we massively need to invest in. Every dollar we spend we save something like 3$ on incarceration. We can do so much more. We aren't monkeys in a cage. Feel free to browse this sub and comment all you want. But don't be surprised when you get called out on your "addiction is a choice" bullshit. > so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades...

[yes.](https://youtu.be/Er78Dj5hyeI) Right... sorry but if someone put a big azz H spoon outside your HQ the reaction would be priceless.and that’s why suboxone exists Wait, so what's his point exactly though? Do people really think the opioid epidemic is the fault of pharmaceutical companies? 

I can understand how non-users might think that, but for people familiar with addiction it just seems... naive.hahha my mind is just on the beach and I have to go by perdue farms when I go there. I wasn't trying to imply you were being disrespectful haha. But I am an idiot either way lolThis 'opioid epidemic' a good portion (maybe majority?) of these people are self-medicating with opiates for an untreated psych. issue because our mental healthcare system has failed themJust stop. So everytime you get high its been against your will? Developing an.addiction isn't a choice butnusing the drugs that lead to that addiction is a choice. Saying its.not takes all the responsibility off the addict and encourages them to.pmay the victim. People will never get clean with that mindset. Ive been there. I shot up heroin for 5 years. I get it. I.made a choice to stick that needle in my arm. I also made a choice to stop.Absolutely.  Oh to have been able to see *anyone's* reaction to it would have been so, damn amazing.

Someone say spoon?overprescribing opiates, which big pharma lobbied for A LOT, is the main reason for the opioid epidemic. Most heroin addicts today started on pills. The companies purposefully did little to nothing to detect fraud and misuse of their product. They marketed and produced them in ways that caused more addiction potential. They only started making them non-injectable in response to pressure from society. Its fucked up.I believe that my addiction is my own fault. However Purdue is very much at fault for allowing the supply of pills. Just like I don’t blame heroin addiction on the cartel I choose to pick up that bag but they should still be held responsible for their end. 

Mainly what Purdue did wrong was aggressively advertise to doctors that they had an extremely safe low addiction potential product. Which the data they used to support this was fabricated. There aggressive advertising didn’t just push their product but they supplied entire literature  for classes centered around managing pain. They changed they way in which doctors thought to treat pain which heavily relied on opiates. And whether or not you believe this is a good medical  decision know that they didn’t do this for pain patients but rather to sell more product. 

What they did was sketchy and bad in so many areas. Ultimately the addict needs to be responsible for their choices but so do the suppliers for actively making money while  deceiving doctors and the public 
This is an excellent piece that paints a clear picture of Purdue Pharma and the “Opioid Crisis” they created, through means of subversion, lobbying, targeting poor communities and paying doctors to lie-in order to get Oxycontin into the hands of millions of trusting patients, desperate for relief from chronic pain. 

Fm the Article in the New Yorker, ‘Empire of Pain:’
“According to training materials, Purdue instructed sales representatives to assure doctors—repeatedly and without evidence—that “fewer than one per cent” of patients who took OxyContin became addicted.”

[The Family That Built an Empire of Pain The Sackler dynasty’s ruthless marketing of painkillers has generated billions of dollars—and millions of addicts]
(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) 

*sorry for format-on shit mobilePriceless to see those greedy CEO big wigs no doubtI’d much rather regulated companies flat out sell opioids to addicts then forcing them on the black market to buy unknown..[This article](http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/) is really good too.

Oh and [this one](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/) about Purdue's current expansion into developing markets like China: "we're only just getting started."

Funny thing, even though the UK is not exactly a developing market it's also not really been a target market for Purdue since the NHS is much stricter about scripting opiates than the US healthcare system, but recently Shorttec and Longtec scripts have suddenly gone up and they've become available on the black market too. Those are brand names for oxycodone. The company that makes them is called Qdem. The parent company of Qdem is Mundipharma. The parent company of Mundipharma is Purdue. Agreed. But they can’t lie to everyone saying the opiates cause addiction in less than 1% of cases. Then when it is proven they lied they should pay 

But agreed the way things were in the pill mill days were much safer than they are now Yeah that is the real ethical problem imo. I think many of us can agree the war on drugs is a failure. Regulated markets are better than black markets.

However, selling drugs to druggies who know what they're getting into is different from lying to patients about how dangerous a medicine is.

People trust doctors, and corruption by Purdue lead to this trust being abused. A lot of people got hooked on opiates because doctors acted like pushers and those people would not have gone anywhere near smack otherwise. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😂, Content: , ups: 922, downs: 0Hahaha good one. My old ass hates itit wasn’t the 90’s, but when i was a senior in high school in 2008, i was doing oxy 80’s (the old, better ones that u could just break up so easily) and even sometimes i could get the old 160 mgs. anyways, that and opana and everything else. then one day my friend got some fent patches and was like just suck on this patch. i was like “that sounds retarded, sucking on a piece of paper to get well”. now look at me 10 years later, literally putting pieces of suboxone paper under my tongue everyday. lol.YIKES!I literally love this post. It finally makes me feel understood, and included. I’m a young, newer opiate user who started with fentanyl less than a year ago, and it ruined classic opiates for me. I never got to enjoy oxys or heroin.Golden �Haha funny and trueThis is a good oneBahahaha ���..                   nm.Fentanyl is a damn good painkiller. I would love to be put on a patch.i love this memeYeah I miss that era of my use too. Around 2007-2011. Back when I could semi afford a pill habit of OC, dilaudid and oxynorphones. For some reason too no one ever knew how cheap they were selling the dilaudids and opanas and would get them cheap as fuck like .10-.25 bucks a mg. Even OC was very max .50 a mg and that was like full retail price.That fuckin sucks homie !This is what pisses me off when people want to show off their drug dick and brag how they went straight to snorting heroin or IVing right off the bat in their opiate consuming career.

&#x200B;

Its DUMB, noobs should start with codeine or tramadol because if you go straight to the hardest shit your tolerance is ruined, you miss out on that honeymoon period where you can use cheaper easier to find shit occasionally.

&#x200B;

Its like joining some public bisexual orgy for your first sexual experience, its dumb! Enjoy the small things first.I feel bad for you.i think i used to pay like $10 for an 80mg when i’d buy them in bulk back then. but then it went up to $15, then $20, then finally $25. by then i had moved on to H and then methadone. I had to go to a methadone clinic basically every day. that shit sucked after a while. It’s nice how easy it is to get suboxone prescribed where i live now, especially if u really need it. but honestly, i totally miss how cheap and simple things were back in those days.Yeah, it really does suck for people who can’t enjoy it the way I do. I have such a romantic love for fentadope bags ��Um, somebody offered me what they had. What, was I supposed to tell them to go fetch me oxys? Shits are expensive, I’m not about to be picky about free drugsI agree. I started on codeine and got a good high on 15mg. I spent a year climbing the codeine ladder until it did jack. Then I went onto oxycodone. Nearly 3 years later, 10mg is still a decent dose that’ll help pain. I’d probably need 20mg to get high.I don’t. Oxys are so fucking expensive.Nah bro it sucks that you started up using in the era of Fentalogues... Fentanyl doesn’t hold a candle to Oxymorphone, at least not for me... with fent it always felt like a short lived body load with not near as much euphoria. To each their own I guessYou got high on 15mg of codeine?My first opiate experience was IVing hydromorphone, I think it was something like 3-4 mg. Needless to say it blew away so hard. That first rush experience with the best rush opiate of any is amazing. But now I don’t really enjoy anything else except maybe some decent H if I can get my hands on some ( very rarely). 

Here in Eastern Canada the most common opiate and by far the most available is hydromorphone, it’s hard to find anything else.

I agree with what you said however. I wish I had started with Oxys or something and worked my way up like a normal junkie ruining her life. 

It’s hard to pass the needle once you know how it feels and how easy it is to prepareDidn’t used to be. I was getting a 100 pack of blueberries in 2008 for 320$. OC80s you could get 50 for 300 and this was even cold copping prices in the major north western city. 

When I heard roxi 30s were fucking 30-45$ street price now I couldn’t believe who would pay that when you could get a gram of good heroin for that price, that was 2012ish. Oxymorphone and gel fent patches kinda fucked up the game and then the crack down, and reload of really good cheap dope. 

Now Good luck getting dope without a RC in it, and it’s like 80/g. I was getting fingers of Fire ECP for 260 as recently as 2017 

Been off opiates since 2017 so i could potentially be unaware of somethingI agree with you wholeheartedlyI no joke dreamed about oxymorphone last night. Christ I miss itI loved popping ten oxycodone and being lit for a day.Yeah, but it’s not like I know what I’m missing. It’s just a generation gap. I’d love to try dillies and pandas, but they’re so expensive in comparison. And short legs is advantageous. I’ve survived so many overdoses, and I can get high anytime, because I’m sober within the hour.Initially, yes. It was more like a buzz.I pay $140 for a bundle of “heroin” which is just bags of fentadope that I love. I’ll mAre you yeezusWow, livin the dreamAh right, you must metabolize it really well. I'm at the stage where i'm taking 500mg or so daily, and it doesn't do shit anymore. Gonna have to get on the dark net and find something better i suppose.Yeah, just like the rest of you opiate addicts on here.Definitely the dream lmao�[removed]Get off your high horse m8

Edit: Relevant UsernameThanks for the advice dude, i'd take every precaution if I started getting stuff on the dw, the risk is what keeps me away.We don't allow specific markets or vendors to be named here.What high horse? I’m not allowed to enjoy my own god damn drug of choice without having everybody talk shit about it, saying “oh that sucks for you”It is so funny that a subreddit of fucking heroin addicts can't let someone do whatever the fuck they want.  Actually hilarious how delusional they are, you do you bro.  Be safe. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Revenge Hack, Content: , ups: 906, downs: 0No no no, destroy your life with drugs, feign getting clean, get your ex-back, relapse and ruin both of your life's..... Bonus points if you can trick your ex to get on dope after the relapse.Damn, this made me sad. Y’all hang in there. You can beat the pain. Seems impossible, but I promise it is not. Hahahaha �That's what I did to Church Girl. [deleted]Dam this hits home :’(Damn this turned out to be way more controversial than it should have been. Genius Fuck! I relate to this to much!It’s unfortunately meDam this hits close, my drug use got pretty fucking bad when my ex broke up with me I can’t imagine what a divorce would do to meHAHAHA REKTTTTI am one step ahead of youThis happened to me lolToo relatable lolYes because people who take drugs are really beneath contempt, let's keep that trope going. Can we have a bit more racism and sexism in here as well, please?noIt was just a joke dudeWhile I agree, pretty sure all of us know this already. Therefore it's a bizarre and funny joke.LolYou’re a beast metroFeel for you dude been in that same boat at least twice In society, they absolutely are. Whether you like that or not, that’s the truth. So I’m not sure why your point is here. No. No it’s not. The joke is, it’s not a joke ...The point being that we ought to make the attempt to understand why people take drugs instead of persecuting them. That's difficult and expensive and it's the same reason why mental health provision in general is so poor. Great advances have been made in the field of physical health but mental health lags significantly. It remains a taboo subject amongst suffers, nobody is declaring that they have mental health issues, you would be unemployable at the very least.You don't seem to understand what the phrase "beneath contempt" means. You just agreed that addicts are beneath contempt. You are trying to express that society *sees* addicts as *worthy of contempt.* Yeah, it is. It’s about revenge. They’re using it as way to get back at the person who dumped them. The joke being that it’s a very extreme length to go to just to get revenge on that person. Ummm, do you get it?Funny... I still laughedPerhaps the best way to bring attention to the subject is with comedyR/wooooshI think you're just shitfaced, sir. Do you get it dude? Lol That is usually a very effective tool.Perhaps a meme even??I kinda feel like the exact same thing should be said to you lolI was being sarcastic though lolShould have added an /s cause nothing about the way your comment comes off sounds in any way sarcastic at all...You are getting downvoted lol, it was a sarcastic comment on how yes it’s staged as a joke but it has real life altercations to people a lot of the time. Lmao lol I’m getting downvoted - by you - 2 downvotes. Oh no, better close my account!
See, THATS sarcasm � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I did a thing!, Content: , ups: 905, downs: 0I used to be an active member of the opiates community. I was on opiates for 10 years, IV heroin at the end of it. From a low bottom hopeless homeless rotten scumbag like me, it truly does get better. Shoutout dejaGood work man. I'm day 29 and spazzing tf out. Cant quit thinking about dope.Congratulations!  You're one strong willed person.  I wish you the best in your future endeavors!  Fucking love me some Brand New. �������������Congratulations!!! That is great news to see someone succeed. Awesome.I'm only at 5 months man haha, congrats. Takes some real will power.Amazing! How'd you do it!? 

&#x200B;Congrats fam. 8 months hereIs that image from déjá entendu?Coming from someone who is mostly a lurker around here and a momma of an addict who lost his battle in June...... I have tears in my eyes when I tell you how happy and excitedI am for you!!!  I wish for you a beautiful life. Congratulations I'm nearly 10 months, and you're my inspiration. Your phone background helps.1000 days and approx $40k in savings... you did remember to put all your would-be dope money in a savings account, didnt you? 




I know I sure didnt. Congrats dood. Congratulations! I’m very happy for you. Wow that’s amazing, I wish I had your strength. You just gave me the inspiration to resist my craving for the night. HOLY MOLY MACKEREL CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!Brand New?Iv been on opiates for 13 years now mainly methadone, im so tied of this feeling i just want my life back. Im reducing so hopefully next year will be the year i get off it fingers crossed.Love your wallpaper. Congrats! Congratulations!Contrary to my username, Daisy is actually one of my favorite albums of all timeWord my favorite bandUhm, what’s that app you’re using? And looks cool, only thing that Bothers me is how the white font on the bottom kind of blends in with the background a bit. Congratulations! ��This is a big step to reach.  Hopefully you can convince others to 
join you.
Great work dude! Proud of you for this feat!Congrats. Legit having that deja entendu art tattooed on my leg in two weeks Dolor hic proderit olim. <3What app is this Congratu-fucking-lations
It's always good to see people who have pulled out of this. Gives me inspiration I might as well someday.You got out just as fent was about to get really bad. That decision might have saved your life!Congrats. Going on 9 months here. You are truly an inspiration!Your one of the best in my book! I'd rather hire a guy like you who has been through hell and comeback alive then 100 other guys that have had an easy go. God Bless you man. Congrats...I used to work with a guy who was a ex-heroin addict. Now he runs a multi-million dollar company and brings in north of 500k /year home.Oh man. 2 years since I touched fentanyl. Overdoses... Dying from withdrawal seizures and dehydration.

I still feel like ass,but I feel way better. Went to rehab and everything. I couldn't do anything I wanted to die, but I got put in some psychiatric hospital because I told the doctor that. 

2 years later I'm better. All started with taking my grandma's vicodin (she didn't use them or wanted to, she threw them and I took it) don't know why she'd buy them anyways. You can deny a script. 

Then to Norco, oxy, tar heroin... Fent (first hit, OD) and continued fent for months despite almost dying. 


And these DEA. FDA people wanna get rid of Kratom but not shit like vicodin that dentist tried to give me but I refused and felt good about it.

Kratom basically is like a weak opiate feel but it's different. It's energetic for me. When I stop, I can still function. I just get stomach issues.

Not saying to try kratom either in just mad cause I've been informed about the lies FDA and shit are spreading.

Well, congrats to staying clean.Blessings to you! ��Thank you brother. May life bless youI was lucky enough to see them do the devil and god all the way through in 2016 before the shit hit the fan. Deja still has a big place in my little grinch heart though. It started getting better for me around 60 days. Once I got over that hump everything started making sense. Up until then, though, it was nearly constant. I was lucky, I got to go to long term treatment. AmenDon’t say “only” - give yourself some credit! I’m sure it took work to get there. Slowlyyyyyyyy. No but for real I went to a 90 day treatment program, a halfway house, and lived at a sober living house for 15 months before I let myself experience the real world. I’m an active member of AA and have a home group, sponsor, and good friends who support me. It is I’m very sorry to hear about your son. It’s not the same but I lost my best friend in July and can’t imagine what it would be like to lose a child. Occasionally a using thought will pop into my head and the first person I think of is my mom. Again, I’m so so sorry for your loss. Back when I was active I used to kind of idolize you; it’s an honor to be on the other side. If I had saved it all I’d have over a hundred grand according to the app. Unfortunately I don’t have that much but I have a positive balance in my account and a paycheck that keeps coming every two weeks with no threat of being taken away anytime soon!Yes sir or ma’am It’s called Sober Time. I picked the background photo so you could always choose something that fits better with the whiteSober Time, you can choose your own background photo Oh believe me, it did. I overdosed on fentanyl three times in one week before I stopped. Girl, but thank you all the same! I work in the treatment field now and it’s really cool getting to help people like me. Goddamn, think about how much heroin he could buy.I’m a girl! But thank you all the same. Saw that same tour with modern baseball and tfb  that show was epic came to see if anyone recognized the background, and quickly my heart sank after reading this comment because i’d sell my kidney to see the devil & god are raging inside me live. fuck id kill to see them live at all but now i sadly probably never will � (still clinging to hope they’ll someday soon at least do a reunion tour)I also saw their anniversary tour in 2016 where they played the whole record! At the time I was disappointed there was no new record for the show, but TDAG is my all time favorite album and seeing it front to back live was basically a religious experience for me.

And I got to see them play science fiction the next year anyways :)Thanks, I appreciate the kind words.Glad to hear it bro-  thats a solid gameplan and I'm a big advocate of sober living/halfway. Well thank you.  As my heart heals I intend to find ways to honor him and get his story out there.  It can be so discouraging but then there are stories like yours that remind me that there can be freedom and there are happy endings.  Keep killing it.  You are awesome Who is he that you idolized him? I recognize the user name but is there something I’m missing, like is he internet famous or something? Lol This is inspiring and priceless, really. Congratulations to you and keep up the positive attitude and hard work ~ you're doing so well!I have that astronaut tattooed all over my arm!Love your choice! It’s Daisy and Deja, right?!how do you help?Lol.... I think.Is it bad that was my first thought, probobly but whatever.That’s the one! I went to the show in CT. I feel the saaaameYou just learn who certain people kind of are when they have a recognizable username and post here often. Sometimes to the point of feeling like you know someone.I do intakes and admissions and I’m a counselor internIt's your cake day, you're allowed to think bad thonks on cake day.Haha same me tooI was going to respond but you got it. Exactly this. how did you get into it?YES!Nice. That venue was really cool. A couple of my friends from my old home group have various jobs at the rehab I work at, and once I had 2 years and a spot opened up they let me know and I went for it!Yeah the oak dale is pretty nice. Congrats on getting clean man, big ups to you When I was in an in-house detox for heroin, the people who helped the most were the counselors who had been addicts. They didn't miss a thing and I still remember their advice. They were a million times more spot on than the psychiatrist who you hardly ever saw anyway.

Well done and good for you helping others. No one is more qualified. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Yuh, Content: , ups: 887, downs: 0One time this dude asked me to swing by to drop off, but his family was visiting his house. Ok no prob, I said, I'll just leave it on top of the tire of your car or in your bushes. I pull up a there's an old man literally right outside staring at the street?? I park in front of the next house on the street, the old man is his dad who went outside to make a phonecall. I'm thinking okay lmao now what, so I get out of the car and shove the shit up the neighbor's rain pipe on the side of their house, get in my car and look up and see the neighbor in their fucking living room staring out the windows, behind the blinds, at me. I tell the guy where I left it and gtfo lmao"So this is the friend we've heard so much about... Like a plate? The wings are hot off the grill!

You want what, exactly? All flats? 

*slowly begins scratching head*

Flats... coming right up... Excuse me moment, if you would."

*walks inside, unlocks phone*

"Ok Google, what part of the chicken is flat?"






Sooo like all Dominicans & puerto ricans in the boston area? haha

Shit bro.. I’m puerto rican and i think its hilarious. dumb assess stick out like sore thumbs Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent 'ya! Damn spitting imagine of one of my dudes lmao. And he would do that too hahahaha.Ill always upvote dipsetOr when u pull up to meet ur plug and he has a custom bright ass burn-ur-retina paint job w/26" sprewell's... "I'm sure no one knows what just went down bro.... We r good".. lolThe whole byrd gangs in here AYI would rock this get up.Holy fuck I copped a few grams at a quinceanera one time. Was the only white dude, was hilarious. its funny cuz i pretty sure julez just got in trouble for gun and 8 blue berrys in his bag when he was trying to catch a flight. 
Its all fun and games until your uncle walks up to the plug and they know each other lol So pathetic, needing to buy your next high while at a family cookout. Free max b[deleted][deleted]What’s flat?Wait wait, who fucking grills flats and drumsticks? If youre grilling wings they better be whole from rib to tip and slathered in chiavettas, if theyre broken down you should be frying them like mama bellisimo intendedMy Lawrence dboys �Shit I wish Juelz was my dealer. Thats correct, saw it on NORE's show.Never understood drug dealers like that. Either don't respond or give an accurate time frame wtf is the point of lying or being annoying if it's someone trying to give you their moneyOh no cuz if it’s bunk you’re just trying to get free shit! Lol I had one dealer I guess who would always talk shit behind my back. Look I know a lot of people let you short them and fuck them over but I have never been that chick. I’ll say something every fucking time til I’m going somewhere else. 

It’s extra awesome when they think you need them. And when you haven’t seen them all weekend they’re calling you asking if “you alright.” Psht too late bitch!So true!!The flat part of the wing...not the drumstick aka the best part!Chiavettas! I see you're from the East coast.Caspar MilquetoastI got into a heated fight with a woman who was middling for me over this. She would always tell me she had what I needed, but after 6 hours of dicking me around it would become clear that she never had it, and she was just trying to string me along until she had it. She was desperate for her cut of the dope.

Another kid I bought from for a while straight up told me, "you've gotta make em wait to remind the customers of their place". Fuck that guy.Because if they say they arent ready you will just look somewhere elseQft!!!   I have a guy that delivers and I'll call at 5pm,me- "yo dude, can u roll thru?". Him-"Yup, I'm just going to stop get some gas and Ill that way"
Me-"ok bro thx, I appreciate it". Hr and a half later, I call back, me-" hey man just making sure ur still rolling thru" 
Him-" yup I got u, I'm heading that way now".  He lives about 15/20mins away. It's now 715, I text- "u getting close by?? "Him- yup passing ##### street now omw".  It's now 8:20, I hit him back one more time, he answers sounding aggrevated, "yeah",. Me-"just making sure u are still coming this way?". Him- " I told u I'm omw". Just about perfectly the amount of time it takes for him to get to me from his crib from then he shows up.  I mean fuck I've even tried to b like yo man can u roll thru, I'll grab my regular.. and if u can't get here for a lil it's cool, just lmk... Naw man, I'll b there asap...3-1/2 hrs later, he shows... On the bright side, allot of times he "hooks it up" for making me wait.... So I know he understands the concept of time... Apparently just doesn't grasp the idea of conveying that info my way...I've had about a dozen solid connects, and that theme holds true for every one of them!I know this isn the same but when I was selling nug in college and I remember when I started I would be super punctual and give people accurate time frames because I mean the shit sells itself you just roll through and grab the cash. After a year or so I remember getting super lazy about it and would get annoyed when people would hit me up all the time.  It was mostly annoying when these people I wasn’t friends with hit me up and I had to drop what I was doing. I can imagine selling harder drugs the people annoy you more and the hours are even more fucked. Then I got hooked on dope and I guess karma happened cuz I had such a SHITTY middle until I got introduced to my boy running a trap. [deleted][deleted]It's a way to keep you from going to the backup dope boy. I'l lbe there in 5 keeps you from going somewhere else Seriously...dont they want to make money??I had a dealer who I would weigh his product every time cause his runners were dumbasses who skimmed bags every once in a while and he loved that I told him when it was weak or missing even like .05 on a quarter. He would always replace product missing taking my word for it (since I actually never lied amazingly enough) and if it was fucked up stuff where maybe the runner cut it he would throw me extra too usually "uncut". Best dealer I ever had, got to watch him move up from running around in his beat up subey with his gf to having 3-5 runners making bank so he always treated me well. [deleted][deleted]I didn’t know that was what it was called but the flat is my favorite part. Yeah, baby!Yup, and more meat too. Western NY, i know my wings.I've heard the remind the junkie of their shit place in the world before and was blown away. Like really your gonna play the holier than thou card dealing dope?[deleted]Fine then, look somewhere else if you want to pay more rather than wait, but I know they'll be back eventually. I always try to work in the customers best interest, and if that interest is someone else selling for double my price then so be it lmfao At least he comes through. Today for example we spoke at 11:45 I call at 4:45, twice and get chewed out for “blowing him up while he’s doing family shit”. & then says he’s turning off his phone after me trying to explain that there’s no way I could know that. Um excuse me, then why did u say u were on the way at 11:45.... fucking ridiculous. I HATE every dboy I know it’s pathetic. All depends on his mood.Yeah it's annoying, especially since I work crazy long, weird hours at a real job too, but st the end of the day I remember that money is money, and I need money.Damn. Where do you live that does deliveries? If someone's gonna go low enough to roll on one of their dealers to try and escape the consequences of their own fuck-up, wouldn't they rather roll on one of their less reliable dealers rather than their #1 connect?I'm lowkey enough already that there's no way anyone is gonna roll up my name tbhI don't really care if they end up going to someone else tbh lmao. I already know I've got the cheapest, if you'd rather pay double the price for someone who's just gonna yank your chain for 5 hours like everyone else rather than wait 3 hours for me to get off work and serve you promptly then uhh that's your choice lolThey always do, but sometimes you let your personal feelings of being inconvenienced and annoyed of being taken out of something you're currently doing get in the way. The bigger you are the more likely you are to get those feelings That’s fucking awesome, you the real OG my dude!shit most the h aint even real h these days... its all chemicals and bullshit. Theyd rather mix 10 different analogues together and call it h then just get some real h... seems like a much bigger hassle having to acquire all that shit but I guess they just blinded by profit margins sadly. Sucks cuz all the old heads who actually care about running a good business and keeping custies happy are all leaving the game or dying off leaving all these idiots who only see dollar signs to take their place and the product goes from being 7/10 or better all day to, "lets play who can guess whats in my dope and how strong it is today..." ranging from bunk to OD. Brap brap! Can't say specific locations but I'm living quite near a place famous for wings.It's really troubling how high and mighty a little power over others makes some people.It’s hilarious to me how so many of them act like they are your lifeline. Don’t forget bitch, you’re working for me! You don’t come correct, I’m gone. And then of course if they haven’t seen you all week they’re asking where you are. I hired someone else mofo peace! 

Ugh you know last week I drove my connect who is on house arrest to see his P.O. this mother fucker had the nerve to say to me after driving for 2 hours “I’m on a time limit, you ain’t!” Excuse the fuck out of me? I have a life and that whole not respecting my time but demanding me to respect yours, that don’t fly with me. Haven’t seen his bitch ass since. I really cannot stand those types. Hate to break it to you, but I really don’t need your ass.Damn you sound like such a cool person! I wish you were my connect.This is true, I have 3 on rotation just for those occasions..lol. let's c how long they get irritated for calling them back hrs later when we stop calling em back:).Exactly, i don't know where unRare lives but where i'm at if you're a piece of shit you get flipped, if you're good and give extras though, credit and all that, nobody even dreams of talkingI completely agree with Project.  If the guy is gonna rat I think he gives up the connect that treats him the worstYeah that'd be really fucking stupid for anyone to roll on whoever has the lowest prices. Roll on the one with the highest with the shittiest product lmfao Dude no if u ppl just keep ur mouths SHUT when/if u ever get caught up and either comply with the police or have a sure way to escape, u will all get into less trouble duh cuz u want at least evidence against u as possible.  They can’t just go on ur phone but need to have a passcode on it and I’ve been charged with 4 sales/etc felonies a few years ago and got caught with over 50 gs of h and a bunch of different other shit, 4 phones, 2 scales but I kept my friggin mouth shut and it all got dropped after about a year and a half.  This was in Cali tho and I did have a private attorney Maybe I'm the only one who has had paranoid, rude connects. I agree it's silly, the reason I got sober was because how annoyingly hard it was to score good dope. Routinely waiting hours in my car after getting a location. You got it right though, just find that rare in my part. Poppin' OCs from the Florida pill mills and shooting real dope for 10 years without a taste of fent til just last month when I relapsed. I feel like an old man in a young persons game now. Getting back on track right now with a week clean. I don't think I can survive any longer but I have the motivation to stay clean even if it's just cause I want to be able to tell those youngsters about the good ol' days in the opi game. Same here. Of course all the famous places have crappy wings ;)Just look at Reddit mods anyplace but here lol. Or HOAs. Or mall rent a cops. Anything with the slightest hint of power can go straight to a mofos headTheres more than one popsicle stand in town. See I feel like once I get a little older and don’t have like real responsibilities and shit that I’m probably gonna just completely go Head first. My bf and I will sell our house, buy a tiny house, and travel and get high lol. Who knows, I just feel like if I’m in a good place I will probably fuck it all up.

And shit, you get clean for any damn reason you want! Lol gosh I really couldn’t imagine how much different shit is now compared to them. I know a lot of people get fent but personally where I’m at it’s pretty scarce luckily. Of course the dope is most likely not as good as it was when you were on your run, but I do love me some tar. Whatever you choose to do, I hope life treats you well! Much love!!I feel you and wish sometimes for that but there would still be sick days and my family would hate me and I'd pick up more felonies and I'd hit a hot shot and die. Luckily my real run was all powder cause just in my little relapse my veins have failed me from the tar. Hope whatever path you choose treats you well and maybe some day you'll want to get clean and if not just please be careful and don't die on us. Love right on backI’m lucky enough to be 5 years in and still not on the needle. I’ve been completely functioning, but my boyfriend has been using weekends and in the last couple months he’s really lost control. So I guess it’s time to quit. I’ve never let heroin take anything from me, but just in the last 2 weeks every single bill has been completely behind now. Worries me, that’s for sure! Would hate to have a drug ruin my relationship but I’ve never been the type to lose it all for a substance. Luckily I’ve been able to maintain some sort of control.

And I think you’re doing the right thing. Losing your family I’m sure is horrible, so definitely keep up how you’re going. Good luck fam! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: The real MVP, Content: , ups: 888, downs: 0It is illegal for them to open your mail without a warrant, (UPS and fed ex can open if they have reasonable suspicion, although average employees cant open them, they just send them up the chain). If they happen to break open and there are drugs everywhere or obviously visible, then they will send it to their security department and give it to the police. 

I worked for UPS as a manager at one of the largest hubs in the country and have good friends at the post office. We covered this kind of shit in my management training and the head of security for our hub, (who is a corparate higher up dude), told us that the major mail carriers know that they ship millions upon millions of dollars worth of drugs every year and its not really an issue for them. I mean at the end of the day, thats lots of money for them and its not their responsibility to determine if the packages are legal or not.... They, (and the feds) are way more worried about illegal guns or bombs etc. 

In my years with UPS I personally found illegal drugs once, moved around pharmaceutical drugs almost every day, (unfortunately they watch those packages like hawks) and I have seen and heard about a few larger busts too. And seen a lot of other crazy shit in the mail too. Its pretty crazy what people mail around. Honest question, what happens if the package accidentally gets opened on the way to you? I had totally innocent packages that arrived with the Box sort of torn open, I couldn't imagine what would happen if that would have been an illicit substance...

Can you just claim you didn't know it was going to arrive at your house?  That somebody else sent it to you? Or is that just part of the risk?LOVE this one Wish I was smart enough to figure out how to order them online....but with a prison G.E.D education, I'm pretty sure I'm shit outta luck ever trying to figure it out myself lolDo most people here get stuff from dark net? I've always contemplated it, but just wouldn't be worth the risk to me.
You dumbasses need to stop blowing this shit up. Will you ever get over it? Keep it to yourself. This is the type of shit the DEA displays in powerpoint presentations to their boss when attempting to get funding for dw investigations. You're just fucking yourselves. The less you talk about it, the better off everyone will be.Halleluyerrrr ��Made. My. Day. I get off on sering the mail truck in my neighborhood and think "fuck, he's got an envelope full of fent locked in there and he's going to come to me!? Too kind, sir. Too kindAnd for that, we thank you.It's crushing when he doesn't come though and you know you'll have to wait another 24 long fucking hours���The “sentencing reform act” in 1984 eliminated it for crimes committed after 1987. Part of the get tough on crime bullshit. �������Im over here like MEH.... HAHAHA aintnobodygottimefodat!Trust me they know lol Give us a story mister!  Id love to hear some examples first handYou just deny everything, there's nothing linking you to the package so unless you admit to them what you did they can't do shit.Lol.    They have no clueIf it's packaged appropriately then there should be at least one more visual layer beyond the basic envelope. So, even if it accidentally rips open they shouldn't be able to see anything incriminating.Deny deny denyIt’s part of the risk, go find a vacant house and make sure you have a tracking #There’s some really in-depth guides. All you need is a card, a laptop, and a flash drive. What risk? If you use correctly and safely there is little to no riskIdk copping in the hood is part of the experience for me. It’s an adrenaline rush in and of it itself being somewhere so foreign to me. Like I grew up in a nice upper middle class neighborhood and I had a fucked up fascination with dealing with corner boys, figuring out what spots to go to for what drugs, learning how to navigate the hood without sticking out like an easy target. All in all it humbled me and made me realize people in “the hood” are just people too and everybody’s just trying to make a living.Its not perfectly safe, but as long as you order gram or less, its way safer than the streets. Better quality too.AMENNo, they don't..Alright, biggest one I have ever seen. So I was walking into work one day, and I go through security at the front gate and there is a cop car and a cop van out front. I'm like wtf is happening? 

Well I go to walk to out office for our prework meeting and you have to walk past this caged in area where they take all the contraband/broken or leaking shit to either fix it or hold it. The cops are there with the all the higher up people and security guys fucking around pulling packages out of these paint cans. One of the uniformed cops is there just chillin so I ask what they found, he says they dont know for sure yet but they did a field test on some of it and it was cocaine. So I peek over there and see that they have probably 10 boxes, each with 4 paint cans each and they are pulling just pack after pack out of each one. 

Idk how much it was in total, and it was weird because none of us saw anything about it on the news afterwards. But scuttlebutt says it was some coca, and there was pounds of the shit. 
 
Another time a guy on my shift that was a maintenance guy, (worked on the equipment and such) apparently was pretending to work on the belts near this load from a pharmaceutical distributor and would steal boxes off them to look for pills. Our head of security suspected him, so he literally hid inside a large box near there to catch him in the act. When he did they had the cops search him and his stuff, they found a bunch of oxy and bars, some victorias secret underwear and a dildo all that he admitted to stealing that day. This. Deny everything and in the worst case you gonna need a lawyer but deny everything and say you have no clue who sent that. Lmaoooo fuck yea I've read vacant houses are a bad idea. It's a pretty big red flag when you deliver a package to a location no one lives atThe best way to hide something is to make it as normal as possible.  A person who lives at a house the mailman delivers to regularly is the best.  My mailman stole a package that didn’t have tracking.  He was starting to catch on since I would literally hunt him down for packages; most people don’t care that much lol.  I miss Silk Road 1.0.  The fact of the matter is most people don’t want to make a scene and will just deliver even if they know.I'm looking at the Dark web guide for noobs on here, I'm trying to have it make sense to me. Still extremely new to reddit, only found it after searching for withdrawal cures on google lol. I will persevere, because I live in buttfuck KY and this would seriously come in handy A credit card? Wouldn't there be risk of a vendor just keeping the funds and mailing nothing?You had to “realize” that? Lol.   Well I’m glad u did.Mailmen are drug dogs in disguiseThank you fellow afficionado, i was deeply amused, but probably not as deeply as the maintenance worker's plans for that nightWAIT WHAT HE HID IN THE BOX LOLThe only person who can incarcerate you, is you. Definitely, mailmen know what houses on their route are vacant.Back in the 90s I used the mail all the time, I had a dude that was hooked up w.people south of the border,  he went to ASU. And would send 20#s of killer smoke right through the mail. Lol..I'd just give the people of the house like 100$ or like a QP of smoke..Just bout 4 years ago a guy I knew used the same method,  to a vacant house.He had a guy that lived next door to it,  to watch for the drop , Now, this guy knew the lady that owned it, and she had moved..And I guess she had mentioned renting it out, but didnt say when?
So, since there was no "For rent" sign , they figured the coast was clear..The day the Senders put the package (20#s of killer Dro) in motion. Guys showed up to start doing some renovating to update the house,  lol..Panic was setting in..Obviously this wouldn't look good if the neighbor comes over and grabs a package NOT addressed to him, and yes..it was addressed to the none suspecting neighbor,  an older , not hip, lady that looks nothing like this kinna shit would be going on around her, another reason the decision was made to do this btw..Once the package arrives , the mail LADY actually gets one of the working GUYS to get it since it's so fuckin heavy, lol..The whole thing is going down in front of my dude that's helpless, the package is then actually left outside until the home owner gets there, SO, my buddy gets a call from the watcher and is told he has to get it,  HE CAN'T,  hes held up,  whole other story,  lol..needless to say, the home owner gets it, opens it, and actually calls the cops to turn it in..Neighbors were questioned,  but obviously no one knew,except my dude and his friend..very costly for my dude,  very..You're right,  vacant houses are a no go. Not smart at all to do that. It’s definitely useful if you’re smart and careful with it. Just look at the reviews, rating, and other such factors. Escrow helps a lot as well as it pretty much guarantees arrival for your package. You want a withdrawal cure? Here you go!! It works and I never needed such a high amount as the guy who wrote this.

Edit/Update  -- why downvote me for sharing information that can help people? Smh. This works. I've done it for years and I am happy to talk to anyone about it.  

https://opiated.wordpress.com/2007/03/26/how-to-kick-a-habit-easily-with-zero-discomfort/Yeah you need one to buy crypto currency. BTC and LTC are the most commonly used ones, but I opt for LTC myself because bitcoin is ridiculously easy to track. [deleted]Bigger risks are at customs. Because most drugs on dnm get through international customs in multiple countries before getting to the actual destination, it can get seized by them. Yeah I mean when you’re young and people talk about the hood like it’s this scary place where everyone is a thug and you hear about people getting robbed and killed on the news it’s easy to feel like it’s another world.I seen some weird shit there but that dude takes the cake on the weirdness. I'm sure he threw some dope ass parties tho. 

I found a replica of longclaw (Jon snows sword from GOT) once too. It was sharp and sturdy so I promptly used it to chop a tote box in half before replacing it in the box. I was young and dumb but it felt really cool and amused some of my coworkers greatly. He was gonna have some real fun lmaoYes my dude. There's this area there where the belts all converge that they call the pit and thats where dude was chilling taking the shit off the belts cuz there isnt really anyone there. 

But yea, this security guy put a big ass empty box down there to hide in. Little eyeholes and everything. Dude takes his job super serious obviously. He sprang out and scared the fuck out of dude tooWhat they’ll likely do is put the package back together after cataloging and photographing everything in it and deliver it. Then they’ll watch you and the sender and build a better case and hopefully catch a bigger fish. If you have a habit of using the mail they’ll just intercept every delivery and do the same with them. And when they arrest you they can show a pattern. Good luck trying to deny it then. 

I have a friend who did ten years federal time for doing just this. And there is no parole in the federal system anymore. We had a what i will call STUPID AF mailman that INSISTED my house was vacant. He was new to the area granted but NOPE my house is empty apparently. So figure out your mailmans drug of choice and hook them up for dropping off at the same exact time every day.Am a mailman, can confirm. Holy Christ that is heartbreaking. Not gonna lie, would be tempted to run up on the lady in a balaclava and bounce.I went to asu and it led me to become a heroin addict for those 40$ g thru the Mexicans they didn’t even speak English just “negro, blanca, medio, grande?”

And when they picked up the phone you didn’t know who you were taking to. You just said your cross streets and when you got there just kind of looked around for some Mexican dudes riding together. Nothing out of the ordinary in tempe. They would wave you in the store. You go in they grab a polar pop, throw it in there, you put your money in an empty polar pop and


Switcheroo right when you walk outside you just switch cups. You got your shit no questions asked and they answered all day everyday. Why would he get it in a real persons name that doesn't know anything about it? That's pretty shitty thing to do, it's like the people that live with their parents and get drugs delivered to the house. Thanks for the tips, I appreciate it, although I'm slightly weary of detailed instructions online...wouldn't that be easy for the police to look up as well? And how do I even know it's not written by the Feds to catch idiots like me? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seems like a valid concernThis... Is simply not going to work for a lot of people. Methadone is full agonist opiate just like heroin and works on mu-opioid-receptors primarily, just like heroin--unlike the author said as the reason why the said three methadone dose detox works. You will most likely get right back to being sick as a dog about 24 hours after your third and last methadone dose.Not everyone has access to methadoneCould you explain or possibly tell me where to find a good explanation on how to buy LTC or BTC? I have no idea how any of that works Actually there are so many ways to get bitcoin without credit cards. As of now, I suggest bitcoin because it has the highest value, most recognized, and most stable compare to other crypto/digital currenciesBest to order from a supplier in your own country - no customs. What’s there’s no parole In fed r u sure Lmao, rightI’ve done that plenty of times while I lived with my parents. I just said it was something I bought off eBay for my car and I needed my friends help to install it so they didn’t question me when I put it in my trunk and left Feds very well know what’s going on. They really aren’t after you unless your bringing in ridiculously large amounts constantly. They’re only after the big guys as it’s the most logical way to get big busts. Swatting a dude over let’s say 10 bars is completely ridiculous and that’s why it never really happens. Sigh. I've done this for years. So have my friends. It works. 

I am not a scientist.  I cannot explain how it works.  Actually,  scientists can't explain how a lot of things work -- like benzos, for example.  They don't know HOW they work. They just know THAT they work. 

I don't know HOW this 3 days of methadone thing works.  I just know from years of experience THAT it works.

Detoxes in NYC used to do something similar,  but with a rapd taper. Detoxes and rehabs today do something similar with a rapid taper of subs.

I do the same thing but no taper. You don't get sick 24 hours after your last dose of methadone.  Heck, given methadone's long half-life,  it's still in your system 24  hours after your last dose. That's probably part of the reason this works.

Again, I've done it for years and years as have various friends and roommates.  It works. I have no reason to lie to you. 

You can believe me or not although why you think I or anyone would lie about this I don't know.  If you get the opportunity to try it, definitely do. And when you find out it works, as you will, post about it here.

Edit/Update --  and a downvote. Wtf? Why? Look, I understand this may seem unusual.  It may be new information.  But Ive been polite and I am trying to help people.  So I don't think a downvote is appropriate. I know. But it's still good information to have.  Knowledge is power. If you look up bitcoin atms in your area, there may be one close to you. They charge a little more but all you need is a bitcoin wallet on your phone.  There’s a few sites online you can use to get them. A quick google search will help you pick :)Late reply, but check out paxfulTrue, but most methods require identification, or other such elements You do all your fed timeI just mean, weren't you worried they would bring the mail in and get raided while your weren't there or did you have delivery times set up while you were home? Seems legit, thanks for educating the ignorant lol[deleted]Paxful is a good site to get bitcoin quickly and in ways that are super convenient. Not to hard sell, but that's where I got my first bitcoin with a steam gift card. On the site I use (Paxful), I only need email verificationThank you! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Is this how everyone else got started, Content: , ups: 881, downs: 0For me it was my happiness, stability, and sanity...For me it was my Pokémon cards ��Fidget spinners are a gateway drug.Personally I couldn't find anymore free oxysI definitely started at the bottom of the drug ladder to offset being bored. I can't imagine starting off with HMine was. I got a breathalyzer in my car and couldn’t drink and be able to drive so I started using heroin instead. True story. 28 months clean now thank god It was my ex wife. It was either h or murder. I chose the lesser of two evils. I can't wait to tell my mom that she could have avoided years of disappointment and pain if she had just bought me that damn fidget spinner! relapsed cus of this���For me it was dropping out of college. Usually it's the reverseMine started with a conversation:

Friend: \*nodding off\* "I should introduce you to Harry bro!"  
Me:  "I dunno man, i'm pretty content with Mary atm"

Friend: "Fuck Mary"

&#x200B;

And that's how it started. I need to find a Delorean and go back to that point in my life.Fuck man this is bringing up feelsThis speaks to me This made me lol too hardI started accidently through no fault of my own. There I was walking down the street to go help out at the orphanage and I tripped and fell onto a perfectly positioned loaded rig that stuck perfectly into my vein and my weight falling on it made it inject into my bloodstream. Lol 


Nah really I lost a bet and the loser had to get hooked on heroin. Who was the bet with? Life.


(These are jokes for those of you that cant tell)

I love playing with that shit while I nod Lol is there anyone else when they come across the name Devon automatically think "DEVON GET THE TABLE!" ???Why not? LMAOOOOOO no but thats how i relapse ���For me it was weed, xans, booze, shrooms, in hs then adderall and xans and blues and 80’s, then snorting h, been shooting h 4 years, but now on methadone clinic at 170 mg’s with a script of Wellbutrin and xans- 3 footballs a day, I be feeling right everydayIt was either dope and slowly kill myself or immediate hanging.Nicely said. i apparently have a lot of friends addicted to fidget spinners...they always talk about get spun out all the time...it sounds like its a brutal addiction, it ruins your teeth and they cause vicious paranoia .....I dont think Im ever gonna try a fidget spinnner...how can something so small be ruining out country..this getting spun stuff is crazy.

apparently all those dudes out at 3am are all hooked on fidget spinning..Lol!
Yeah... the ones I was buying were suddenly gone, and the new ones would turn into a gel like substance. Quite inconvenient. 
So, Heroin here I come! What’s that, kind sir? $15? I’ll take two! same except first thing I tried was a few vicodin that were left by my great grandmother when she was living with us. popped 3 and fell in love with the sedation/opiate itch. other than that it was the standard stoner/hippie progression through high school... schwag-mids-shrooms-chronic-lsd and/or mdma.

strangely enough it would be another 4 years before I would try another opiate when splitting an old school 60mg oc with a homie. that's what ended up getting me hooked.i think it’s a common misperception that (most) people start out doing heroin. as if someone just out of the blue offered them heroin and they were like, “yea, that sounds wonderful!” i think that’s why addiction is so stigmatized, because people think it’s that simple, so they‘re like, “well just don’t shoot heroin in the first place.” wow, thanks, franklin, i really didn’t consider that. [deleted]Happy b day my dude metro ❤️�bitches be tripping yo....

lolDamn bro Nods in agreement So you dropped out for heroin or because of heroin?Exit the community. You're kidding right?How the hell do people get continually upped to 170?? I was shooting 3g of dope a day but after 3 weeks of 50 mgs methadone im clearly super stable on it and as much as id like to go way up i dont have any real withdrawal symptoms remaining and i feel like itd be hard to fake still being so uncomfortable for so many more weeks until im at a dose like that lol. I second that. Dope doesn't kill you, people do.psst. pssst. yo playa, yeah you. you tryin to get spun? *opens trench coat revealing dozens of fidget spinners*It’s getting “spun outta control” huh? 

Teehee. I was reading your comment all the while thinking "nice, bro" then realized I was giddy about someone's addiction story. Tf is wrong with me. 

Mine started with Vicodin too. 10years Vic's, 4 years Suboxone, 2 years herion.hey them old vicodins were the shitSame exact thing! Grandma would give me her liquid morphine and vics and percs.Then came the ocs (a month of heroin) and finally the animal that is methadone.Yeah I was very persistent on never doing dope, didn’t even get into pills. I could of counted all the percs or painkillers in general on two hands before I got into heroin. Just doing cocaine, and that progressed to crack when I walked in the bathroom and my buddy was blasting off, and he was a junkie so it was like never be like this guy. Just stayed with the hard for a year and eventually had a bunch of heroin I was sitting on and was coming down and was wondering how well it would ease the landing and really the rest is history, fucking loved it. 

Just Kratom psychs and bud now. Lol franklin was one of my rehab councilors so that put that whole comment with a picture of him at the other end and gave me a good laugh Well some people do... i mean im sure very very few as their first drug but probably lots as their first opiate. It was my first downer for sure[deleted]Lol.. Thx for the laugh. I couldn't figure out how to do it. hahahaEnter the dragonCome onThat's ridiculousI ain't trying to get spun, motherfucker! I use them *medicinally*! Now, uh...lemme hold one till Thursday...
I’m laughing so hard right now. 
(Reaching out the window and throws an empty pack of cigarettes down to the person on the street with three spinners inside)I only smoke crack, I'll never be like you, smelly junkie.i feel you. i always thought it was funny how crackheads are portrayed, all playing rug doctor and shit. i thought it was a joke. well, what do you know, first time i smoked crack and i'm looking through my sweater to see if i can gather up enough rocks for another stuffie. rocks will fuck you up, quick. blow through your money, quick. put me on a mission to stroll through the mission to sample every cornerboy's girl, looking for only the "finest" of rocks. really, i just wanted a reason to smoke as much fucking crack as i could. i associated with some very strange folks because of crack.haha, yea, that's where the reference came from, i had a counsellor named franklin at my treatment center too. any chance you went to treatment in northern california? probably extremely unlikely but it would be pretty neat if we're talking about the same guy. yea, for sure, you're right. i didn't mean to suggest that it never happens. i moved to slamming heroin from my first opiate, oxy, pretty quickly. but i think for a lot of people, they start out using to counter something like pain or depression, as opposed to just jumping right in the deep end shooting dope. but yea, like you said, there are people that do.okay, but i’m more so talking about stigma and opinions, separate from knowledge of addiction. within the field of addiction, there is generally a lot of understanding and education, like you said. but, at least in my experience, people’s opinions of addicts can be pretty narrow-minded. some folks seem to see addiction as black and white. i totally agree that general societal understanding of addiction is progressing, but i think destigmatization still has a long way to go.

i live in california. people here are for the most part very open-minded. but even here on reddit, there are a lot of very strong opinions regarding addicts — i guess with the anonymity of the internet, people feel free to express these opinions.Good for you for leaving her. I can’t imagine doing heroin to cope with an unhealthy relationship. I hope you’re in a healthier place man, in both respects.I get it.GTFORofl, happy new years brother/sister!...dips on the plugHey that’s alright. 

Crack brought my life to worst points than heroin did. I did bad and shady things for both at times, together or separate but boy did crack literally bring out my crack head shit. 

And the only thing this junkie smells like is Gucci son. It’s very easy to do. I’ve definitely been there as well. If I knew I was going to be jonesing, yet had enough to make this worth doing, I’d bust a gram up into a good bit of rocks and throw them into a preswept section of carpet, so that way when I needed something to do I could carpet surf for more. Sometimes it worked great and kept me busy all night, one time I loaded up a big old rock of cookie cream and fucked up my lungs and pipe. That shit sucked. 

I’d known people that would surf at their dudes house, people would get kicks out of it. Laughing, throwing more crumbs on the floor. It’s crazy how much pride it’ll take from you for another hit. Some of the ways people would degrade themselves for a 2 minute blast is astonishing. Yeah, I see where you’re coming from. burning bridges over less than $20 since 2009Lol, sorry that was supposed to be you saying that to your friend shooting up in the bathroom from your story.

Thought it was funny how you didn't want to be a junky so only smoked crackOh and what does Gucci smell like? Vinegar? Im curiou qhat types of thing you didPricelessYeah it’s crazy how the worked out. I told myself I’d never do cocaine either, but than when it was around, and I had the money to play, it pretty much changed to I’ll never do heroin. I loved it, and that time smoking crack was fucking amazing. He gave me a blast and a half, that short lived ten minute amazing turned around to just another twenty two more times that night. I learned to go big or not play at all lol. 

He was the perfect reason to never do heroin. To not be a Gary. The place I was staying at was a duplex, 5 of us one one side, and 4 on the other, all friends or mutual friends from high school. Always partying, liquor and cocaine and k2 since I sold it and smoked it and that’s where the cash came from to keep partying. Gary needed a place to crash and it was like why not, a few people pretty much always crash here yet don’t live here, what’s one more. He said he was done with the junk. He’d already lost everything from it and was just building back up. 

And we were always trying to stay with the best coke, always buying bags, going through me or a few others, either hoping for something better or better price, it’s just good to know what’s around and establish connections. And one night Gary had the best of the deals for the girl so we gave the money to him, like three of us, and only two of us got our girl, my buddy came up 60 short because he had to swallow the bag when he got pulled over but kept the others? And Gary later that night after our suspicions were high, came out of the bathroom nodding with pinned eyes, said he got lucky and found 4 15s at his dudes. 

4x15=60. Also only swallowed one bag of blow, kept two, and found 4 15s. We collectively through him out so fast, 2 am pouring rain throwing his shit outside telling him to kick rocks. 

But boy did that fucker change my life. Cracks fucking amazing. Crack and heroin are as good as it gets. 

And boy it smells fucking amazing. Gotta get a bottle when you can. I got one for Christmas last year and have smelt good as fuck for over a year lol. What do you mean? I have stories or warning for days lol. I tried crack once at the trap and I'm assuming I just didn't smoke it right or was timid cause it was pretty lack luster. Probably for the best that it didn't rock my world. 

Fucking Gary. It's crazy how people think that kinda shit will work out for them, that or they just don't give a fuck...I'm fucking loving your words man, care to hit me with another story?Yea he just really didn’t. He hadn’t been doing them often, like not really at all. He’d been doing coke with us pretty often, he’d throw down when he could but we weren’t stingy, you’d walk in the door and there’d be a pile of black plates and powder going around and if the party ever got to big we just went up stairs to the bedroom. Like he fucked up what would be a great thing to be in his position all over a high. But shit will do that. 

And yeah that’s probably good. It helped he showed me how to hit it, and he was already geeked when I walked in so he wasn’t wanting to see any wasted. And it blasted me off, to the point I was pretty disappointed when I couldn’t talk him into walking the neighborhood. I’m trying to think of a good oneHaha, I might have to give it another shot.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Literally the worst, Content: , ups: 851, downs: 0"have you tried not sleeping?Lmaoo this is literally the experience I had with my last psych and therapist, trying to convince me snorting Xanax will get me higher, or even worse, Zoloft feels similar to opiates.How about you don't do drugs till our next session and telll me how it goes?I had a therapist trying to recommend an alprolozam script for me, knowing full well I was an active junkie. It was kinda nuts. I almost took him up on it. Yes im sorry i dont care how many books youve read idc how many docuseries youve watched i dont care how many family members youve seen addicted you can not counsel some body about being physically mentally and emotionally addicted to fentanyl if you have not woken up soaked in your own pool of sweat with 6 months of unpaid bills on your counter 12 dollars in your bank acct that the only way you have access to is if you close the acct so you count the 2 dollars in change you have take yourself to your credit union close the acct while sweat drips down your face and the woman helping you asks you why your closing your acct with them to which you reply ive got to eat maam she then slides you a paper to sign and your shaking so bad you can barely scribble you collect your 12.30 cents now your at 14.30 and you troop 30 blocks in the rain thats now falling for 3 bags that amount to maybe .1 of a gram but fuck if this all wasnt worth it then you stand in said rain soaked for 25 minutes before the guy tells you shit my guys eating walk two more blocks over to me ill serve you you then reply with bro im soaked its 24 degrees and ive been standing in the rain for half hour just waiting can you throw 1 on top for all the nonsense there reply bro you havent called me forever to which you reply I AINT BEEN GTTN HIGH YOU KNOW YOUR MY ONLY GUY  while this is true they cave and say ok ok you get your 4 bags amounting to .1 and a few grissles and all is well you inquire if they stock suboxone because thats what you really want as youve been taking them the last month cause your sick of the bullshit but you cant find any today and you just need something but to no avail they say nahh with a look of are you crazy i want you addicted fool so you take your sad 4 bags and walk your 30 blocks back home cause hey everythings okay now even though you know its not that was 4 days ago in the days since you buy 5 bags each day trying to stay well hoping each day your sub plug will say hes got subs again but no luck and you know when he does get them they wont be working the way they were prior to your 4 day slip up because now your bodys use to the junk again so you pray at night wondering how the fuck your gonna scrounge up ten dollars in the hopes you can get a sub tomorrow knowing the sub wont do much but hoping it does something and if no subs are available jesus how will you get 25 dollars for the .133 that your 5 bags contain all the while a stunning drug free college educated beautiful 29 year old woman lays in bed waiting for you to cuddle up next to her because she cant sleep well with out you she knows your addicted but she loves you anyway and she would give you the money to keep you well but youve already taken all she has to give shes working 3 jobs to keep you housed and fed and you cant ask for anything more from her she would help if she could but shes already helped so much that all her funds are exhausted and shes scraping by carrying you the entire way also she sees your pain but shes helpless at the moment you sit outside smoking cigarettes in despair not quite sick 4 bags ingested with 1 left will you be able to save it till the morning so you can maybe get a jump start on a day labor gig for the day probably not so you sit and type smoking reds thinking about just ending it all but you cant you have people that love you just a handful but they are there what to do whst to do i dont know where this was suppose to go but long story short how do you counsel this lord help me Have you tried not craving them? I always dose at 9am. Unless I sleep past 9am. All these comments have me cracking the fuck up. Counselors that haven’t been through it. But oh wait they had a family member go through it so they know exactly how our minds work! Yea right gtfo noob��� Ok, now this right here is just ridiculously accurate. Especially the kind of counselors you see at a MAT/MMT clinic. This can even apply to the people actually working on the medical side of things. I can't tell you how many times I've overheard the dosing nurses and even the friggin nurse practitioner say something so utterly ridiculous that I'm left a bit speechless. This is hilarious and so true. I have a hard time even taking what they say seriously if they aren't a (long time) recovering addict themselves. Lmao. I have a new counselor at the clinic and to be fair I am holding big things close to the best but after our first two sessions I’m like hmmmmm .. she might be... umm clueless I don't think they need to be full blown recovering addicts to understand how to help, but if they have never tried drugs at all, I have a hard time seeing them being able to understand.I’ve had this experience before but my current therapist was heavily addicted to alcohol and opiates so she is very understanding and helpful in my recovery.Best response worst life incase your wondering i didnt save the last bag and i crawled into bed and cried my eyes out to my saint of a lady whos response was i love you itll be okay well get you back on subs i loveee this woman and if you saw her you would say wtfffff is she doing but thank god for her seriously thnk god for her I had a psychiatrist at the psych ward ask me "Do you like boys or girls?" "Both to an extent."

Psych: Are you a cat person or a dog person?

Me: I was raised with both and love both.

P: Oh, I see. Well, where I was going with that was that you have to start saying no to drugs. Just how most people don't have to think about refusing their non preferred, you just have to automatically refuse when presented with drugs.

M: Oh wow, doc, I can't believe I never thought of just wishing my problem away! It's all so clear!

Doc had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. Like for real, are you Nancy Reagan? I’m a strong believer they should not be counselors or addiction experts until they themselves have intentionally gotten themselves addicted to a drug and had to experience withdrawals and everything that comes along with life everyday while dealing with that. 

This is definitely one of the best memes I’ve ever seenWelcome to Canada...Hey, maybe you can help me out as I am a little confused. I notice this pic seems to be a local jpg but I was told you had to link from imgur to post pics. Can you clarify?When you lack the ability to use an open mind. When your unwilling to take suggestions or theres a selfish drive to always be right. 
Clearly poor choice of words, no wonder they get  poor responses to  questions or statements.“I used to get headaches when I wouldn’t have my Starbucks so yes, I know exactly what it’s like going through fentanyl withdrawals”People who say anything about snorting Xanax makes me want to shoot them up with...well I was gonna say ibogaine but I'm leaning more towards and actual gun. Thats hyperbolic but the rage I feel when people say dumb shit like that is all consuming. Artie lange had a good bit about this when he was on Conan a few years ago.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5z6bZAT2EM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5z6bZAT2EM)Why were they trying to suggest that? I don't use opioids, but why not suggest one of those drugs that exists to help ween you off?12 hours later....its not going great, think ill go do drugs. You’re a stronger person than me yeah  would have shaggy'd that quick. (yoink)I had a rehab write me a script for ambien that my pcp continued until I woke up in jail. Twice This.....just best response right here.The experience of needing dope and risking getting ripped off and played with and all that.... yeah it's incredibly stressful. 

Make suboxone cheap and OTC I say, if not full legalization that would still do a world of good. People don't rob and steal cause they want to get high, they do it cause they don't want to be sick. Oh fuck. I wish i had thought about that! Im cured  doc!do you ever think that... yeah - counselors that havent been through it.... look at us like we are fucking retarded and equally naive when they listen to us talk about the shit we do for a drug addiction? as an addict, this post makes me sick with how fucking dumb a lot of us sound... because this person trying to help you hasnt made a bunch of really stupid mistakes, and has a steady job, and doesnt stab themselves with needles, they are the real idiots and have nothing to say that could possibly help me. non-junky idiots i tell ya. how foolish they are. lol. bring on the down votes, you guys can keep victimizing yourselves. That's like saying an Oncologist can't effectively treat cancer if they haven't beaten leukemia. It's one thing to be ignorant like the counselor in the picture but I've dealt with lots of of counselors who weren't former addicts who were still extremely knowledgeable and empathetic to my problems.What does this even mean?You don't need imgur anymore. When you create a post it gives you the option to upload a picture from your device, on most subsI'm not reading anything about that in the sidebar. Who told you that? good one, clever boy.I had one tell me he knew what it was like because he bought too many scratch off lottery tickets... I’m like yeah dude that’s identical to shooting up with puddle water and then hiding the abscess you get until it burst in your long sleeve shirt that you have on even though it’s 105 degrees Ugh I gave my friend a whole bar the other day bc she was dopesick and when I got back from class, she had SNORTED the whole thing. And not only had she snorted it, she snorted it with adderall. WTF? I wanted to shake the stupid out of her, I was so pissed she wasted the bar.I did it once, what's wrong with it?I honestly like snorting Xanax lol... the taste and drip and fixation of putting things up my nose is real... even though poping them is the right way to get ur money’s worth For depression/anxiety, I wasn't dependent and was a minor so that's probably whyFor me it was more like as soon as I walked out the door and get into buddy's car lollol same, when I was 15 years old. To be fair, it had just hit the market and they didn't know all the horrible side effects of it yetya know you just have to fake it till you make it. I know your'e 40 hours no sleep deep into wd's, but lets try a smile.Maybe they should try another counseling profession instead of addiction then???????????? I understand where you are coming from, but addiction is a whole different ballgame. IMO They just can’t effectively understand why you are feeling how you are feeling and why you are doing the things you do regardless of how negatively they impact your life unless they have been there. But like I said, just my take. thank you for this comment. the comments on this page are comically self-centered. sheer bigotry.Just a jab at how much of a joke service providers seem to be 

You go in looking to get off pills and they’re just going by the book Does that include regular pc?A mod said you have to link to imgur"Have you tried just saying no? I find that when I want a regular coca-cola, I just say, '"you know, I don't need that." And I go for a brisk walk "Then just fucking snort heroin wtf You’re what is commonly referred to as a “weirdo”Ah, I see, thanks.No because then this page wouldnt exist.For real though what's toxic is this feeling of superiority people get from having "never been addicted." No oncologist feels superior to his patients because he "wasn't dumb enough to get cancer" but I'm sure there are more than a few addiction specialists who feel this way about addiction. Some people can, it's very rare thoYes sir, when you post, it will give you options they'll be "link", "text", "photo" ect.... if you pick photo, i'tll let you upload images directly. I think they meant “if you’re going to link to a photo hosted outside of Reddit, it needs to be hosted on imgur”. 

They don’t want people linking to random tumblr blogs or google itself. Either hit upload on Reddit (which uploads and links to imgur) or link to a photo already hosted on imgur. 

Hope this helps. I'd talk to that mod for clarification then, if I were you. This.  Omg this.  

I had a therapist leading one of my groups use the example of ‘wanting another cookie and saying no’ to tell us that she understands what we’re going through.  The class was full of heroin and crack addicts.  Seriously lady?  I’ll ‘just say no’ to anything you have to say after that. Lmao my Dad could cure everyone with a brisk walk. Exercise... yepHaha the ol brisk walk. Don’t forget mindfulness, yoga & Pilates! This is so accurate that I got angry when I read it. Ugh I do that too bitchYou seem to have a real problem with how people take their drugs. Why does it bother you so much?Thanks for helping!! :) :)Thanks. Reddit help is not all that comprehensive, it seems to me. I tried to upload a local jpeg for the first time, but somehow it did not load right. Then I posted, but no picture. So then they are telling me about imgur, so I guess that is the way to go. My group therapist tried to compare hit over eating with drug addiction. I spoke up and said one of the requirements to be a drug counselor should be a history w drug addiction. Over eating!! Are u serious!!!!?I had a counsler try to relate his depression of losing his mother (he was early 40's) with the depression i was going through due to massive OC wd's and losing a few friends to a bust.Will f*** just eats one cookie?You ever tried snuff?It's that, it's the fact benzos don't get you high from snorting it, you just get high from it dripping down your throat and swallowing it from snorting it. Take your drugs any which way you want, as long as you get high from doing it. It's like saying "why do you get mad from people smoking their mdma?" Idk i might get downvoted into oblivion, but that's my train of thought. I'm not going to bitch someone out for taking their drugs a certain way but it's going to make me really frustrated when someone thinks doing something gets you way higher when in reality it dosnt get them high at all really.Why are you acting like people actually care what gets said in an internet thread? You're quite welcome, it isn't often I can be useful when it comes to technology lolYeah this one is OK man losing your mother can be devastating depending on the person losing a mother is a lot more depressing than your self-induced drug problem. do you know how moronic you sound? i guess MASSIVE oc wd's are worse than someone losing a life. lol. everyone in here bitching about therapists... shouldnt have gotten yourself in the situation where you have to see one. we must take responsibility for our habit.Ever boof snuff?
But smoking mdma is the most efficient way of consuming it!i lost both my parents in my 20's, im fine. i was fine. people die.dont know why your downvoted. thats truthThat sounds painful True enough, my favorite way is to sprinkle it onto an open wound..I'm sorry man but the way you feel is not universalYou are suppose to take it out of the can Bro I take my vitamin c tablets the exact same way!I'm not a psychopath, i was sad, i cried.  But it wasnt mind bending depression like kicking an IV habit. Ayy lmao @@@@@@@@@@ Title: One of my friends sent this to me on FB earlier LOL, Content: , ups: 849, downs: 0Added this to this list of jokes I can't tell my friends cause they won't get it I think it would hBs been funnier if f was like “let’s see what’s underneath the roxy”

AmiRight ? take off the fentanyl mask to reveal: **carfentanyl!**  

Under that one is...*the Reaper.*I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling testing labs!this is mean but r/lilpeepKinda funny not really tho fent bars are rare af and usually just a cross contamination from pressing multiple things it would have been better if it was a blue or sum heroin Lmao that’s some funny shytBorrowing this kk LMAOyeah everyone’s gotta learn their lesson, first time I every tried benzos I was 18 or 19 did a bunch of Kpins cause they were 2 bucks a pop and I was used to paying 10 a pop for e pills so I was like give me 40 bucks worth. 

        Ate em all over the night with a friend because we didn’t think felt it. started drinking later and a older kid we knew saw us popping pills and asked what they were, once he found out he said Stop drinking immediately but we didn’t listen. 

        later on another friend asked me to drive his car cause he was drunk, I said sure went to pull out into the street and had turned the steeering wheel all the way to the wrong side and immediate hit a telephone poll. Not too much damage but my driving privileges were taken away from me. the dude ended up driving with me in his car and his license was suspended and ofc we get pulled over, tried to run, almost faked em out by pulling in a driveway with a fence before they made the turn. 
 
        Didn’t work tho. Ended up impounding the car but not arresting him because  hey saw how fucked up I was and said we made the right decision by having him drive! Crazy. After that o quit drinking with benZos for a long time It's a damn shame I haven't found any that don't need to be shipped in the mail. I'd switch my name to Bartard Maximus and die happy if I didn't forget I took em.

The people who don't want em, get em. I'm over here like, "I accept any and all forms of hard narcotics" and all I hear is "Ayy I got half a sub". Gtfoh.I’m dead XDYour friends never watched Scooby Doo? I think you know what you need to do. Hahaha! Yeah it would have. Xanax is just such a fad right now though, it's kind of annoyingKnew a guy who almost died from fent bars recently. He was damn lucky our friend who is on subs was there to shove a couple under his tounge.Shut up and take my money.Agreed, idk why people keep pushing this false narrative. Thanks for saying this. I really don't believe there have ever been bars intentionally pressed with fent. Cross\-contamination, sure. But the economics just don't make sense, let alone effects are so different.Time to get pressed bars Its in a weird place where it has nowhere near the stigma of opiates, but IMO its just as addictive, especially if ur an anxious person. I would put Xanax on the same shelf as Oxycodone. Its a hard drug! But nobody treats it like that, fricken saul from Breaking Bad had a wole drawer of them! Being a bartard is just as shitty as being a junkie in some ways, if not worse in others, and harder to get out, because that shit can kill youAll these kids taking Xanax fail to realize that Pfizer has been marketing it since 1981.ive been prescribed for half of my life on and off. This drug is almost 30. Years. Old. 
I also hate how presses are treated like they're actually worth half a shit. There's young people out here who are addicted to xanax bars....and have never put a single milligram of alprazolam into their bodies.......
How much sense does that make? 
Its so senseless.I'm not quite sure that's how that works. The naloxone in subs is to prevent their abuse. Wouldn't do much for a real fent OD, and the added bupe would exacerbate any respiratory depression from the benzo/fent combo.[deleted]Awww look three sheeple were actually smart enough to kno I was calling them sheeple and down voted me what ever will I do without 3 reddit karma I’ve been ruined damn u sheeple damn u all to hell lmao �I do it’s called sheeple lmao � can’t research or cross reference anything on there own and look at it logically and Discern for themselvesYea no problem your welcome and your right the economics is exactly the proof that it’s not intentional and the bigger picture to the efftects is that dealin drugs is a business and ppl in buisness do not want to give u the wrong product and the customers b unsatisfied let alone end up dead so the can never give there money to you again for drugs in the future which once again is economics exactly why they don’t intentionally press fent bars and like I said anyone that believes that they do is truly among the sheeple masses  I was gonna say heroin, but that works too.I never liked the shit. I have a short enough attention span as it is. Life is already short enough as it is. I don't need to forget anymore of it than I already do. 

Plus, I've lost a lot of really close friend to this shit because they got strung out on it and it completely changed. They would get violent and try to hit me for no reason. I had a friend walk up to me one night after he'd been on a binge with it for like 4 days straight and he tried to hit me in the head with a glass cup in his fist. I was just sitting at my computer desk. Nothing had been said, nothing had happened at all. Just got up all of a sudden and walked up to me to try and hit me. 

Then the friends who went around driving and flipped their cars, totaled their shit. 

Imo, it destroys peoples personalities more than Heroin does.  Xanax just E R A S E S everything it means to be YOU. Being a bartard sucks ass but I’ve never found benzos to be remotely as addictive as opiates because of the lack of euphoria. There is no fiendish pull to do them like I used to experience with opiates, I can use a benzo therapeutically once or twice a week, where as opiates became everyday very very quickly. There just isn’t much of a high or euphoria with a benzo like Xanax, not like opiates at least. The addiction to bars is worse. The withdrawals last weeks, and unlike dope withdrawals they you won't just feel like you're dying. Benzo withdrawals can actually kill you. And a lot of the home pressed bars are fentanyl. Last year I was popping bars to get through withdrawals like I always do and I realized *there was no withdrawals.* After 2 weeks when I ran out of bars I got hit with nasty fuckin withdrawals out of the blue cuz the home press bars i had werent benzos but opiates, and one would have to assume fentanyl. [deleted]Bupe can counteract opioid overdoses in a similar way to nalaxone. Or at least I have been led to believe that.Bupe has one of the highest binding affinities around, it's why you can't get high while it's still in your body without taking a supremely stupid dose of another strong opiate.Totally opiate naive, super high benzo tolerance. Fent has low oral bioavailability.Lmao.  I upvoted you.Much more than boofing Kratom.You've completely spoke in rhyme , do you do that all the time ?IMO benzos are wayyyyyyyyyy worse than opiates.  it's not even close.

it's like hard liquor in pill form with extra memory loss/blackout potential.

and it's better at "relieving anxiety" ie removing ALL your inhibitions, especially your GOOD inhibitions.

it removes all your higher brain function and you just run on animal instinctI didn't think of the bupe 'taking over' the receptors. But that makes sense with precipitated withdrawal. Still seems like 'a few strips' added to whatever was happening wasn't the best idea. In my experience sublingual bupe takes 45-60mins to really start acting. Isn't that enough time for the fent to get you first?




And you still have to deal with the combined respiratory depression.[deleted][deleted]Thank you I don’t know what I woulda done with all those down votes might have loaded a phat rig with pure fent bars and ended it all � and btw u didn’t have to u weren’t one of those Grimy two timing sheeple that like other sheeple to violate them atop a float in the middle of an LGBT parade lol srry if that went too far n offended u or anyone that swing the other way I just find that a lot of sheeple don’t know how to “identify” and like to b social justice warriors  Omg I fucking love benzos...Yeah, I got access to a stash of Valiums when I was a teenager (long, long ago, before internet) and even then I'd rather have had alcohol.  Different chemistry I guess.  I had a buddy basically get addicted to DXM (changed his personality, too, over months), I tried it once on his suggestion...never again.  Other than alcohol, Mother Morphine and her descendants seem to be the only things I'm attracted to.I am an alcoholic who will often smash benzos to cure the anxiety of being so drunk, after a 5th and 50mg of Valium since you're an anxious person you spend the next 3 hours monitoring you're heart rate promising you won't do it again.

I am...Hey, it worked. He is is alive and taking his final exams, ready to graduate UMD. I'll take it.[deleted][deleted]if you treat it with respect like you would heroin you can have a normal habit with... unfortunately most people have to learn their lesson by going overboard first.... as did I lolI'm just saying wondering if it worked, or if he wasn't as far gone as you all thought. I mean, I'm not going to shit on any situation where people are doing the best they can with what they have, but I'm still skeptical that seeing someone who has ingested some amount of (supposed) benzo, then deciding it was probably fent and treating it with a few(!) sub strips (that is a shit-ton of bupe of he was opiate naive) is a best harm reduction practice.




Glad he is ok, though.Well if it was IV'd, my understanding is that then the naloxone would work.I really doubt that bars are being pressed en masse with fent, it's just not economically viable or sensible. I imagine this is much more likely a case of cross contamination from poor handling.I used to hate em back when I did opiates, but now theyre actually super useful for helping with anxiety and shit.

never went full bartard... just like 3/4 bartard and that was good enough for me.I have know other people who have used this method. Unfortunately if my friend had called the paramedics it would likely have resulted in them being expelled from uni. And he knew it was fent because friend who was on subs took some and recognized the feeling, and the symptoms. And belive me I know how dangerous benzos and subs can be, lost my best friend to that combo.[deleted]Honestly it COULD be happening, but I see very little if any evidence; I've yet to see any confirmed reports of this, though admit that I do not follow much US news. Any decent sized DNM vendor would not bother doing this, it's not profitable and all vendors know how much fentanyl sellers are being targeted. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Accurate, Content: , ups: 822, downs: 0Every time I yawn lately my parents are like you've gotta stop those pills. 
And I'm like yeah my day was good, long but good, you? I used to hate putting on a fucking act. If i say I'm fine I'm fine.Yup.. soon as my eyes close ... “YOUR NODDING!” Finger pointers up.. I just lost me two best and only friends because they decided Im using again and that's the last straw, because I was tired one night hanging out. I've been clean a year. To be completely fair we WERE also on drugs. Agree. A few weeks ago, i went from Charlotte to Mexico City, down to Acapulco, jumped over to deal with an issue at Panama Canal, then to Bogata Columbia, then to Rio de Janiero, Brazil and back to Mexico for a day then home to Miami �� 

All in 12 days. I passed out at dinner and the wife is like, are u on fuking dope ....��Dude this is so accurate. I can’t believe as soon as I got home this meme popped up.....Guys I'm already high....dunno how I'll manage the turkey and scrubbing the potatoes...maybe some Moda or Ms. Rita-lin to wake me up? Enjoying the days off! 

Happy Thanksgiving you all. 

&#x200B;Been getting dirty looks all day. I’m sure I’ll hear about it once everyone leaves.Lmao always!!Whats dank recovery?  I would yelled at about being high while on vivitrolLMFAOOmg I was opposite. I was the only one who passed out after and they thought something was wrong. Like, yes I'm still high but I swear it was the Turkey!!YusssMy family always thinks I'm high when I'm actually sober I'm like wtf!I used to have ptosis (droopy eyelids) and I always had that permanent high/stoned look. Finally got surgery to correct it and I didn’t realize how much I was missing out on seeing by not having regular open eyes that's interesting cause the only time I ever yawn is when i'm in withdrawal or otherwise not high. my family is pretty cool with my opioid habit though so they're not gonna say anything even if they thought I was yawning cause I was high.I'm so sorry that happened. Congratulations on the year ... I've got 15 months.Don't let it throw you off, it's them not you,and this phase of theirs will pass when they see that you don't descend back down the rabbitholeAnd continue to be... This is what happens when u watch narcos once smh And sober when im actually high. Aint that some shit?Retarded blame culture forces us to lie about our habit, when in reality we'd rather be honest �Back in the day I was snorting so much heroin and ice one day and my mom looked at me and said this is how I like you when you’re sober and interactive with everyone.  Then when I was sick she would be mad at me that I was on drugs.  Kinda fucks with your head.My family too, close friends, spouse.

&#x200B;

The on top of the world workaholic they think is sober(hahahahaha) and the sullen withdrawn lazy sleeping all day they think is on drugs(lol).Haha yeah it was always opposite because they got so used to seeing me high.Right?! They’re like “we know you’re high because that’s when you get angry at us.” I’m like damn y’all when I’m high is when I’m most relaxed and not tryna fight. When I’m sober and y’all are tripping on me is when I get pissed lolI have a question, were you able to open your eyes completely when you tried? Because I know someone who almost constantly has partially shut eyes but if someone bugs him about it he can force them all the way open. In any case, I’m glad you got them fixed and can see better now! Not all junkies fly signs or give up ass for $$. This will be my 18th year covering the SA/CA zone.
My product is pure and uncut ..Nice username lol. 
Also i feel like it’s because they’re used to you being high so when you aren’t you seem different Good point. I’d love to be honest with people. Everyone would benefit from the honesty and quite frankly it would lead to lower mortality rates and overall less drug use. [deleted]lol, yup. my ma always thought i was high when i was withdrawing. she thought being high made me into a sickly, irritated, pissy shit. then when i was high, she thought i was sober because i was “back to normal.” 

now that i’m sober i get so self-conscious about how i act because i don’t want people to think that i’m high. it’s weird.Yeah I could open them all the way but I actively had to do it, it felt unnatural and didn’t look right. Otherwise I looked like I was either really tired or stoned. wait what do you actually do? If youre not comfortable saying that's cool but is this a legit, above-board type of job? Ya and when you're not high you feel like shit and look fucked up... Parents just don't understand ������ like no when I'm completely functional and playing Yehtzee with y'all I'm high... I guess because other drugs do fuck you up and impair you, make you look funny and that's all they have to compare it to?Lol thanks. And thats a fair point.Dude that’s such a good point it’s like they get used to you when your wasted but when you stone cold sober they always like what’s wrong with you , are you using again ? Like fuuuuck I’m sober Ma take it easy Bitch THIS yes. This thread has me TRIGGERED ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������


The turkey snuck in when I was furiously tapping. Happy thanksgiving y’all So you talk about opiates freely with your family and they don't blame them for X or for Y? CuntVery legit.

How'd you figure out that's what you wanted to do? I'm completely fucking lost at this point in my life. Manual labor, no matter ""well"" it pays, is going to destroy me. It already has.

Damn, I wish I'd had any sort of discipline and realism about the world when I was in school. Making me wanna go back.RetardCan't even  make a constructive argument lol... @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Every single time, Content: , ups: 811, downs: 0When I’ve mixed all the cns depressants and I forget to breath.Did that really truly happen to you guys? You really went from auto to manual? That's scary scary. If you take a ton of promethazine it's shit too I never got how people could take codiene promethazine syrup but then again maybe the tablets are worse. Good for the itching and shit, though. I used to breathe in deeply and audibly when my ex wasn't breathing as often as I'd like. And then she would inhale after she heard me. It was like I was reminding her, hey this is what breathing sounds like you should try it. 

I tried to just let her enjoy it without constantly asking her if she's okay, but also wanted to make sure she was safe, obviously. i swear i be taking the deepest breaths tryna make sure i stay alive �This happens to me more when I'm sober than when I'm highHell yeah Or I'd die lol (joking but as a hater of hashish but weirdly every other hallucinogenic I love) that's what I feel panicking from a a high I Hate unless it's at the end of a trip or similar only Times hashish or cannabis doesn't makes me feel like crap. 
I use my cpap machine in case I forget Breathing for us is not a choice nor an act we control unless supertrained for a long time (as in deep divers) but still you WILL breath or take a breath even under water in most cases even trained before you die.

This is not really something you manually ever do or you can but not something that is needed for survival as all cells are programmed to always survive that's the ultimate goal for all living things and its not by choice Aaaand now I’m manually breathing, thanks a lot guy Happened to me one night and I woke up just as my homie was about to hit me with the narcan. Said my breaths were so shallow. Mixed emotions I felt soooo fucked up and guilty about being pissed he was going to narcan me.I thought i died once.

I didn’t tell anyone.

And had heard that it takes about two minutes for yr brain to shut down from lack of oxygen.

I just laid there and waited

I’m still waiting,But in reality its a reflex but opiates etc dampens this but I don't think you actually manually are doing it or you will not live but just get that feeling. To consciously stop breathing is not easy and even opiates on their own isn't actually that easy to cause it either..

Its your brain � gray matter doing it and making you aware of the fact your breathing and you'll start thinking if I stop focus on breathing ill dieIn hospital nurses kept coming over and telling me to breath because like, I just forgotYeah it be scary too :( Shit happens to me sometimes even when I’m sober Yeah. Had only smoked h before last night night, then I snorted about how much I usually smoke. Shit had me laying down drifting between consciousness, having to make sure I was remembering to breath whenever I could. Good times...Once I was at a party, I had taken nearly half a gram of dihydrocodeine over the course of the day with little tolerance, had drunk an obscene amount, and smoked cigarettes whenever they were available. Even if I was really really trying hard I couldn't get more than a few slow shallow breaths out. Ended up having to buy a tactical line of coke to stimulate my lungs back into functioning. Scary shit though.Oh yeah definitely a few timesTalking strictly weight lmaoo*half gasps / chokes after accidentally not breathing for a minute and a half*

benzos are funDo you mean mixing opiates with alcohol?It happens a shit tonIf I snort a lot of ECP, I’ll be laying in bed for a few minutes and only breathe once or twice. My girlfriend has to remind me to keep breathing.Yeah sometimes. A lot in the past, great times.I feel like this meme was made in reference to weed. Cannabis alters your perception, and you often *notice* breathing, thus going into "manual breathing mode." This can cause anxiety, reinforcing the breathing thing and causing a "panic attack" in a worst case scenario.

Your not in danger, just tweaking out. 

Some of the post-JWH series cannabinoids were beta receptor agonists and did this a lot more than THC does, and I've ridden out my fair share of "manual breathing mode" experiences as a result. (Some of the later compounds were actually dangerous and cardiotoxic, which I found out later. But like AM2201 was pretty safe, just tweaky.)

I've never done enough CNS depressants to have respiratory depression, but it sounds terrifying, as well as actually dangerous. 

Cannabinoids make you *think* you are at risk of forgetting to breath, but it's purely psychological. Opiates can actually make you *really* forget to breathe.Back in like 2011 I used to just lay down relaxing, half falling asleep, then suck in air in a panic because I haven't taken a breathe in well over a minute. Then I have to focus on taking breathes. Repeat.Counting and breathing.  I've done this a bunch.I use to study neuroscience in high school. Promethazine is a antihistamine but its also an Anti-cholinergic. That means if you take 10-20 times the recommended dose, it will have delierant effects. Delierants are a class of hallucinogens that will make you see things that are not there, think you are talking when you are not, and have vivid, realistic hallucinations. I personally would NEVER drink copious amounts of codeine/promethazine. I have such a tolerance to opioids that in an attempt to get a codeine buzz I would probably be having a nightmare trip off the promethazine. Man just take some vicodin. LolMe neither, although the only times I've taken promethazine I was mixing it with IV heroin, fentanyl or morphine so maybe it's not as dramatic with codeine. But goddamn, it really does depress your breathing like a motherfucker - made me feel like I was closer to OD'ing than benzo and opioids ever do. Not a whole lot more euphoric or fun than just opioids by themselves. 

&#x200B;

But I guess it's probably very different for people who don't have huge opioid tolerances, don't inject their shit and can still get really high off of codeine. Honestly I regret having developing such a tolerance - codeine is really damned fun when you have no tolerance and I can only imagine the promethazine mix produces some nice results. Lean looks like such a great time, but I'm convinced that I'd have to take way more than I'm comfortable taking to get any kind of results. But I remember back in the day me and my ex would buy a shit ton of Tylenol 1s (the one with codeine in them, not sure if they're still available OTC or what but we used to just load up our cart with that shit) and bring them home and separate the codeine from all the filler and acetaminophen (distill?). We'd end up with this foul tasting liquid we used to mix with various fruit drinks -- consume them ourselves and sell them at a large mark up to our friends. Good times. If only we'd had some promethazine to throw in there and we could have made a killing chopping lean. Weak opiate potentiated by the prometh = okay buzz if you don’t shoot dope or pop percs all day. I’ve done percs and ion fw them but I’ll Po a 4 whenever That’s kind of how some CPAP machines (Auto Servo ventilators) work. If the machine senses you haven’t taken a breath in a while, it will give you a quick push of air through the mask. This ‘reminds’ your brain to breathe. Weird flex but okYeh, you'll just be sitting there and suddenly you'll start gasping and you realise that you weren't breathing for like a minute Me too tbh I was just wondering about this as I recently got hooked up with a CPAP machine. Does a CPAP machine reduce/eliminate the respiratory depression effects of opiates?Or you have taken so much YOUR ODing and will need autobreathing but from a machineDont ever use a stimulant like that again, thats how mac miller died. His autopsy revealed he had coke and fentanyl in his body. But the amount of fentanyl in him was not fatal not the amount of coke was, but because they were mixed together they were a fatal dose. I always thought uppers would cancel out downers but it seems thats not the case �Damn I never thought about it but I do take a lot of deep breaths when I’m on a bunch of em too lolz i catch myself sighing a lot more than usual I did not know that I don't feel so bad now lolWhat's ecp?So it's only their perceptions. I understand now. When I used to do dilaudid 8mg at a time, 4-8 times a day and then take klonopin and soma then smoke bud. So relaxed that I gotta remember to breath. Glad to off dilaudid tho. That addiction nearly cost me my life everyday. Everyday. No rush can ever compare to that shit. Opiates actually suppress your breathing in your brain, its not that you forget to breath its that you physically cantDefinite weed meme but I like how it can be interpreted in different ways Aye so are you saying that smoking something with more thc and less of the other cannabinoids will give you less anxiety? This actually was posted on a weed page. But this is much more fitting for opiates seeing as large doses of painkillers makes it hard for your body to detect CO2, meaning your body doesnt think it needs to breathe.We're you frightened? Yeah, i wouldnt either it's just as simple to get stuff without it and take a reasonable dose to combat itch etc. It is smoother than benadryl at low doses imo. Your mouth gets so fucking dry at high doses that you have to mentally guide yourself to swallowing and breathing after too much. It weirds me out that some people down the shit with codiene. Like fuck. Isn’t that T3’s? I remember I used to do that with those. And even Vicodin. Shit tasted so foul however.You were makin homebrew my g � codeine after the APAP is out + a lil first gen antihistamines + Karo man.. that’s good homebrew Anxiety maybe?It doesn't no, when a respirator is what breaths for ODs while a cpap would do the trivk too? Nah unlikely Not sure if it does anything but it makes me feel better knowing that I stop breathing that at least some air is being jammed up my nose and hopefully making it to my lungs to keep me alive and unbraindead till my breathing kicks in or somebody notices I'm in distress. Though I usually go to manual as the original post states and the cpap sure helps on manual.Well they can do that too, (battle slow and shallow breathing) cocaine however seems not very beneficial because it starts off so quick. 

in small doses to my understanding thrt do cancel or convert symptoms but also puts amextra strain in other areaas as the heart while fentanyl iis rapidly eliminated if one makes it an hour almost half the dose would be eliminated already, adrenaline is known for being abke to stop a person fainting from pain if in a bad situation as well stims and sedatives do counter each other and if one wears out faster than the other its not good either.


One of the major issues of concern is the potential to overdose on one of the drugs as a result of taking two drugs that have different mechanisms of action. Buprenorphine, even though it is a partial opioid agonist, still has central nervous system depressant effects, and as a stimulant, Adderall results in increased central nervous system activity. When taken in combination, these two drugs cancel out some of the effects of each other, and individuals may not believe that they are achieving the desired psychoactive effects from either drug. This can lead to the potential for overdose as the person may take more to experience the effects. The situation would be most problematic in an individual who is attempting to abuse or misuse both drugs, and not in an individual who is prescribed both drugs and using them at recommended dosages.Because the buprenorphine would curb the stimulant effects of the Adderall, it would be expected that one would be more likely to overdose on Adderall than on buprenorphine; however, the situation can certainly be reversed. Overdosing on Adderall would result in a number of issues, including:

The potential for paranoia and hallucinations

Increased aggression and restlessness

Increased heart rate and blood pressure

Increased potential for heart attack or stroke

The potential for seizures

Shit, really? I thought the danger was if you took a fatal dose of downers and the uppers were all that were keeping you alive, didn't realise they can be fatal when each individually wouldn't.Opiates are arguably the most dangerous drugs out there, because both the high and the OD potential they have. They're too enjoyable and too murderous to be meddled with. It's hard to get into a recreational use without risking a more dependant usage.East coast powder, also known as china white. Its heroin mixed with fentanyl. Very light tan colorSlang for East Coast (USA) Powder..
AKA powdered #4  Heroin commonly found in the Northeastern United StatesWith weed? Absolutely.

With some synthetic cannabinoids, they bind to beta receptors in a way that causes it. Basically causes anxiety in a neurophysiological way.

Both can be mitigated with controlled breathing, and ceasing the flow of thought to induce an alpha state to calm your brain down. This works for psychogenic panic attacks too.

I can actually lower my heart rate and BP at will. I was able to do so during a stimulant OD, and have also done it in other conditions where it was measurable. I get that "manual breathing" thing under those conditions, which is probably an anxiety/panic thing.

With opiates or other CNS depressants? You're actually forgetting to breathe for real, or at least that's my understanding.

Also, lowering your heart rate is probably the opposite of what you'd wanna do, lol. I only know how to mitigate the *illusion* of "forgetting to breathe." Maybe, but I remember the first time I mixed a big dose codeine and xanax when I didn't have tolerance to either I was able to breath just fine if I mentally thought about it otherwise it just didn't seem like a priority for my brain at the time.I’ve seen people say that you physically can’t breathe before when get too respiratory depressed yet loads of people here say they manually breathe so the two can’t both be true I wonder what one is (I think you’re right with can’t otherwise people wouldn’t say it’s impossible to narcan yourself during a OD).I'm talking about synthetic cannabinoids, aka "spice." I smoked a LOT of spice from 2010 to 2013, some of it homemade from pure chem powders and leafy herb blends.

Many were trippy af. Had spiritual experiences and such with them.

They kept banning wave after wave of noid chems, so eventually all that was left were nasty ass cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic compounds. That's why I eventually stopped using them.They actually just shut down your brains autonomous response to breathe by depressing the central nervous system too much after one overdoses.Hell know, I was high as fuckRight like Lil pump says he drinks like a bottle a day. There’s no way because that promethazine will make you go absolutely bonkers. Thats a recipe for a baker act lolOver here you get cyclizine OTC, 50-100mg potentiates pretty good and I don't get a shitty hangover the next dayI know what you mean. I’ve got both obstructive and central sleep apnea, and the machine they gave me is supposed to help breath for me during central apneas. I asked the doc how it does that and they said basically by simulating my breathing patterns, by pushing some air in, then releasing the pressure it triggers the breathing response in the brain. I specifically asked them if it would act as a full on ventilator, and all the said was “it can”

Rightly or wrongly, just like you, I feel better going to sleep high when I’m hooked up to the machine. Me either, but i did some research and it turns out to be the opposite. Now i feel like an idiot for taking adderall every time I thought I took it way too far with the ECPECP is not China white anymore. China white is just fent. And not all ECP has fent, I've definitely gotten just brown. Thank you. This sounds like an animal profile in Red Dead 2. 

 But for dope. Ohhhh. OkI can see a scenario where both may be true, just at different stages or "levels" of the high. 

The impossible to narcan yourself one generally occurs when you pass out before you know its coming, or at least realize its about to hit like a train without enough time to do anything except pass out. In this scenario you would be unable to hit yourself with narcan prior to falling out.  In these instances you have no choice but to rely on those with you (if you're not alone) or being fortunate enough to wake up on your own

The other situation is where youre super high, possibly on the cusp of passing out/OD but not quite. Your breathing becomes extremely infrequent. If you have a person with you they may say something about your minimal breathing or, lack thereof.  At this point you may have become consciously aware of your situation and  be able to enter into a sort of manual breathing mode. Sounds like what people report from high doses of dimenhydrinate. I've done high doses of diphenhydramine, but Dramamine sounds like a whole different ball game.I dont like cyclazine but better than a lot. I've been prescribed it briefly but I just dont like anti cholinergics. When I take the correct dose of promethazine the hangover shit isnt so bad but benadryl or anything else basically it is worse. Cyclazine is mild compared to benadryl. Weird that beandeyl is more common in the us but of course benadryl is better for many allergies. 90% of ECP has fent. Its drug economics. If heroin is $24,000 a pound, and fentanyl is $7,000 a pound; as a drug trafficker you could add lactose, fent, and heroin to make the same potency as a dime bag of heroin, and save a lot of money. And where i’m from china is still heroin and fent together. Very rare to find pure fent, seeing as two grains of salt is a deadly amount.Haha that feeling when they sounded so smart, but they actually just crazy Lmao, yeah dude it’s all psychological somatic go from auto to Manual if you slow down your breathing to about 30 breaths per minute in a period while your blood is about 96.852 degrees Fahrenheit, to my calculations this will also work for panic attacks. Just gotta go from the beta state to alpha state and score 3 basket ball hoops and you should be good to go. 

And no I’m not being serious about this I’m just acting like the dude who commented before � who actually probably knows his shit tbh. As someone who has taken a high dose I can personally attest to how weird it is.  You will hallucinate, and I was seeing/hearing things and for like a day afterwards everything felt really weird like I was viewing everything I did in third person.We don't have soma in South Africa, but we have meprobamate it's a metabolite of soma. Not sure if it's would work the same but meprobamate is the only thing imo that makes codeine feel amazing. 3 or 4 400mg equanils an hour before your normal codeine dose and you're laying in one spot with your eyes closed in euphoria.Obviously China white isn't pure fent. Typically it's fent and a cut. And it's not 2 grains. That's carfent. I'm not even going to argue this whatever HahaOkYeah, I've never heard much of anything positive about it. I take a lot of DPH and I do DXM about once a month or so, so I mean, I fuck with OTC psychoactives. I'm sitting here coming down off a DXM afterglow from yesterday.

But dimenhydrinate is something where I don't think I've ever heard a particularly positive trip report. It's up there with datura on the "shit I don't fuck with" list. Probably a lot safer than datura, tbh, but neither sound all that appealing to me. I'm rather interested in the realistic nature of the hallucinations people get, though.

Jsyk, the "third person" thing sounds like a pretty typical depersonalization/derealization experience. I got that kind of thing a lot as a kid and it freaked me the fuck out when I was like 8, lol. Had a straight-up existential crisis in the 2nd grade. 

As an adult, though, I eventually learned that 1.) brains are weird af, and unified selfhood is a brain deal; and 2.) there's still a hell of a lot we don't even know yet about those things.

Fucking with the brain can cause some WEIRD shit, as far as selfhood and perspective goes. You can LITERALLY BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE, like subjectively. It's called Heautoscopy, and it's been documented in a few cases of people with temporal lobe or temporoparietal localized partial seizures. It's like, you're seeing your double, but you ARE both doubles. Like, at the same time. People have attempted suicide because it freaked them out that much.Dude this guy is a fuking moron lmfao... I get mad at the idiots I see posting false info on here, it’s almost too funny to comment on a lot of the timeNeither am i because clearly you’re a special kinda stupid if you think 2 milligrams (MILLIONTH OF A GRAM) is more than two grains of salt. Byee � there are 1000 mg in a gram so that would be 1/500 of a gram you stupid mother fucker lmaoWhat the fuck are you even talking about? Just a reminder that OP was being cheeky and was actually wrong af lol. God I love going through my old Reddit history. People think they’re so right but they’re actually dumber than the people they’re trying to “educate”  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: thought you guys may enjoy this, Content: , ups: 796, downs: 0https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page helps with that process.This. This right here is the kinda shit I strongly felt r/drugs was missing, thank you for the laugh.Tfw no crazy junkie gf � My dude was like “this is backwards for us”So many years of this. Except reverse because I had all the drug experience. Girl right here and yes this is true!Might be hard if too many opiates are in the mixCrossfaded ? lol I haven't heard that since 2001.

For us real junkies, it's more, "Me trying to figure out the maximum amount I can hide for myself for later, and your girl, just super excited to get another speedball shot.that moment when you realize you're so far into your addiction, that you're sex drive is completely diminished 15 mg valium and 8 beers? Fuck it let's see.Sex is exactly what you can't do while on opiates. Lol r/drugs is where this should beThat shit is all too real and exactly how I be thinking everyday...�‍���

I am going to steal this pic bro, sorry, it’s too funny!how accurate this is for my girl and i is crazy lol This has literally been my weekend 10/10 can relateIF THIS AIN'T MEI've been doing this for years with many women I've never seen this posted anywhere as I just assume we all use it. It's like my Bible. So if you don't already, you should check it out before trying anything new.What..Good memes and people who don’t think they are the supreme badasses? r/drugs is just people who think taking drugs is edgy and cool. They just wanna get internet good boy points, that's also the reason why they talk down on other users Two junkie relationships later, there was some great times but its playing with fire. Highs are high, lows are really damn devastating. 

Now, even if I'm using, I steer clear of fellow junkie gals. Clean(ish) gfs means a lot less drama, and a lot less spiraling out of control, unhealthy codependency, stealing and lying to each other, replacing sex with drugs (and maybe a half assed attempt at sex). Heroin and cocaine fueled lover's spats can get rough. why you gotta shit on the funny meme man ��You can still fuck just might have some problems getting off... coke on the other hand you might just go soft Yes,  I too have the sex/r/ihavesexI post it every chance I get, alot of people don't know about it.It's a wiki with just about every drug listed with effects, and what it is dangerous to mix with .No longer shall we stand for overdosing on weed, endless amounts of prescription pills, and the barrage of downvotes on exceeding maximum doses!! 

In all seriousness, there really should be a alternate r/drugs where the rest of the hard drug community can bond in peace (r/opiates, r/stims, and whatever else I have to sub to).That part.Thanks for this man you give perspective to a fellow lost soulSee, for me, its exactly backwards, I can get hard on coke but not finish and can't even get up on opiates, but I think the boner ability is because I take agmatine to combat the vasoconstriction.Even when I was with my ex for 4 years her friends would have me split up their shots for them I didn't have sex with all of the women I prefer to be in a relationshipI know I’m 150 days late, but this is a super handy thing to have on hand too: https://wiki.tripsit.me/images/3/3a/Combo_2.pngGreat comment then, thank you! Everyone be safe Just don't let r/lsd inLol oh okay I thought you were talking about having sex. But yeah, I too prefer sex with someone I’m in a relationship with. Never been one to like or understand those who like sleeping with someone they barely know or don’t like quite a bit or love A place where people brainwash themselves, my favourite drug but God damn do I hate the community for the most partIt doesn't even exist yet and we already turned on one another LOL.

Maybe I'm just looking for a place that everything I use is there (other than home that is).Ya I didn't think about that it sounds like I was bragging about sex I really wasn't I was talking about measuring out the dope
YeahI don't want people who think one substance is better than another, or people who hate substance abusers. The weed subreddits do it r/lsd does it, and r/drugs do it.Interesting enough though this sub hates on that community like that community hates on this one... so r/opiates is doing exactly what they dont like about r/drugs...Huh, knew that about r/drugs but damn, alright yea, no involving ourselves with that shitI don't hate all of r/drugs but there are so many people who hate substance abusers and people who use "harder" substances it gets annoying. I almost feel it's inevitable when you get that big. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Painfully real, Content: , ups: 793, downs: 0Laughs in NJfuck man, there was little I hated more than a windy winter day when I was sick back in indiana. especially the last place I lived since the gas station on my route to highway was on the outskirts of town surrounded by open fields with nothing to block that biting wind. having to step out into -20 wind-chill covered in a layer of sweat is some truly wack shit. 

but the hour drive back home from the city was almost always pretty tight. usually just me and the old running partner/best friend... so we'd finally score and find a suitable parking lot to get well. of course he hits a vein on the first attempt and sits there nodding with a cig while I struggle to find a vein, waking back up every five minutes or so to calm me down a bit and point out that the more frustrated I got the harder it would be.

if it was a good day and I managed to hit within a few minutes we'd usually move to a different parking lot to chill out and smoke a couple cigs. if it was a bad day and I took forever we just hopped back on the highway headed back home.

honestly I miss having a running partner. during the first 8 years of drug use it was almost always with my close friends. we lived an hour away from the city so carpooling was the only way any of us could afford to pick up every day or every other day. 

never had to worry about that shit back in the days of the old school oxys. I could buy oc 80s, 60s and 40s from like 5 different old ladies in my rural af hometown before they switched to the bullshit OPs and everybody just started doing dope instead.

but uh yeah, anyway. I guess my point is I also don't like the cold when I'm sick.I once bought .37 worth of gas with pennies... Got to the spot but ran outta gas on the way back.Man I truck burns a gallon of gas just sitting at a stop light It do be like that sometimesI've been there so many times, back b4 i pawned my carHow sad, but true. Ughhh I had a dealer who would text me as I’m on the way to get well again making me stop to buy him some random grocery like a gallon of milk, 3 boxes of Jell-o or a giant bottle of Mountain Dew. This is when he knew I was sick w/WD and jonesing like mad!!! I would grit my teeth and text  back, “ok” and wanna KILL HIM. I’d barely have strength to even drive there, let alone go stop off to shop for him! FuckMy boy doin this rn. I got to stay home watching hardcore Henry on Netflix I’m so lucky 

By the way I SO recommend, like, more than anything it’s excellent so much action and gore and ... ya just watch it...Story of my life manDude I’ve been there too with .25 cents. So embarrassing. What a life?!?Me in Cali except it’s fuckin 3.39Saw this last night at 2 am it was -20 c

&#x200B;I saw this on insta and laughed for like 5 mins solid bc it's my fucking life. Living out in the country, nothing is within walking distance. LMAO OMG THEM SHIVERS. FrfrWhat does it mean to be sick? For real. But the flip side is that we have to ask the gas attendant to put in a ridiculously low amount of gas in, and I dont know about you, but I always felt like they knew what was up. Are you laughing cause you don't have to get out of the car?They wont even take less than a dollar where im at lolWho remembers the guy who traded his car for a couple hundred dollars of oxy lmaoHow much ya get?

Sold a MacBook pro w retina fir 300, paid over 2k . That or the elite series of a tv fir like 200, was worth like 4k or something. My worst You get extras for buying him that shit and the extra time you put in, right? Otherwise find a new plug. A+ usernameYou maybe need to go home. This is not the place for you bro....Dopesick, presumablyI grew up in Jersey. And yeah I always felt ashamed when I had to ask for $2 of regular LMAO.That’s goes for anyone in any state. If you only have a handful of change you still have to go to the clerk and ask them to put whatever amount on whatever number tankhahahaha i felt the same way when i would bring 7 dollars in pennies and shit just to make it across town and back from the plug.[deleted]Ooof found out where i am they also require 1 dollar minimum. There was one dude who said he traded his car for like 6 norcos...he had a picture of them in the palm of his hand hahahaThats some old school reddit opi shit lmao.... I remember that for sure though, who could forget!!!? LmFAO the handful of norcos he posted who remembers that lolololFor real???I remember that threadhaha for some reason I thought it was Opanas lolThats weird i sold a 2017 mac book pro for the same price except it was my friend's... Or exfriend obviously�i got $1500 for the mazda 3. That and many years of regret.I've been asked to do shit like that so often.  Well, not asked, more like required. It was the requirement for being allowed to show up and park and sit in someone's driveway, parking lot, or street near their spot. That way you got some reason for being there, "here, I got that swisher wrap and chocolate milk you've been dying for". Also used to cover up the hand to hand exchange so anyone looking won't see the bag get handed off, since it'll be hidden beneath whatever you've been asked to bring.

I've only ever been asked to do this when I'm going into someone's neighborhood and either the plug is paranoid and/or the neighbors are nosy.

Whatever money I spent either got added to the bag or the bag just cost less. Ty, was from opiophile if u know what that is. The OG forum basically . So old, it’s gone now. There before blue light, before Reddit, before most other drug forum. They’d only allow one to create an account at Random unannounced times 2 weeks per year 

So it take years of lurking to finally get on there if u were lucky. It took me 5-6 yrs to get a login finally. Made sure there were no casual idiots on it. Shit was the best til the guy that ran it finally spent the server money on dope for the first time in like 2 decades it was sad. Run on donations. They had all the best usernames because like I said we had like 6 years to think of themI figured as much, but did not have a word for it. Thanks.

But is it slang or is it actually a physical feeling? I’ve slways wondered but never asked before. What’s is it like to leave the state and pump your own gas? 

Do some people struggle with the concept? Oh yeah, this is true. Lol I grew up in New Jersey. First time going through Connecticut, I sat in the car at the gas pump for 10 min.Do you tip them each time #OrNaw?It’s in the side bar under the epic threads It was posted on this sub yeah hahaha i wish i could find itI remember it being oxy but maybe not, that'd be slightly less dumb tho lolI've had a dude who was paranoid about coming to my neighborhood. He was black and thought he stood out (he didn't at all and black people literally live on my street), but he would bring something random every time he delivered when it was day light. I'd get peanuts, armor-all, air fresheners, and other random gas station shit.

He was my main dudes nephew and I think he was super sketched about getting arrested. It was also sad because he was like 19 and already had kids. I could tell he didn't want to do what he was doing but he did it to provide for his kids.  That’s what matters to me. What you said last. That’s perfect and a great idea of stealthy drug trade. But if it was just abuse of kindness hellnawit’s fucking hellish. you have never felt that bad in your life and you never will. it’s the worst thing i’ve ever felt. Flu like sickness brought on from opiate withdrawal. Well documented for many decades. Once you do your pill you're body reaches homeostasis again. Ive never been addicted but i drove alot of addicts to grab there pill while in deep sickness and they really do look sick. Pale, sweaty skin, sometimes vomiting until they get their pillFrom what I know (someone who's never done heroin) it's the physical feelings of minor withdrawals

Edit: guess I'm stupid �Trust me, there are more people struggling with the concept of *not* having to pump.I’m don’t live in Jersey but twice I was on the PA turnpike & had to help people pump.  Both times they were young women and had no idea how to do it.  Mid eighties is when the gas stations around us became self serve. My mother has only pumped her own gas twice in her entire life because she was married to my dad by that time. She will literally come home close to empty and have my dad drive it up to the gas station to fill her up. A couple times as a teen I had to pump her gas for her if we were out and about together. I tried teaching her but she didn't give a flying Fuck to pay attention. She's gonna be so screwed if he dies first Dont listen to them. Pumping gas sucks cock. You get gas on your shit. You walk around in formal gear and people are asking you why you smell like gas. Due to leaky fucking pumps. No one should have to pump their own gas. We need to leave that to the professionals and people who wear clothes that are already skunky.

Edit: Fuck you people who down voted me.I dreaded going into putting under a dollar of change In my tank every nightOpposite happened to me when I visited family in Jersey. Got out to pump the gas for my dad and got about as far as getting the pump in the car, then heard some gas station attendant yelling "stop, stopppp!" HahaNaw.
In Oregon we also don't pump our own gas. Never have I ever seen anyone tip the attendant. Sometimes though, at certain gas stations, I think it might be Chevron, the attendant will wash your windshield while you wait. Then sometimes someone might tip.

I always feel this weird sort of embarrassment or shame when the employee is washing the window and I'm just sitting there like trying not to make eye contact. I usually enforce that boyfriend tips, since he's the driver, whenever this happens.haha who knows. Maybe at the time I was internally hoping it was opana for his sake and then remembered it that way.Damn. Intense Its sad you all do this to yourselvesy’all lost?Thank you for sending_it Yup. I was dumbfounded when I found out pumping your own gas is illegal there. Still am honestly. What death or catastrophic event occurred for it to be made illegal?I live in Florida and my grandmother never learned to pump gas. I remember driving around forever, looking for a full service station. �[deleted]Wow it sounds like your mom is just making things like 10x more complicated and difficult for herself. I don’t think anyone taught me how to pump gas, it’s prettt self explanatory. It’s like the same concept as turning on a faucet or getting soda out of a fountain even though they’re different setups. She must think it’s like way more involved than it actually is and not want to learn cause then she’d have no excuse to not do it herselfI’ve been pumping my own gas since the early 80’s I can count on three fingers the number of times I’ve gotten gas on me.  Keep purel in the glove box, smell problem solved.  Man up.  Mass has both. It's a weird experienceI always feel like I should tip them. My aunt says she doesn’t, but she lives there. Also I’m only ever in NJ for the holidays when it’s cold as shit. Child, don’t judge things you do not understand.  nobody wants to be an addict. The fuck outa here with that shit ‘birdeey’[deleted]It’s not a safety thing it’s a job thing. It's an insurance thing mostly. Something about how they rates are lower because they're full service. Had someone to do with the population density if I remember when they were training us. Creates jobs too. In Virginia we used to have gas stations with a single lane that was full service and the rest were self serve. In the 80s, all gas stations had full service pumps, slowly over time less and less of them had full service pumps. Now in 2018 all gas stations here are 100% self serve. 

I bet if you opened a station in VA that had 100% full serve and had girls on rollerskates pumping the gas with the HESS colors , white t-shirts with a green miniskirt and tight white bootie shorts, you’d make a fucking killing. 

[Hess service station for adults.](https://i.imgur.com/9hYIGqt.jpg)My grandma was exactly the same. My Grandpa always made sure she had a full tank, lol The woman gave me life so I would definitely help her if she ever needed it. Plus she is such a kickass grandma to my kids that I'd have no problem running up for her while we all visit, but it's just more of a hassle for her to not learn herself. She's a very smart woman too which is why I don't get it. Yeah she tends to do that with a couple other things, like plugging in the Comcast to watch Netflix on the main TV. We wrote down instructions to a T and she still drives my sister crazy asking her to do it. 

The first time she pumped her own gas was when she was 9 months pregnant and with her foreign mother in law. My grandma was asking random men to help them and my mom says it was an embarrassing moment to figure it out, I think it was on an older pump too. She was shocked when I asked for her card and swiped at the pump! She really had no idea you didn't have to go inside to pay � That doesn't solve the problem of stepping on it and your shoes smelling like it for the rest of the night.Lived and worked in Jersey for a while as a gas station attendant at Wawa.  People would tip all the time. Loved it. Especially around the holidays. People always talk about the "physical" symptoms.  Though they are terrible, it is the "mental" part that fucks w me.  Sooooo depressed--like the end of the world hopelessness.  Soooo "introspective" (which can be kinda fun/ good / interesting), so... just terrible.  On top of that, most poeple (me) CANNOT sleep.  No matter what.  The ONLY thing which will give you that relief is an opiate.  

Add to that what others said:  especially the nausea.  You CANNOT eat.  I CANNOT even *drink* anything w/o puking--at least during the worst of it (around 36 hours or so).  My only hope is (if possible where I am) to lie in the shower until the hot water runs out, then just lie there until it become warm again--repeat.  That, or watch movies.  Talking to other humans is epsecially helpful during this stage, though, ost, unless they know what's up, will not likely want to be near you. 

There are multiple, accurate portrayals of heroin addiction and its sickness.  I think the most accurate I've ever watched was *Panic in Needle Park* (it's an older film--1970s) starring Al Pacino.  Really good, but, ofc ourse, quite depressing.  That does sound awful I'm confused, is that shorts under the miniskirt? What's the point no one would see them cause the skirt would be in the way[deleted]She knows how to pump her own gas lol She is just playing dumb so that she doesn't have to do it. And if she pretends to let you teach her, then she will have to pump her own gas.Have been pumping my own gas in Philly for over a decade and a half, this doesn’t happen to people. You’re tripping.I get the mental shit first and I end up not even caring about the physical as much. I had ways to ease some of the symptoms but I wouldn't even want to eat or drink anything in the first place. I used to dry heave until  sticky yellow bile would come out. So glad I'm clean almost a year now. Fuck that state of mind.I'm with you in the shower thing. I would drive my ex crazy getting up every hour and a half to go back in until the hot water ran out again. You could tell by our utility bill when we had a rough month by our water bill going up So does sexfartI meant to say “[Boy Shorts](https://goo.gl/images/KaqQNe)” which are a type of women’s underwear. I mean, they’re gonna be outside, they probably want underwear under their skirts. The girls need their dignity. 

The skirts in my imagination are not right but like more open and comfortable to skate in. [Like this. ](https://www.charlotterusse.com/pleated-scuba-skater-skirt-302557907.html?mrkgcl=776&mrkgadid=3037755296&cid=ps:nonbrand:Google&product_id=302557907&adpos=1o5&creative=227505038395&device=m&matchtype=&network=s&gclid=CjwKCAiAuMTfBRAcEiwAV4SDkd7zM6xzLwUGWsr_z1NUIrckPBd312mcAVS1fRjoOQLb7DFeNp9nwRoCJ48QAvD_BwE)I guess you would see the bloomers (not bootie shorts) when the girls bend over, like cheerleaders wear. Thanks, I'm actually a girl but I'm still taking the compliment! My mom battled cancer when I was a teen so my sister turned down a scholarship to be close to her. She's healthy now but I feel same as you do about moving far away, it isn't worth it. 

Growing up we spent every Sunday visiting both of my grandparents one after the other for the afternoon. Once I got to a certain age I was annoyed by the "tradition ruining my weekend" but still went. Once my mom's mother died, my aunts who barely saw my grandma all felt so guilty. They visit her grave all the time and regret not seeing her. They wanted her stuff to remember her by, but we have actual good memories with her. I made it a point after that to see my dad's mom regularly. We celebrated her 95th birthday last Sunday! 

Sorry for getting way off topic here, but family isn't around forever and it's great you value your time with them now! So you're saying gas never leaks on the ground or out of the nozzle down your car? That's complete and absolute bullshit. I no longer live in Jersey and pump my own has every day practically. What your claiming is bullshit. Hell just yest I watched some teenager pull the nozzle out prematurely and spray has all along the side of his car and on the ground.Hahah nice :)Maybe let your tard wrangler do it instead. Do you also fling food and drink everywhere during feeding time?Maybe if ur an idiot it happens but if u have half a brain it's not hard to keep it clean... just takes some god damn common sense is all... 

Make sure the pump isn't fucked up b4 using, put the nozzle in as far as possible b4 pumping, keep ur hand away from the lever/trigger when removing the nozzle and watch where u step when ur walking around a pump... not rocket science, and if a few drops get on ur car or urself, it's called paper towel or a rag. 

Oh but wait, if u really wanna show off ur common sense gas pumping skills, when ur done pumping, if u push in or up (depending on the design of the gas pump) on the little metal flap that moves when u stick the gas pump nozzle back into the holder on the machine, it will shut off the pump and not allow u to pump anymore gas without paying again first so this would keep from any accidents happening between u removing the nozzle from ur car and putting it back into its holding slot on the machine. 

I will say tho that the video clips of people driving off from the pump with the nozzle still in their car are fucking hilarious when they show them on the news... like u gotta be absent minded af to do some shit like that... or extremely high.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Way too accurate, Content: , ups: 788, downs: 0For me, this is just me sober (past 30 days as well)For me it’s when I start to think about how I got to this point. the struggles a head how I wish I could magically have 6 months go by. I hate the mental part. First year sober*This is too right. Ugh I just want my energy back. The hardest part for me is having no fucking energyDamn I miss this show. Me at work,  right now...Eating food: this taste like shit 
Listening to music: this doesn’t sound good 
Watching tv: this isn’t entertaining. I’m anxious 

Relapsing? Sounds amazing. 

Ah yes. Life returns. It's you. It's that shit stuck under my shoe, it's that smell inside the van, it's my bed sheet covered with sand ...fr after one year dry, those relate more to my drinking than sobriety. hang in there y’allThis is me everyday sober. Does it ever not feel this way...¡¡¡All y'all need VIVITROL!!!It really do be like that sometimesSame here ! Get through the physical part is hard but the mental part is the worst ohh gosh i’m 5 days sober and The depression is awful .. It does come back. Took me about six months. No joke. Get a prescription for vyvanse.That was the worst for me as well. Having low energy was one of the main reasons for getting into opiates. When it was taken away I became an unbelievable slob. The wierd thing was my mind was still going so I read a lot of books, which also helped with the depression.That first shot in the morning just gets you up and ready to face the world. Such a good energy boost. yes!!! I’m glad I’m not alone. The lack of energy energy is the WORST part of it Check dailymotion. The 90s are there.I just did a shot in the bathroom at work. Now in just sitting on the toilet relaxing before I go back into the kitchen and work. I literally only ate Reese’s puffs, apples, and ice cream which are foods I’ve never liked otherwise. 

Watching tv was barely less excruciating to make the time pass than watching paint dry. Ah, great song, only realized recently that it was about kicking dope, since loving it since I was 13 or 14 (I'm in my 30s, BTW).I aint gettin I aint gettin outta bed todayUntil u get in a car wreckThey need to re-up their natural endorphin production. Not fucking block it. You sound like those drug court shit bags Good for you man!!!! 5 days, feels like it’s been 2 weeks don’t it?. If you are trying to get clean, and ur about go see the man, just remember how long and hard it was just to get to 5 days. And if you fuck up, that’s part of it too. Sometimes we need to fuck up a few times to realize it’s not worth it.  I got 4 weeks and I got downvoted like a mother fucker but adderall is what helped me. Got me moving and productive. Hmm? Kinda like that dope I was banging or them 30s I was popping. Some people take Xanax but that just keeps you lying down and when we’re lying down, you can only sleep so much so what else is their to do? think . That’s fucked up mix, dope sick and thinking to much. But whatever it takes. I wish, my doctor will not give me anything addictive. He’s been my psych for 10 years and knows all the dirt I did...well a lot of the dirt haha. I got some addys a few days back and low mg like 5-10 helped but they are too expensiveI’m reading and watching a lot of docs. Fuck I watched “minding the gap” and cried. Like really cried. I’m not the crying type mind you, not the “manly” type but just was on opiates for so long I could never really cry. That’s another thing is the emotions; holy shit. It sucks because like you said, my mind is fucking rolling along but my body feels like I have weights on and am walking under water. I’m over itTell me about it. Wake ups were the best but I have kids now so...Risky, I once found an employee face down on the ground in the bathroom after nodding off. He was gone for 30min on a 10 min break. 

In retrospect, I should have fired him for drug use at work but he hooked me up instead so I let it slide. I'm 28. I fell in love with the riff of Greatest Hits; had to know the band, asked who made that song.

Now, many of their songs speak to me.Vivitrol actually blocks it? That’s kinda sounds bad if you’re actually trying to get clean with that. Sounds miserable It is a free country. What one doctor will not do? Another doctor will.

If your dumb ass gets addicted to every substance and never takes meds as prescribed, then you will have a hard knock life.Yeah, ticking all the boxes. I only realised how much was being suppressed after I quit. Sense of humour came back really strong, which was great. I used to sit watching stupid videos of people falling over and laughed myself silly. It got to the point that my wife started doubting my sanity but it felt so good to laugh again.Modern times call for modern solutionsThis happened to my best friend at work, pants down and everything. Except he overdosed+has a seizure or something. Had to call ambulance. He came to, and convinced the job that he just had a seizure, but they drug tested him. Funny thing is, he was doing straight fentanyl-which I guess didn't show up on the drug test, but marijuana did, so he got fired for weed. Even though he does have a seizure disorder, and technically weed would help that. Hahaha, amazing!Vivitrol stops alcohol addicts and opiate addicts from feeling the high of their drug. It will not prevent overdose. Why do you think police and fucked courts are completely in love with the garbage? Thank youYes! The only thing that got me through the first two weeks of subs was watching comedies and stupid YouTube vids but it did feel good to “feel”.  Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. They probably knew. Though it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. And the weed was a good enough reason to let him go.Oh that sucks... if someone somehow didn’t know that they could be just slamming or doing heroin till they OD and not realize it. Also Doesn’t it make alcohol addicts also puke it up too?
Honestly no clue. I’ve never known anyone or dealt with the drug court personally. It sounds terrible though. Everyone I met in rehabs that tried it hated eat. 

Also I heard they use something or the same thing for booze? Anti Abuse. 

Shit sucks. Subs or Done is the way to Vivtrol in concept seems like it would work well however it doesn’t help any mental aspects you’re not fixing or repairing a behavior just simply not allowing it idk. It was mentioned to me once and I said FUCK THATAnd Survive.  Some opiate addicts HAVE overdosed to death tryna overcome the vivitrol blockage. :-( Never be like them. Doctors warn not to do anymore opiates before they inject addicts with vivitrol, but  stupid mofos will take their chances regardless.


MANY booze-loving redditors report that naltrexone's side effects include mild nausea and dizziness the first couple of times it is taken orally. After day 3, it is usually smooth sailing.It's different than anibuse. Anibuse only makes you sick from alcohol. Vivitrol blocks endorphins. Apparently something happens to opioid receptors when you drink that makes ya wanna continue knocking em back. It's supposed to take the fun outta drinking along with everything else in your life. I've NEVER delt with drug courts personally but the one in my town forces that bullshit into your viens. Whilst having you do hard manual labor for community service. It's completely fucked. Most only last a few months. 2 people total. Like in the entire history of my towns drug court have completed it @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Dead ass teachers, Content: , ups: 776, downs: 0"Mooooom! Staaaahp! I don't want percs with my pb&j *again* :C"Just once I want someone to pop out of nowhere and be like, "hey man, wanna try heroin? First hit's free." Yes things like aspirin.advil and or a cup of coffee. Maybe a pull off a doobie or a mixed drink. These are the awesome free drugs you will be getting all the time!I sincerely blame the DARE program for doin more to fuck up my life than anything.  My school made us sit through quarterly DARE assemblies 1st to 12 th grade.

They made me believe all drugs would kill me, fry my brain cells, and turn me into a complete scum bag who'd shank my mother for a weed rock. No thats not a typo.

When you're young and only have access to biased information full of lies, misinterpretations, and just plain incorrect information, it's pretty much guaranteed anybody won't have the ability to understand the actual reality of the issue.


By the 10th grade, many of us realized nearly all of what we heard was bullshit.  Unfortunately, their abhorrent and preposterous misinformation had forced to think everything they said was a lie.  We believed it was just more lies and opiates were jus like weed, booze, coke, etc, hallucinogens....

Everyone partied hard with all those never having the substances effect their lives at disastrous levels. Maybe you got an under age or a weed possession/ parapahnaelia charge. Whoop dee doo. Pay a fine, do some community service, piss clean for at max a year for probation.


We still excelled at school, we still worked as many hours as allowed, we still had a part in society.


So opiates were just another drug to enjoy right....

Nope. Goodbye school. Forget about working. You have one job after dependancy....to score. More times than you'll ever imagine, at the worst times when you just want to die on a couch. You'll shit your pants, puke yellow bile on your lap in between relentless sneezing, all while trying to wipe your eyes enough to keep your swerving on the pavement, furthermore of importance, staying on the pavement so your bile puke soaks into your changeable clothes and doesn't permanently stank your car up.


If DARE would have been honest and told the truth, there's no way I would have eagerly jumped my way into daily opiate use. No way I would have picked up that needle.  I was happy with jus using everything else. I had over 15 K in the bank. A good job, a house, a car, a hott gf. I went on vacations and saw rock gods multiple times a week.



Now I do opiates. I don't have any real friends left who don't think they're superior to me and the rest chose tiny amounts of hard drugs over our friendships decades old.


I'm a typical situation. Society helped create me, yet they will do anything to make sure I disappear by having all odds thrown at me.

The second back stabbing,common to all my peers is the criminal,justice system.

It'd be a lot easier to stay clean if people had acceptable level paying jobs.....ahhh but ya see folks..... Remember those kids jus partying and smoking weed around college age?

 Guess what, that tiny weed charge that is supposed to be expunged and not visible in the future?

 Lies. You won't be getting hired without nepotism even with a internship and over 3.0 gpa. Why? Cause you once WERE A DRUGGY RAMPAGING ON MARIJUANA.

and yes, you served your mandated punishment, but nobody will find any merit with that. Also, youll be forced to pay 80% of your paycheck weekly toward paying for the privilege of probation, don't forget your fines! Ill add those are subjective and the judge can slam you for extra thousands for,your large cubic zirconia in your ear. After all, if you got a diamond that big kiddo....


So yes. You'll be paying for all this and for a middle aged disgruntled probation officer to bully you, take out his horrible life frustrations, and don't forget you're a target they actually have full power over..... When have people with unmonitored power ever decide that power doesn't suit them?

 So,You'll have to hand your piss over with a yes sir right after he stares at your dick and scrutinizes your urine.

You'll fail and owe mote fines, get probation extended, and finally last infraction serve out the whole recommended sentence of your crime.

Mine was a year and 8 months for having 6.8 grams of weed in one bag. I had it in my buttoned cargo pocket while I was  jogging for exercise in a neighborhood.....turns out some victim didn't tecognize me as livin near so as I was jogging by her house with a book bag on the police had 3 units take this hardened 20 year old down,

I was then held in the pouring rain for 4 hours, 12 at the station, all being interrogated without a phone call or allowed to leave. The affidavit stated I was running from the scene of a crime and when they stopped me to interview me I went for my wallet and pulled out a large bag of weed so now they had rights to search me.

They were convinced my old Chinese zune rip off was the walkie talkie I had warned my team with. They were utterly convinced.  I was,jogging to a buddies house a mile up the road.


Since that day I've been a criminal first to society. I get turned down for nearly every job despite having 2 degrees and one is a master's. In always over,qualified..... Yet I'm a accumulation of the charges they gave. A weed smoking burglar who had all charges except the weed thrown out. The search should have been to.


On top of that, I fight way harder than average Joe. After all, I picked up a heroin habit after probation forced me to stop smoking weed. I used it for anxiety. Every night since 14 after all obligations were completed.

I was forced to use drugs undetectable by urine after a few days. After all, every 2 weeks or month I pissed for this dipshit literally sniffing my piss for anything to bust me wit. Then he'd get a pat on the back and maybe have a chance at becoming a cop.....


Don't forget I'm paying for this probation...135 a month. Ohhhh I fail for weed one more time and I serve a year in jail? For 6.8 grams of weed? Hmmm ya. Looks like ill jus have to keep doing these opiates...

 I MEAN AFTER ALL, THEY'RE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER DRUG I'VE DONE AND USED. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC FOR ME TO LEARN FROM YET....

DON'T WORRY FUTURE ADULTS, ME AND MY FRIENDS BECAME THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC POSTER MODELS SO YOU ALL COULD LEARN FROM OUR HELL.

thanks DARE, thanks. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. You condemned millions of us and yet you still are out there every #day hounding us in any shape you can.  We would have been better off with a punishment of exile, a punishment of being ostracized.  Just like my boy Pericles. Saves all of western civilization only for jealous political enemies ( rich ones you can't forget) to call for a vote and then rig the results to ensure common birth born, humble hero of the battle at the straits of thalamus...ostracized for life so the poor lose their political voice and the rich take back all power.

Nothing has changed. Fuck you and your criminal justice system America. You have no morals. You have no ethics. You only have money.

Exhale. PhewSome people say cucumbers taste better pickled...I give my homie free H sometimes, so I can feel like I'm not the only one fucking up shit.No one is too cool for drugs. But you can definitely be NOT cool enough for drugs. For some reason, Michael Scott comes to mind lol. My mom used to say this, and it was true in some way, the first time I smoked weed was free, my first line of coke, well, multiple lines, were free, same with dope, the first time i did opis, my new friend at the time asked me if i knew what they were, i said no, and it was the truth, he gave me an 80mg oxy, i almost threw up at the school library, i was feeling so confident I asked a girl to go to prom with me.Clearly y’all never been in a Long Beach public bathroom. Meth as far as you can see. To be fair, first time I used weed and cocaine and opiates I did not have to pay. 

My friend hooked up my first few bags of weed. I got him back

First line of coke I ever did was pretty early on in life and it was after a shift at my first job when this 40 year old pulled me into the washroom stall with him and put a CD case in front of me with some shiny ass coke on it and said to do a line. Let me tell you that line was the best of my life, and it was free! I was 16 lol 

First opiate was codeine and Percocet tabs that my weed homie had and hooked me up with a baggie of like 10 percs and 20 t3 after I bought the guy fast food after a sesh 

But the coke was the only real, “hey come here kid and fuck up your life” I asked for the weed and pills 

Funny that I don’t do coke, only weed and pills to this day lolBeing a hot girl means getting tons of free coke but everyone's still always so stingy about opiates  :(Dead ass doctors ..Stoner's are great at sharing!! I'm pretty sure no one ever paid for their first sesh =)

My first few weed/pills/acid/shrooms/ coke were all free, actually- I've never paid for shrooms (they grow around here) or coke... (granted I've only had like 5 nights on coke- but I'm a downer kid ;) (& fuck I'd be fucked if I loved coke enough to buy it, the price of coke in Australia is fucking obscene..... which I guess means I should be even more grateful that folks wanted to fund me getting fucked up)



Hhheeeyyyyyyy, you guys would know the answer to this,


Would prescription oxycodone + prescription dexamphetamine = pharma speed ball?? 


(Have you done it? Was it any good? Is it actually dangerous, or just have a bad rep?)

Sure I can google things, but I like the personal stories  you folks can share ♡ ♤Good friends share!I haven’t taken up any offers I haven’t felt like having a solid conversation with a tree yet. Today was the first time in my 10 years of doing drugs, that a complete stranger gave me free drugs. Unfortunately doesn’t happen nearly as often as I was told it would happen. Well, I mean most females I know never spend a dime My best friend is like a 6’3 tattooed ken doll and he use to hook up with this butterface that was prescribed those 30mg ER adderal and she would always give him a handful after they hooked up and he always split them with me .. good ass friend 

Edit - thanks for the silver anon Wow I’ve never done that before, sure! If you live in a city with an open-air drug market the d boys throw out testers to get the word out on a new batch

Edit: got rid of locationYea and I don’t like smoking weed and not much of a drinker either ... once in awhile I’ll have a nice beer with dinner ... usually a stout or a sour You don't hang out with cool enough people . I get offered everything: pills, coke, acid, weed or ketamine even. Not even sucking any dick I swear!I feel this. I was Rock solid with $40k in the bank great job and career. Started on the opiates and years and 2 misdameanor charges later I can't get a job due to my background. Even with a 15+ yr career with an excellent professional track record. Those positions that will consider someone with a light record (generally smaller companies) won't hire me because I'm over qualified... Stuck between a fucking Rock and a hard place with no resources or options to generate income to break the cycle. Disheartening at times man but keep fighting.Honestly, the dare program made me realize what drugs were and since then I've been "HOLY WOW I WANNA TRY THAT TOO"Yeah, that's why I have to get mine through the mailhttps://i.imgur.com/dZGy6WD.jpgI’ve gotten free bags at sketchy gas stations waiting on my dope man. Closest I’ve ever gotten to that.Who is giving you free meth in the bathroom? Whut?> Would prescription oxycodone + prescription dexamphetamine = pharma speed ball??
> 
> (Have you done it? Was it any good? Is it actually dangerous, or just have a bad rep?)

Have done this many times. It's a great mix but just watch your doses, don't take more oxy than you would normally for your tolerance and you should be fine safety-wise. 

The actual mix itself is not where the danger comes from, the danger comes from the possibility of using more oxy than you can actually handle because the effect is being masked by the stim. Then the stim wears off, the opiate takes over, and you feel the full dose and possibly OD.

So keep your oxy dose at your usual rate and you should avoid this risk.

That said dex has about the same duration as oxy anyway assuming both are IR, so it's not as dangerous as a speedball with coke imo, since coke only lasts like 30 mins it's far easier to get into danger speedballing it.

But yeah for me I take dex in the morning to wake me up and as a super laxative haha. Then I used to take oxy on top when I used it. Was always a good time. But I made sure to never overdo the oxy.Not gonna say its safe but its not going to give you a heart attack. From what I understand they work on different systems of the body so they dont interact with each other besides the insane synergy. In my experience it was great and the opiate is perfect for when you start coming down from the amph type drugIn my home state we call adderal + oxy a suburban speedball Hahaha similar story. I was dating a girl who had a 70mg vyvanse prescription, and she said that every orgasm I gave her she would give me one. 

I think the record was over ten orgasms in a night. I wanted that vyvanse lmaoThis makes me sad bc I've done this before for percs back in the day.What is a butterface?"Try? First? Yeah, uh, whatever you say man, I'll take it."From the sidebar:

Psh.... Ya ain't gotta lie to kick it. At uni I always got given free drugs. One of my mates joked I was treated like a girl when it comes to drugs cuz of all the freebees haha. I even got free OC80's a few years ago. 

Nowadays not so much tho unless I get extras on a DNM order or like what happened today a pharmacy accidentally gave me 200 DHC instead of 100 lmao.

Oh I did get free tapentadol recently but that stuff is fucking shit.

>ketamine

Always a good one, mixes well with opiates too. One of my best drug experiences was oxy + ket. Probably not safe I know but can't say it wasn't fun.It sure is a fucked situation. I've dealt with the same shit. Even sayin you'll take lower pay doesn't work because normally they're using it as a cop out. I've even experienced ageism more than a few times. Apparently facial hair is a solid determinant of employee productivity. I get patronized til they know my age and then, " dude this, dude that, that's super " insert random youth slang on the recent side or one only used on MTV and FM radio POP stations"

I had people report unfriendly, unwelcoming, low energy, bad attitude, and stuff along those lines all in response to co workers interpreting my reactions as difficult/non team based personal projection.


Reality was I really had zero intuition what BAE stood for if it wasn't babe, and apparently I treated someone like " u left me on read and I had to be sipping tea trying not to go Cray without my curls"

 How isn't the normal response to the latter of that " what in the. Kind of Forrest gumping stupid ass morons are you? Did you eat slim joms for dinner and watch jerry Springer to make your family seem normal?

 What kind of 40 year old uses hundo pee dog ( hundred percent) to confirm they'll start your requests.....then he kept using " woke" " bad" and "eeeew barb must be on fiiii yah! Oh icedteas shirt would set the sprinklers off! Where's fire men when you need them? Woot woot.


You can ignore everything except I made him feel like he's Cray with no curls.

This stupid mother fucker doesn't understand earl grey is a popular British tea. It's not a,sayin. He must have kept hearing someone quickly say you got me sippin tea like I'm earl grey.

Well I told him who earl grey is and how dumb he sounds. Apparently I'm a grumpy homophobic white male. That had to be why I can't stand talkin to him. But if course, I was in the wrong.We're those freebies any good?Awesome, Thanks for taking the time to reply! =)

 -& actually explaining where the risk is helps, totally makes sense when you put it that way....

I have a super high tolerance to the oc (been on it for nearly 10 years, a combo of genetic disorder & serious MVA that destroyed my life- even on a 'high daily dose' I am still in constant severe pain.... I never have enough oc to actually get high from it, & I haven't used the dex recreationally since I was in highschool lol- so thanks for the education /harm reduction tips... (I could totally see myself as one of those newbs who just kept taking more oc because I'm so used to it, & haven't had the dex in well over a decade lol.... I will definitely keep that in mind when I go adventuring!! Thanks again =) ☆

Cool, thanks heaps for taking the time to reply, & share your experiences with the upper + downer combo �Hah, that has a nice alliterative sound to it =)Very coolMy manHow the fuck is this comment upvoted? People who make comments like yours are almost virgins. Come on dude...Also had a girl with a 70mg vyvanse Rx, shit kept me sane during IB tests I took during my senior year of high school. A chick with a hot body and an ugly face i.e. "I liked everything butterface (but her face)"r/butterface It is a stupid term that ugly ass men use that can't get a date any other way. Get a haircut, bitches.“I bet if you gave me 2 free lines I’ll get addicted and come back for more” My bad, I figured it was ambiguous enough. Edited. Huh, this is new. I've definitely posted city specific stuff in the past.A friend of mine got sent 600mg of not etizolam instead of 50mg of etiz. I don't know what the fuck it was, but he gave me a fucktone and I lost about 4 days of my life.

Sorry to hear about your severe pain though man.

Interestingly there's this woman I know who says her husband gets pain relief from amphetamine. So I gave her a few dex to share between them and sure enough she said it helps his pain. No idea how but found that curious.Kinda plays on the fact you might be picking both of those up from stay at home mothers in the burbs making a little extra cash lol Man, amphetamines are THE BEST for sex! Everyone knows that!! Unless, of course, they don't... �They didn’t even get it right. None of those girls even had nice bodies. That’s part of it. Everything but her face = butterface. And knowing is half the battle! Gotta love Dark Net shipping errors.

One time I got a gram of tar instead of .1 sample lol


Another time, I got sent 500 xanaxes instead of 50Yikes what if it was a fent-analog?You are right about some of that but conceiting to people who shape their world view based on misinformation, lies, fake news, and misinterpreted studies is a laZy cop out. If you're not willing to rationally lay out the undebatable facts into an argument that proves how incredibly uninformed they are, you are un worthy of living in the benefits of a society who embraces logic and critical thinking over misinformation, propaganda, and hate directed at substance users.

I do not accept alcohol as an acceptable societal intoxicant. Yet I would never infringe on anyone who safely indulges and doesny hurt anyone,with his use.

This is the only type of ethics that will fix the war on drugs. 
If you-
 ( always metaphorical 'you', not you tbone")
- do not believe in the legalization of drugs, you are bathed in propaganda.  Your sense of righteousness is decades behind and still influenced by conservative bible belt bullshit beliefs that never hold up to intelligent analysis.  These people still haven't separated their views, their self worth/ their morality from the church and conservative viewpoints.  If you as an adult cannot establish your own set of commandments to live by that most importantly doesn't effect anyone else negatively, than you shouldn't have a voice in any argument.

... me neither Sort by top man, some of those gals definitely have good bodies.I would be dead, but the supplier wasn't selling any opiods so it wasn't really possible. Pretty sure it was something like deschloroetizolam or some other weird analogue like that. We couldn't positively identify it, but it was pretty clearly a GABAergic drug.

Somehow understandingly regular RC suppliers and fent ones don't really mix. They're even banned from some onion market. So you don't just stumble into fent.No you are right it is not an excuse and I agree with most of what youre saying. I've just given up personally trying to change them. I would say 1 in a 100 people like that are ready for a change but Ive never had luck with people leaning too far to one side or another. People like that need a life changing event to push them out of their narrow point of view and even that isnt a given.Yeah I know it's usually pointless but maybe it's just what one of those fuck nuts needs to wake up and love their fellow human.
.sure does get tiresome tho.

That's why I sail heroin on the open waves of my badly lit heroin bath tub. Yes I feel you, drugs are the way I cope with it too. Only intellectuals get depressed my man we are in the minority.

Yes most stones marked cremation burials but over the centuries by the half way point of use burials stop being deposited, did they become purely astronomical calendars? Funerary enclosures for excarnation? And don't even tittle my wanker and bring up the wood circles. You wizardry brits, I wish I lived through your late Neolithic and early bronze age.

I wonder... I bet more people went gay for pay ro get heroin than they did for subs.All memes aside at least subutex allowed me to achieve 30 days sober on tuesday!This is awesome lol. All the suboxone memes and jokes r old and stale. Haven’t seen this one. Ever. Awesome. Haha I feel better now that I saw this Laughed out loud.Facts as fuck lol“The cure for the common junkie’Gold. Jerry it's gold! True true And to the traditionally sober folks, "recovery but it's gay". Suboxones just out there trying to help can't get any love. lol.sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn’t. fuckin’ way she goesI’m laughing so hard at this oh man it just made my day thank you OP love u����Lmfaohahahaha holy shit that's classic.Fucking classic���lmao..so accuratei don't think I even get it and I stil laughed my ass off[deleted]Subutex is much better. It's Buprenorphine minus the Naloxone which is what Suboxone is.Heroin but it’s gender fluidI don’t get this That was descriptive WordFuck the haters bro. 30 days without whatever you were taking is impressive even taking subs.  What the fuck do people expect, cold turkey from heroin?? Say word!  Congrats! Fuck the rest. I did 9 years on subs and been off and on 3g Kratom for nearly 18 months now. Keep killin. Subutex is a narcotic so you are not sober, you are just 30 days without heroin Happy to brighten your day :)LMAO yesDoes your bible say anything about getting drunk and playing VLTs there ray?

It's open to interpretation Julian yes.Right? Then you couldn't share needles and have gay sex.Really? Cause i have the option to take wither should i be doing subutexThanks man I appreciate it!Come on dude... I hate these arguments My bad didnt realize I was in an na meetingIf anything he is 30 days sober and currently on (semi-synthetic) opiates. Sobriety is a state of mind — stability, relative inner peace, etc. It’s so subjective that it’s useless and downright detrimental to claim ownership over a definition.Yes, a narcotic that helped me turn from a quasi-suicidal heroin addict into a person with goals. I was good at hiding my heroin habit,  but I do not have to hide the results of my suboxone use because it does not require that kind of work and deception. I’m dependent on buprenorphine but what difference would there be in my behavior if I was sober? 

If you have experience being on and off suboxone, I’d love to hear what difference you noticed.Buprenorphine is an opiateIt's still an opiate. Are you dense?Currently rewatching madmenAll I want to do is get high and mow lawns in the trailer park, and that’s okay. [deleted]Suboxone is Subutex+Naloxone. So hench the name SUB(Subutex)OXONE(Naloxone). Suboxone is safer but Subutex is a better...high I suppose. I don't fuck with it too much as I enjoy my H without any addiction. But my buddy got off the H and bangs Subutex all the time and loves it.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\* - The question of whether you should be doing Suboxone or Subutex is up to you. One's safer and the other is stronger. But both are relatively safe. So that's up to you and depends whether you're looking to get off someone or to get something from it.It is better than heroin don’t get me wrong, but if you think you’re sober while using this drug you are out of your mind Fuck meetings. But sorry the truth stings a bit.You could also argue being high is a state of mind and that I get high every day without using drugs. While this can be a true statement, it’s just hiding the other fact of the meaning of being high while under the influence of narcoticsNo, it’s not. He is 30 days heroin free while he uses a crutch to mask his sobriety and trick him into thinking he’s actually sober when in reality he is high everyday.I have plenty of experience with both. I will be 4 years clean from opiates this November. I used to think being on subs was sober, until I finally got out of that trap long enough to clear my head. You are still high while on suboxone. It is not an easy thing to do and almost impossible to imagine being in that state, but once you are clean long enough you will understand.It’s different than the opiates he was taking and if you don’t understand that or what I meant by the post then you are extremely denseey b0ssI’ve always personally believed that the naloxone doesn’t do anything it’s bioavailability is very low orally and bup has a much higher binding affinity than naloxone. > I don't fuck with it too much as I enjoy my H without any addiction.

That’s what literally all of us said about our drugs of choice too.  Spoiler alert: most people are just deluding themselves and have gotten addicted without realizing it.Suboxone is not safer, it's more dangerous since the naloxone can damage your liver and it's definitely not preventing overdoses.Nah, you’re just indoctrinated into an archaic idea of sobriety and recovery that hasn’t seen a revision since the Big Book first came out in ‘39. I’m gonna side with positive clinical results and general science.But it seems to have absolutely no psychological or physical effect other than the initial relief of sickness? That’s why I consider it sober, it seems to have no effect on my state of mind and I therefore do not co sided myself to be ‘using’. For me it has been amazing at stopping cravings and the constant thoughts about using. My life is totally back to normal now, yeah I have to take a mrs every day but it’s the same with my anti depressants. I am never high and my life is not the chaotic mess it was while using.Said the guy that runs na meetingsBullshit, if you are a true addict, on hard shit, Subs don't get you high. I wish they fucking did, but they don't. So, yes, that's absolutely clean time. They arent getting high off the shit, they are taking a prescribed medicine that keeps receptors full and keeps sickness and cravings at Bay, nothing more. If they aren't getting high, that's fucking clean time. You can take your bullshit idea of what you think truth is and shove it up your ass.I’m high on endorphins from my morning run (way stronger than any pill or H), does that mean I’m not sober?  I mean, I FEEL high. It feels good. Please, internet stranger, define my state of mind for me. Could you elaborate - I find the idea of being high every day at the moment weird, because I feel absolutely sober. How exactly would you describe your state of mind on subs and off them?You edited your comment. It originally said "clean from opiates", not "clean from heroin"
Anyhow, you're just being a douche to somebody in recovery by undermining their success. I thought I'd poke fun at your pisspoor wording.I'm talking mainly about shooting here Naloxone supposedly only becomes active if u shoot it. Since I break my doses up, I prefer Suboxone. The pills are hard to get broken in perfect doses. Plus it always seems to throw my tolerance off compared to the stripsYeah thanks dude I'm very moved by that little speech \*yawns intensely\* Naloxone isn't preventing overdoses?

&#x200B;No actually I’m just spitting facts, sorry if they are hard to handle. Not being honest is the greatest downfall of the opioid crisis. You are not sober until you are completely off everything.Right on! You only believe you are not high because that is what you are being told and you have nothing to compare it to. It has an incredible effect on your psyche. If this is ok for you then by all means continue to use. But don’t be tricked into thinking you are thinking clearly and soberly.If you think an endorphin high and an opiate high are similar you are a moronSuboxone is a narcotic it clouds your brain and judgement. While this seems like an incredible jump from the clouds heroin can cause in your brain- if you want to in fact be truly sober you have a long way to go to come out of that fog. Again, I couldn’t see it when I was using but once I came out of it I understood how detrimental subs actually were to my sobriety.I edited it because you were technically correct. Again undermining his success was not my intention but since its convenient for you that’s what you like to think. He should he congratulated and celebrated i, like you, was correcting his wording. Specifically the word “sober” if you were having a hard time figuring that out.Okay. Well if your taking them orally I think there both exactly the same. I thought you were saying ones always stronger than otherlol edgy. You can be in denial all you want but there’s no such this as just having fun with heroin.  

She’s not a lady you flirt with, by the time you think about leaving her, she owns your house and slashed your tires.You are a fucking lame and are in for a rude awakening. Clown shoes.Not in suboxone!So anyone who takes painkillers after surgery is a junkie and not sober?Only if we were all just honest about the definition of sobriety the opioid crisis would resolve itself lol You must be a believer in Jesus who thinks condoms are evil
Lol, no....just no. Chances are I’m far more educated than you. You’re a troll and just all around shitty person. Beta-endorphins can be up to 33 times stronger than morphine. And release of that endorphin results in pain relief and euphoria/sense of well being. Isn’t that why we all starting using opiates in the first place? The only thing missing compared to an opiate high is depressed cardiovascular function, which some people seem to enjoy for some reason. Same receptors activated. Exact same. 

https://i.imgur.com/KiIENqd.jpgI understand that, but I’m talking specifics - what specifically did you notice about your mental state on subs and then off them? Or are you just against medication for some other reason I had fun with heroin for about 3 months said I could quit any time then WDs kicked in and I said to myself, is it really that bad being a junkie? Then I went to fix.\*I can't do it so nobody can

Is that the jist of what you're saying? I use bi-weekly and go cold for 2 months every 3 months. I've never ever failed at it. I don't need some moralising asshole coming here being like "Uh did you know that Heroin is bad?"

Nooooooooooooo?!!!! Shut the fuck up dudeStick to the tramadol then buddy>A fucking lame

Good one You’re right actually! Which I assume is rare for you. The buprenorphine itself is preventing overdosed because of its high binding affinity and the blockade produced by that singular feature....if you are under the influence of pain killers then yes, you are certainly not sober. Not a junkie either...if this is a troll then good job...I understand the feeling may be similar you dumbdumb but one is a synthetic opiate and the other isn’t an opiate or synthetic at allEveryone’s mental state it different. It is the same as on heroin and off heroin, two vastly different mental states. For me the biggest was a numbing and high feeling suboxone was causing that I didn’t even realize until I sobered up. The same is for meth and off meth, cocaine and off cocaine. Again it is different for everyone and no I am not against medication. Again if you want to take subs to feel “normal” by all means do it. I am just pointing out the fact that although you may feel normal you are not sober, that’s all.Yea that’s what’s gonna happen to him too. He’s in denial but I don’t blame him. Who wants to admit they’re a junkie? I sure as fuck didn’t.I used pain pills for recreation off and on for probably 10 years legit before it became a problem. But it did. And every single thing I said wouldn't ever happen, got checked off one by one. Never do heroin, that's for junkies! Check, I'll try it instead of pills, but I'll just snort jt, I will never shoot up, that's the point of no return. Check, I'll just do a shot every so often as a treat for when I'm on a binge and snorting stops working as well. That lasted all of a couple weeks. This ignorant motherfucker has me legit triggered, talking this bullshit like he's special and untouchable. This shit WILL grab your bitch ass sooner or later, Randall. But just keep right on thinking you are fucking special and have more discipline and self control than the rest of us, homey. You're gonna find out the hard way.Ugh, I really wish I could see you face to face. I'd beat the fucking smugness right out of you, and that's not some bullshit internet tough guy talk, I'd do it and make you like it, chump.thequotes.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mark-Twain-Quote-18.jpgWhy is it rare for me, cunt?I dont think you understand how narcotic replacement therapy works... Let this man feel good about being off a horrible drug. Maybe your'e just jealous you could never do the same?

&#x200B;You don't understand what sober means. You think because you got clean then you and you alone get to decide what sober is. Sober means not intoxicated, drunk, high. You can take painkillers and not be high.

I recommended you stop thinking you are better than other people because they don't fit into your own definition of something.This is pretty much exactly me. I mean we were snorting OCs on the weekend and going back to school all week, no fiending, no withdrawals. Eventually you just cross a line and before you realize it your an addict. Your in WD and pills are drying up, somebody hands you a baggie and tells you "It's literally the same thing." >Relevant in any way? No. Going cold every 3 months just proves I have a handle on it. I'm not aiming to stop, the aim is to maintain the ability to stop when I want to. Which I still can. Run along moraliserMy goal is to help him and anyone who thinks being on suboxone is the same as being sober. I will be 4 years clean of dope this November. I used to think being on suboxone was clean but it’s actually harder to come off because the withdrawals are worse. Like I said he should be happy he’s off of heroin for 30 days. All I am saying is that as long as he is on suboxone, he is not sober.That is correct sober means not intoxicated, drunk, or high. If you are taking pain killers you are intoxicated. If you are taking suboxone, again, you are intoxicated. Don’t think I’m better than anyone I’m just trying to help the guy out because someone explained this to me and I too was stubborn like you. But I’m glad they told me because it saved my life so I’m hoping to save someone’s also.My mistake. Keep using your nice safe occasional heroin. You definitely have it under control, that’s never backfired for anyone I’m sad.

It wasn’t quite a guffaw, nor a snortle. But more than a chuckle, for sure. Oh my god - this guy is killing me.  My regular got picked up and his son is filling in.  Take yesterday.  Texted him at 8:30am.  He answers about an hour later and says 1:00.  But he *always* says 1:00 and he has a fit if you bug him.  So I wait til 4:00 to hit him up again.  He forgot, sorry, he'll be around at 9:00.  Text him 9:15.  Sorry, traffic, omw.  Again at 10:30.  I got you, I:ll be there.  11:45.  You mind if I see you in the morning?  
And this shit is typical
I've spent more time sick in the last 2 months over this than in the previous 2 years with this kid.
His father was so great, I foolishly let all my other contacts slip away and now their numbers are no good.  
Fuck me.
This iss pretty funnyCome thru, omwDon’t come yet. It’s hot over here right now. I’ll call you in 10 minutes. Mines the worst. Im leaving now... 20 min....10 min....pulling up. When he says pulling up hes actually leaving. Ive waited 8 hours for the dude before. Sometimes it's "7 minutes" though. Like... c'mon, just say 5 or 10 cause we both know it's gonna be at least 20+ anyway.I'm pulling up....I'm pulling up, I see you right now....

Sure you do bud...30 mins later..I'm pullin up rnim on my way nowMine today "got them percs, pull up"
Pulled up
"sold out"
SMH 20 minutes Felt like me today. It literally took my guy 9 hours to come through. 9 FUCKING HOURS!!!!Oh my God! This truly is a universal thing! “1min away”....half hour later. “Dude where are ya?!?
“1min papi”I figured out my dboy’s way of telling time so I always tell him I’m at the spot 15-20 mins before I actually am. Saves me a lot of waiting around“Can you just meet me at this place 40 minutes away or you can just wait for me. I’ll be there in 20 minutes” -Chef- Houston TX. Man imagine not even having a plug at all and having to rely on fucking middles.. fucking sucks, not even worth using.. That's the rocket payload [Cliff's alien parasitic bed bugs](https://redd.it/93cch1) hitched ride on.Always and never �LOL omg this is so funny!Here I comeFigs-in-ahh pull up rnHang on i'll be there in a secIt'll be quite the wait once the lawd comes to take them to the convalescent home in the sky :(Yup old people are the best plug. Just gotta hope he leaves his pills for me in his willOh man, this is scarily similar to what I've dealt with.

I need a drug dealer again.  It has been so long.Yo this shit bothers me! Like, this is your job, homie. This is the only thing you're doing to make money. Why do you gotta keep me waiting and pull these lines out your ass. They're obviously all lies. Just be upfront about it. I wish i could say this to my one dude, because he is exactly like that and I totally feel you. It's so annoying to have to deal with. Especially when you don't feel good.Kids these days ;-)I'm sorry. I've been there too much. Those are some long fucking nights...and some sweaty mornings...I could not deal with that level of bullshit. Sorry you have to go through that.I fucking hate this line. I always used to get this copping in an open market. "Yo its hot just walk around the block a couple times and come back"...like thats not more drawlin? Thank god I got a plug where I pick up now and its never "hotc so no waitingI fucking hate this line. I always used to get this copping in an open market. "Yo its hot just walk around the block a couple times and come back"...like thats not more drawlin? Thank god I got a plug where I pick up now and its never "hotc so no waiting8 hours? Fuck that has to be some sort of record. Lmao the classic "I see you right now!" Oh yeah! That's funny cause I don't see your or anyone else and haven't for the 30 minutes I've fuckin been here!!!!!

I don't miss those dope boys, not at fuckin all. Gladly, they’ve passed me onto their suppliers since im a very nice trustworthy and cool person with them, not just “another customer” im a very well groomed presented young male compared to the junkies that come( no offence to anyone) that are disrespectful; sketchy and non trustworthy The boys in kenso love that line. I’d be like bro, it’s always hot wtf are you talking about?I agreeeeee. Im so grateful I can just call my dude and not have to go to the block. Ugh.It was fucking brutal. If i need to meet him at 8pm, lets say. I'll tell him 5pm, that way when I actually am at the spot at 8pm, i only have to wait 30 minutes or so. Dudes ridiculous, but he's got the goods...soo it's bittersweet.NoiceKindness goes a long wayI feel ya, i’m always wicked polite to my plugs. Their always kind of taken back at first because their so used to cudi’s being mad disrespectful, coming up short on bills and only telling them when they pull up, please and thank you and etc...it’s weird saying thank you to your dude lol but they always appreciate it. I get hooked up more often then not, they don’t play games with me like they do to other people. They give me “white man time” instead of “spanish time” (their words not mine)

Like i said at first, their always taken back by it because usually everyones always rude to them so they gotta be a dick back...
I’ve had one old connect who took my kindness as weakness and didn’t realize the type of weight in hold with a lot of people around town...they lost a bunch of customers and had a nice and kind ass whooping � 
But idk the way i was raised i can be beyond polite when it’s not needed but it doesn’t take away from how i hold myself...some people believe it makes them look “weak” by being polite and shit but it’s really notI agree. Thats how i am with my dudes, too. They respond better to someone who is loyal and trustworthy than some of these other assholes I see. Haha near Allegheny too my dude. The only day I'll hear that line and not be mad is Thursday cause thatxs when they get the choppers out and walk the blocks and shitI hated going to the badlands and kenzo. Where I'm at in the midwest now my dudes come to the decent side of town and although I've sometimes got to waiy an hour, I prefer it to hitting the streets. I suppose it's nice to know it's there though.Jesus where the hell do you live that that's acceptable?Thank you sir Yeah especially in the drug scene. You know when you think about you need to be able to trust someone in a place you can’t trust anyone. It really does. I was raised with morals honesty and respect. I wish I could find a S/O like myself. I did have a beautiful wonder girl for a month I crushed on for months. Sadly she went back to her ex or 3 years:/ I appreciate every second I had with her. The best sex everI once lost a  back up dope dealer to this very thing. He had me waiting for no joke like an hour saying 5 away. While I was waiting my main more reliable dealer hit me back. Sure enough they both call saying they pulling up within like a minute of each other. So I had to tell my back up dude I’m good went somewhere else. He gave me this bullshit speech about loyalty and how I can’t hit him up anymore. I told him to fuck off cuz every time I called him it was the same hour wait for shittier dope.

Couldn’t believe the guy who literally bullshitted me every time for an hour or more, while lying saying he was close had the nerve to cut me off and give me an ethics speech.Yea forreal kensington is not my thang. Thankfully ive only ever had to cop there a few times. I feel like its gotten so much worse than before.[removed]Ehh you sound a tad arrogant tbh. Out of curiosity, what do ya do for a living?You appreciate every moment you had, best sex ever? You know how that sounds? 

I had lunch with my ex-girlfriend yesterday. I was with her for three years and I’m ashamed to say I never deserved like I had her. Don’t get me wrong, she was my best friend, I made sure to show her that I loved her however I could. It was so fucking hilarious how giddy she would get when I’d get her flowers out of the blue. I mean I did it because it made me happy too see her happy so it wasn’t selfless. 

But I’m just glad that we decided we’d never be gone from each other’s lives completely. I mean there’s still so much between us, when you know someone like that it never goes away. I’ll always love her, but I also shouldn’t try or hold out hope we might get back together. I did a lot of lying and would use drugs to the point that I didn’t realize how much I hurt her. Fuck it still just kills me inside to know who I was. On the converse, she’s the most gracious and loving person I’ve ever met. She knows it kills me and was able to forgive me unconditionally. She’s a beautiful person. 

You know I don’t come to this sub to choke back tears but damn. [removed]I’m sorry if I come off that way. I work at the Family Business and invest on the side Damn bro ;( sounds like you two had a genuine love for each other. Man oh man do I know how that feels :/ . I also made my ex aware of how much I loved her and would also do out of the blue cute things just the little things count youknow:/ Specific locations aren't allowed  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Must be 🔥, Content: , ups: 725, downs: 0Maybe it's heroin

Maybe it's fentanyl

Maybe it's maybellineFucked up but so, so trueAbsolutelyYup done this many times.Trueeee ( 2 chains voice )must be fentanyl...at least these days it seemsWhen I ODed it's cause my shit had fentanyl in it, which immediately changed my outlook on this logic Can I ask why? I’ll purposely go through a different plug if I hear shit like this(assuming it's not fentanyl)Can't relate.

I don't want fentanyl.I had to save my friend’s life the other day because we smoked a batch of H mixed with fent. His lips were blue, I gave him CPR. Luckily I didn’t have to press very hard on his chest. His involuntary muscles must have been working just enough because I could pump on his chest and he would take these shallow quick breaths when I would rapidly press on his chest. I would give him mouth to mouth and when I did he would take a really deep breath afterwords. I did this for an hour until he came to. I almost called the ambulance until i noticed that pressing on his chest caused him to breath enough to turn his lips back to a normal color. Now I just have it hidden and we are not touching it for a LONG time if ever again. Shit was terrifying. Fuck that, fent has fucked up the h market.. if it was raw h, I could see it, but in the u.s., if people are dying off a batch that just hit the streets, it’s not raw, it’s fent, or carfent.  
How I wish we could stop this fucking drug war. legalize, regulate, and tax drugs(h in this case), OD’s would go down 90+%.  We would be able to get a consistent, quality product that would be so much safer.  I’m highly confident that I will never see common sense drug laws, but what a dream it would be. 
Still not running to cop some killer fent, unless I was detoxing and that was all I could get.  Yall can have my share!! Lol[deleted]People actually want to stuff that makes people OD. That means it’s really good dope and they don’t need as much “Damn buddy must have some fire”I got a pretty high tolerance tho, shit prolly won't have me noddin. Those pussies just can't handle their dopecomments make me feel like I have the unpopular opinion of specificly seeking out fent. ���I literally got told thos today, that people have been dying off this batch.  I've always had a high tolerance to opiates though, even before I started using.  A blessing and a curse.NaturallyWell to those who are suicidal, then regardless of what happens,
It's all worthwhile right? Not saying if you have you are suicidal, just a food for thought joke. 
It's crazy the shit we do that can be clearly seen as stupid regardless to whatever extent though our minds are still capable of rationalizing us through it.Seriously guys what do I have to do to go cop some fent in a new city?maybe it's diacetylmorphine. Maybe she's born with itif people die it means its really good dope. i want real good dope. terrible logic but it is what it isThe same reason why we are opiate addicts I the first place... Lack of humility. We think it's not gonna happen to us.Then you are the judgmental guy screaming thru the window in the cartoon.Bruh get narcan, please talk to tracey she will send it to you.So glad you got them back! Fuck fent! If you are going to keep fucking around, get a thing of narcan!! You probably should of just called 911 and hide your stash. I know it sucks but when a friends life is on the line it’s not worth risking it Yep! I support you 100%. It is unfortunate that this will likely not happen during our lifetime.Lmao @ leachers like Kevin. Gets me mad cuz I’m like dude you have $8 stop being a fiend for 2 seconds and save that to live onusually just means its fent lol Lol @ this comment.Nice try FBIYellowpages Light yourself on fire and go to erFent is not really good though. I never liked it. I’m from the Midwest and will shun a dealer selling fyou mean its fentNo judgement. I have thrown shit out before that’s fenty, that’s just me thoughIt’s ok we are NEVER doing that again and there is narcan at my dad’s house. I might get him some but i don’t think he will do it ever again after that. I wish I had it when that happened. He was so fucking lucky. Who's tracy?I wont ever do that again. I felt good but my buddy almost died. There is narcan at my dads house. I’m never doing it again its just sitting in a deep dark corner of my art room and its never getting used ever again.I know but as I pumped on his chest his lips turned back to a normal color and every pump would cause him to make a shallow breath. Even if I did call an ambulance I would have had to keep doing that or I'm sure he would have died. I almost called but I realized that I was giving him enough oxygene and after 45 min. He came to.Junkies love fent Hahha gottem For real, account was made a week ago. Definitely a narcSame. Don’t like fent currently, yes, it’s probably fent. 10 years ago, it was just good dope(:The mod of the this sub, the mother of all dope addicts, the supreme sober sultan, the harm reduction pariah, the god, the one and only tracey helton. She was the focus of the 93 HBO doc about herion addicts. She got clean, she got degrees, she got jobs and she has spent the last 20 years doing everything she can to help addicts with clean works, narcan, aid, resources, you name it. She wrote a book, she does talks, she fights for addicts everyday. Cool, this shit is not worth death! Eh it’s pretty 50/50. Fent can get even the most seasoned addicted high as fuck but it doesn’t last long. It’s a personal preference get high as fuck on fent or stay well all day on dope. 

Personally I fucking hating not being able to go more than 3-4 hours without a bump of fent dope I couldn’t even get a full nights rest without needing a 3am bump. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOsQv-rrEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOsQv-rrEE)May I ask what the comparison is like compared to oxycodone? How would you describe the experience?[deleted]I did freestyle this piano song when I got home and was still fucked up https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/awe7ok/free_style_on_my_antique_baby_grand_piano_from/

It starts out slow but gets coolerDedDepends on what analogue you get, but it's usually a very short but powerful high. Oxy is way better, lasts long , is nice and euphoric, itchy. The fent I've had was itchy, whacked me like a train, but I needed to do a shot every like 15 to 30 mins.   Not something I would recommend if money isnt an issue, just get the oxy. It's not worth playing with your life like that  Like others said fent doesn’t have as much euphoria. 

Also fent sucks when you got a habit and your just trying to stay well. When heroin in my area turned into fent I couldn’t even sleep a full 8 hours without needing to redose What the other commenter said, but when I got fent pressed oxys it hit me 10 times harder without the euphoria. I was nodding the hardest I ever have in my life in the middle of my college class and the fent I had lasted around 6-8 hrs and came in waves I thought it was done after 2-3 hrs but came back in full force for another 3. It's not worth it. I could died cause I didn't know I was taking fent till a week after I finished themEntirely lacking in euphoria. Will nod you the fuck out though. 1999 documentary! I’m not THAT old ��‍♀️�Tbh this deserves silver.. If only i had silver to give you Yes what OP says here. The first time I did it, I thought i was getting real blues but luckily when i broke them up i could tell they were fake. I did a literal crumb of it and was whacked out of my mind. I never nod on fent, in fact I cant sleep at all on it (same thing happens sometimes on oxy for me too), but the high with fent is so short, have to re dose and its just not that same euphoric buzz oxy gives. Plus oxy lasts a lot longer. It really isn’t worth itYou will learn nothing while nodding in class.Luckily I had silver to giveSpent all the silver on the plug lolYeah I know it sucked  I normally don't nod with regular oxys. Unless I take a lot at homeYou just made my damn day. And you didnt even give it to me. HappyDay4MoneySo if someone gave me silver can I give it or something? How does that work? Or do I have to buy it? I got it once.  I didn’t see anything change It's just cool flair really, not like gold which is like "premium reddit" with no ads. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: This has probably been posted but I laughed out loud when I just read this., Content: , ups: 728, downs: 0Junkie love is a powerful thing haha Virgin abstinence vs Chad heroin addict I always get a good laugh out of the incels “chad the junkie” lol I love how he thinks he's a good person while assuming an entire subreddit of addicts are shit people lmfaoLol we are very charming I'll give us that.It really do be like that sometimes Yeah but Chad the junkie has drugs and you probably don't Yeah, because OP is probably not introspective in the least. I have a former friend like this. He was single for a long time and complained to me, saying "I don't get it. I have a nice house, I make good money, why am I still single?" Well, maybe because he treats women like objects, is a pathological liar and probably a sociopath, and thinks that all you need to "deserve" a relationship is a nice house and money. Material things. It’s weird seeing people actually buy j to this mindset lmaoBruh this made me laugh way to fuckin hard. That dude done had his girl took by one of us hahahaIts bc you're ugly dude Hey. Everyone needs love, even junkies, (im included in this category) except people who deserve to be forever alone. Fuck them man. 
It’s not even that difficult, you can be ugly as fuck and still get love, but the people who don’t get others are those people with shit fucking personalities or they’re major fucking assholes. It’s pretty simple, be a fucking good person and don’t suck and someone will find you attractive.Ah getting more pussy than some sad mother fucker! Chad over here will fuck all your girls for you! Twenty a pop turn off the lights and bam yo girl thinks you gotta dick from outa space.r/niceguysMr steal yo girl There's no such thing as Chad the Junkie. Chad is YOUR ALLS BOY. Dope dick ftwWhat makes this even funnier is that this guy obviously doesnt know what dope dick is and if he did he'd be even angrier. Chad the junkie is stealing your girl even while having a dick that only works half the time LOL love it.TIL I‘m a chadBeing bad is more fun. Girls know this better than guysThat sub is just r/incels with a less racism Fucking incels, drive me nuts. Like whining about never getting laid is going to get you fucking laid.


Oh, and yeah, we are addicts so we cannot be capable of love or being loved. The stupidity of some people blows my mind.The reason they don't have a girlfriend is exactly that attitude. I have seen my most down and out friend out on dates with the most beautiful girls, sheerly because he is a nice, caring person (despite his drug issues). Incels do my head in � I'm dead. That's absolutely fucking awesome. I like how he said "the girls you have crushes on" because he probably never even tried talking to them lolThat's too fucking good. Incels and "Nice Guys ™" are envious of addicts. I mean how fucking twisted in your head do you have to be in order to blame addicts for your lack of ability to get laid, or get into a relationship. 

The thing is these people give off that hateful, weird ass vibe that sounds alarm bells when you first meet/talk to them. You know that feeling when you meet someone and can just tell that something is not quite right in their head. All that hate filled vitriol that they spew online comes bleeding thru their personality in real world conversations, and the little voice in the back of your mind says get away from this psycho and don't give them your phone number. HahaChad has a bigger penis!2 hour opiate infused sex sessions..Because that dope dick don’t quit. A lot of us are functioning successful junkies, for now at least haha God I hate people who think like this. I don't care WHO IS moving in on your crush. The world isn't unfair. You just suck. Huh ... I'm literally (or have) all the above.  Pretty long-term monogamous, though.This some incel shit right here.lol, damn them incelsSo who breaks it to him that his girl is a junkie too. She’s not cheating with chad the junkie for his engaging conversation and rock hard cock lolwe got mad drugs and money what do u expect i thought girls just wanna have funHey I’m a slightly overweight unattractive guy hanging on to disability - and I still have an amazingly hot wife. It’s cause I’m nice and pay attention to her and treat her like a queen. 

I laugh at so called incels. It’s all self inflicted. They realize that ... their life will change. Idk I don’t find myself as a junkie I have a car, a job and I use multiple drugs as safely as possible and I also do as much research as I can before I try something U/ChadTheJunkie officially taken.Go over to forever alone and see how many whiny bitches there are that think there’s no correlation between their relationship status and their attitude lmao In our defense 95% of the time we can come up about $40 in a moments notice. That could be a cheap dinner for two or night out!Lol maybe if they stopped whining about how lonely they were and went out theyd run into someone EVENTUALLY, how pathetic, for christs sake Im lonely but at least I dont loathe in it and let it get in the way of seeking a relationshipAha hahaha. .....

I'd def rather a junkie Chad than an incel.... 

but I got lucky, I got a good boi who still loves me even though I'm broken af....I actually knew chad the junkie lol. Rip. Ahahahahahahahahahah incels are jealous of dope habits? Geez man go be the plug and see how many bunnies you have at your feet What a nasty ass fucking post. Fuck that dude, I hope his hateful ass doesn’t get any until he fucking mellows out.I don’t understand his ideology, how is it wrong for chad the junkie to fuck your crushes? Bro if you have a crush on a girl just stick to that. If chad the junkie was fucking your wife or gf then yeah I’d be mad too but your crushes? That’s whack Having big salary, big house blah blah.  If that's the sort of talk you use to impress girls then no wonder m8.  Think of what you think of a bloke when he starts going yeah I got this and that and a big house.  Maybe Chad the junkie has a personality  and they see past the drugs The weirdest thing is I get alot more girls now that I’m deep into addiction than I did when I wasn’t using. alot of girls tell me I’m mysterious(which I am bcuz I’m hiding my usage) and then they wanna help/fix me when they actually get to know me and I usually force them out of my life or ghost them after awhile bcuz I know I can only go so far in a relationship in the state I’m in. It’s weird when u want something it can be so hard to get it. But when u could care less about it you can’t get rid of it.  The ladies love us   because  they've  never been with a guy who dosent nut in 35 seconds  before and once they meet us they're  as addicted to us as we are to drugs lmao XDu/ryaasu lolThat subreddit must be an incel circle jerk, maybe spend less time complaining about opiate users and more time interacting with other people and they wouldn't be so hopelessly pathetic.Chad prob got a bigger one then you bro Dope dick > What a fucking loser hahaha
just pathetic, but nothing new from r/foreveraloneWhy do these guys just not get it. What???? You mean junkies are still people that are capable of love??? I am a junkie and I have been with my girlfriend for 13 years. She’s way out of my league. She’s gorgeous and i look like an island boy with a drug problem. We have two beautiful children together, and although I battle with opiate addiction, they know that I will die trying to make sure that all three of them have the best life possible.incelSup bros, I heard someone was talkin' about me? Imma go set them motherfuckers straight. Fer sure.LOLi havent gotten laid since i stopped getting high everyday.

girls rushed to me when i was nodding out though.

ive been with dudes girls before, cucked a dude once even, he slept on the couch while i fucked her. Why are these r/incels picking on us?  Love how he throws in "be a good person" as if being an addict somehow equates to being a bad person.Don't let this asshole tarnish /r/ForeverAlone. 99% of people there are good hearted people who have a rough time finding friends/an SO. FAers know they're the reason they're alone and that subreddit is an awesome community. /r/Incels is the shitshow and that asshole belongs there.Should have woke up Janelmao belee dat I stayed fucking niggas bitches when I was getting high. Now that I'm sober- well some things never change :) Gosh. I’m sorry. There is no ivory tower here at all. I don’t understand you guys downing me. =[This is true though. Being an addict who is clean for quite some time now can agree that junkies tend to get some of the baddest bitches in the world! U know the the whole "girls love bad guys" well it is all about power and control. The girl chooses a hard case, felon, drug addict,etc and you're scratching your head like, WTF??! SO HERE IT IS BROKEN DOWN , WOMAN LIKE TO CONTROL AND EMPOWERED THEMSELVES, MUCH LIKE MEN BUT WITH THE FEMALE THEY THINK THIS "BAD BOY" THEY CHOOSE THEY CAN SOMEHOW HELP AND CHANGE THEM AND THAT ONCE THEY CAN DO THIS THEY HAVE THE GUY THE WAY THEY "WANT". Unbeknownst to said female, drug addicts only change when they wanna, girl or no girl. See drugs come before everything...sex,food,etc...so woman are powerless. P s. Sorry 4 all caps earlier**The Virgin** -

Pls someone make a real good one Chad the heroin addict, what are the odds. I love you so much for this comment Stuck in his box. If only there were some kind of eye-opening experience to resolve this kind of mindset...Haha.  I would pay money to see you try to explain this concept to him.   I guarantee he couldn't wrap his mind around it. Incels don't get how offputting their negativity is. You can be a rich, good looking dude, but if all you do is complain all the time no one is going to fuck you. Yeah and drug addiction is one indicator of anti social personality disorder. Even with superficial charm we do better than incels I guess..

Edit: anti social personality disorder is what I meant, damn phone...:)They don't think it be like it is but it do.You sound like a moron.Nailed it!

Literally tooI know someone like this as well--it is as if he expects a significant other to show up like his Amazon boxes do. No, dude, you have to seek someone out and develop a relationship. It takes time and work, and one is not just automatically 'issued' one because you have a good job and a house... It blows my mind that this would actually have to be explained to *anyone*I agree. And you know we slept at her place, ate her food and borrowed her money as long as she would let us get away with it. Lmao. Ugly on the inside, where it really matters. /femaleAnd test clean of Hep, HIV, etc.  Can confirm. Ugly as fuck and I still have love. And she's wayy out of my league. Why? I bathe in a thousand gallons of charisma a day.Ehhh, social anxiety can fuck with that.lmao /r/braincelsMr steal yo *anything*

Junkies..am I right?mista fuck yo bitchall these rappers talkin ab gettin head off lean U know they arent rly sippinIt definitely is more fun, depending on where you're from. Small, rural living conditions always result in more hard drug use in younger populations. That's why certain people gravitate towards those in that lifestyle. I mean, until they get knocked up and have two kids before graduating high school. At least that was the case in the small Ohio town I lived in for a while.It's crazy that there is someone envious of us. I've never had any problems in the female department but I have a fucking crippling addiction that controls my every waking moment and even haunts my dreams. I could go to a bar or get on tinder and find a chick to hook up with but the love of my life died of an overdose in bed next to me and since then I've been way less interested in relationships. Also I'm trying to stay clean for the first time in forever so most of my day is filled with the thought "I'd sure love to do a shot". I'm pretty fucking miserable and that's a step up from recently when I was entirely fucking miserable and these dudes are stupid enough to envy us bc we can hook up with females. Smh My dope dick would like a word with you, please.*knocks on wood*I mean the world is pretty unfair, to be fair. How else do you explain parts of Africa or the Middle East? Being born there is kinda unlucky and kinda unfair The world is super fucking unfairThe world definitely isn't fair, otherwise I could smoke weed in peace, without having to be considered a criminal. Also it's not fair how good opiates make me feel, and then with drawl, that shit sucks. So you’re Chad the Junkie *with* the 6-figure income, nice car, & big house?

Lucky you, able to weigh in with the likes of ppl on this sub!Howwww...? I feel like I'll stay single forever bc even tho I'm a reasonably attractive and employed girl with a stable income I just can't imagine a scenario in which a good guy would wanna spend any time with my dysfunctional dope slamming ass. Also I wouldn't wanna deceive anyone but bringing up addiction on the first date ain't it either. You're....not a junkie. You just sound like someone that parties. That's a good thing man. Dont do dope and you'll never have to be one.

If you're homeless and spend all morning dope sick flying a sign at a highway off ramp to score so you can get well...you're a junkie. Or pawn all your family heirlooms to buy dope. 

Or lie constantly to everyone that loves you. 

Or dont have any veins left in your arms that will register so you've resorted to shooting in more *creative* places.

I'm a junkie and it's not a good time...

That power only works if the 40$ is for dope though..They’re pathetic babies what do you expect? ...That doesn't work 60% of the time. *Sweet*. 

jesus christ I just browsed that forum and for however miserable they are they should've become one of us alreadyOmfg I died at "Chaddict" DaturaI technically am “involuntary celibate” but when you literally start calling yourself an Incel it’s game over, you’re never fucking You literally summed up their problem lol. I think people can tell on a subconscious level as well.[deleted]That's what I don't get about Elliot Rodger. Dude was relatively handsome and drove a BMW. Lived in Santa Barbara where there are tons of girls. If he just put the tiniest amount of effort in..
?? Anti personality disorder??And here come the wanna be edgy "socipaths". For real though, most addicts are just looking for an escape, however momentary it might be. [deleted]It's a meme brother.Nickelback sounding headassYeah well you sound like Nickelback.

JackassYeah well you sound like Nickelback.

Jerk.Exactly. I feel like we're talking about the same person. It scares me that this mindset is common place. Just because he's got a few things in his life in order he imagines a relationship to just show up--I love your Amazon analogy, that's perfect. Never mind that he treats women as sex objects and annoyances otherwise and takes great pleasure in weaving elaborate lies to make himself look good. 

I once was sat right next to him while we were smoking and watching TV. A girl he was dating texted him and asked him what he was doing later that night. He laughed and said "watch this." He read aloud his text to her as he typed it out -- he told her his grandmother had fallen ill and as much as he'd love to take this girl out as they'd apparently planned, he was his grandmother's favorite and needed to be by her side as she might not have long to live. He laughed and told me his grandmother was fine at home. 

And yet he wonders why he's unwed with zero actual prospects. It blows my mind. Woah! High standards much??? What’s it like looking down on the rest of us from your ivory tower? �nahhh share the love broHep really doesn't matter in that situation. I agree. I am OK, and things work out. And BPD makes that a little difficult alsoThis comment is gold lmao 

P.s. it's not real gold so nobody try and pawn it!! Hahaha �If I had gold I would give it to youHaha for real! 

"Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more"

Shut up Rick Ross how you fucking more by taking more opiates haha.These type of people are beyond help lol. They blame everything on either "slutty women" or the "mysterious Chad" instead of reflecting on the common denominator here which is themselves. 

I've noticed that they all have horrendous personalities which anyone they interact with notices, which results in them not getting laid, which results in them becoming more hateful. It's a vicious, hate filled cycle they stick themselves in. 

And they keep this cycle going because it's easier to bitch about and hate women and other men than to actually change how they think, and interact with people. 

With all that said I'm sorry to hear about your loved one passing away. And if you've already kicked the habit and got through detoxing you really need to keep fighting the urge to shoot up bro. I know I'm just some random message on the internet but if you ever need someone to talk to that can somewhat related to what your going through don't hesitate to hit me up at any time. 

I hope life goes well for you bro and at least one guy on Reddit is rooting for you. Have a good one!Take it from someone that grew up in a thirld world country, it's generally not as bad as most people are lead to believe by those infomercials play "in the arms of an angel" showing starving kids and rampent death. Don't get me wrong, great suffering exists, but day to day people are pretty much the same as anywhere else(barring cultural differences and whatnot). 


As a side-note, I've noticed that despite worse living conditions, people in poorer countries can lead a happy overall life hugely as a result of the community based cultures which are kind of natural product of economic poverty. People generally look after each other and their struggles bring them closer together. Still not something to envy, because the reality isn't that great in the end, but it's not all doom and gloom  :)[deleted]yea with drawl sucks- but have you ever been without drawl? For the next twenty minutes, anyway.  Or I'm a troll, whatever.Honestly, I think that if you’re authentic, painfully honest, and confident about your lifestyle you can find a good guy.  I just got into a new relationship 5 months or so ago and I told he guy right off the bat.  

I roughly said: ‘Hey, I’m a heroin addict who has been involved in all sorts of less than legal schemes.  I’m trying to get clean but I relapse sometimes.  It’s been quite the journey but it made me who I am and I don’t regret a second of it.  It’s allowed me to find strength in myself that I never knew I had.  Anyways, if that doesn’t scare you off, I’d like to take you out.  We can see where things go.  I promise you right here and now that I’ll never lie to you, you can decide later if you can do the same.  For now, I just want to take you on a long walk around my city & maybe grab a bite.  You in?’  

We’ve been together for 5+ months now.  I think things were made easier by the fact that I’m trying to stay sober, but I’ve done this in the past when I was still using & it still worked well.  My #1 rule is that I NEVER lie to my partner.  If for some reason I lie or manipulate them, I call them right back and explain why I lied and what part of what was said was a lie.  Most men I’ve been with didn’t believe that I was that honest with them until they heard me apologize for a small lie they didn’t realize I had slipped out.  Another big thing is that I try not to use directly in front of a guy until I know he can handle it - I go to the bathroom or something.  He knows what I’m doing, but unless he asked to see it, I’ll keep it out of view.  This also keeps me from being asked by someone who doesn’t use to try H which is so not my idea of ok.  I’ve introduced one friend to h and another to pills ages ago & I don’t want to go there again.

Anyways, good luck!  As long as you are open & honest, (about feelings as well as facts about your life), you’ll find someone who cares for you.  Ignore the username, I'm a male.  I made the username for a troll post.

But I'm gay -- I'm pretty familiar with men.  They might not want a complete junkie mess, but if your circumstances are such that you can keep in your shit together and not spend most days alternating between wasted and too sick to get out of bed, there are lots of (pretty successful) guys that won't mind you.  It's not the drug use that bothers anyone, it's all the associated antisocial behavior.  Can you control that?

I never hid the fact that I'm a junkie, not even close to 100% functional (I mean, I am pretty miserable a couple days a month and just kill time - like now - waiting .. ) and my partner's a doctor who doesn't touch anything stronger than weed or alcohol.  I never hid anything from him, we were friends for years first.  But I guess I made a pretty good effort all the time to not be a stereotype.  I think if he'd been further advanced in his career at the time and dealt with more junkies like he does all the time now, he might not have taken a chance on me, though.You just haven't met the right one, Im a good looking guy, have a good job, and all that as well. Hell I'll be honest and say I to am a "dysfunctional dope slamming" type of person and probably always will be. But that doesn't hold me back, I continue to push forward, try to find the positive in every thing that comes my way, work my ass off everyday, and mainly I put myself out there and I make sure I'm in a situation that I'm going to get the opportunity to meet new people, not just fellow "slammers" either. A person can never have too many friends so even if I don't find someone I'm interested in like that, I'm still walking away with a few new friends regardless. Just hold your head high and be proud of yourself, and trust me there's plenty of guys out there that would love to spend time with your "dysfunctional dope slamming ass", I assure you of that.So heres my thoughts on it- take it or leave it. I've been in several using relationships and also relationships with other addicts when we are both clean, and a single relationship with a "normy". 

I don't think anyone who is actively using is fit for a relationship in any sense because quite simply you don't have the capacity to fully care for another person. You have one need that must always be met and will always come first- no matter what. 

I don't think a good guy would be making a good decision in spending time with an actively using heroin addict to be honest- same with a girl getting with a guy who is using. They deserve better and hopefully they know it. When I was using I ONLY attracted unhealthy females.Meet guys who are in a similar position.

The somewhat painful truth is that if you are an addict and/or mentally ill etc, most "normal" people will probably not like that.

But the world is full of people who have their own problems and will be understanding towards yours, whether they're addicts themselves or have different issues of their own.

My ex's always broke up with me because once they got to know me they didn't like what they saw. But I've been with my current gf for years because she has her own issues and we understand each other and to an extent even help each other. That is key.

It's like I'm a broken person but she helps me feel more complete. You gotta find that.I guess I’m not a junkie then just a kid that likes to get high, sending prayers for u
-this message took me 5 minutes to write im too high of MCreative places? Example? Angel's trumpetUh...no? No poison.my biggest secret to them is this little trick I found online. No matter how desperate you are,theres always a fat chick more desperate willing to bang you. lower dem standards boiiizI was too for a while, and had to use all the strength I had to not let it affect me. Luckily
It worked out because I was able to mask it, but when people make that their identities it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. "I demand a 9/10 fit girlfriend, but I shouldn't be expected to get in shape or make myself more attractive or sociable at all".Please tell me what the f is an “Incel”!?Elliot Rodger said himself in his videos he was too scared to even talk to women. Apparently this means they're the ones at fault, not him. Makes no sense. And he was scripted Xanax too I dunno how you can be unable to chat to girls on Xanax I can't stop chatting up girls on benzos.Anti social personality disorder, they mean. Which doesn’t have to do with being introverted or shy, the way it’s usually used in casual conversation. It refers to being “anti society” and is characterized by lying, manipulation, superficial charm, and usually substance abuse and violence. Extreme cases of anti social personality disorder are often referred to as sociopathy or psychopathy but that doesn’t mean anyone with anti social traits is a sociopath. I was told I exhibited anti social traits when first getting sober/admitted to rehab but they usually tend to diminish with clean time.I think it falls close to a criminal psychopath in psychology. Anti personality disorder is essentially being a psychopath who doesnt commit crimes.Sorry I totally meant anti social personality disorder. It's the umbrella that sociopathy and narcissim fall under. One of the signs is substance abuse disorder. It's listed as a symptom in the DSM 5... Use the Google, not everyone is "trying to be edgy". Well don't be stingy, share the damn meme!We must look like ants from all the way up there.share the love, not the needleThank you. Metro church girl is not working out bruhYup... story of my life.Not to mention autism spectrum disorder...Lmao, thanks man. I'll take your junkie gold cos I know none of you broke mfs would pay for the real thing. 

....but..for real. You got any gold? My moms sick. And..I have kids.��Hey man, we all wish we had some gold. It's the thought that counts ;) thanks.[removed]Travel to a few poorer countries in Africa and talk to some locals to get a good idea of what their life is like. I'm not saying this in a condescending tone; I genuinely think that you would personally benefit from such an experience. The perspective you gain will expand your entire world view and maybe even shift the way in which you think in general. I have a hard time believing that someone whose username is XXhornykitty could be a troll Thanks, that's so obviously the right thing to do but so so hard... Time to stop complaining and start putting myself out there lol. Super glad you have a good relationship btw. Also, you sound like a pretty brave and honest person. Thanks fr. Maybe I don't trust people enough, but I'm afraid someone might not look beyond me being an addict. But I'm far from a mess. Self sustaining and if you didn't know you wouldn't guess I was using. Thanks for the reply, man. I guess I have to take the risk to get rejected and just start meeting people.


Edit: that didn't sound right. I sure am a mess in many ways but not an obvious one. That is the perfect way to put it. My partner has smoked weed like two times and is an awesome person but I never lied to them. Probably because I am too lazy to do all that. I would much rather be like hey drop me off here and drive around the block lol!

I think if we are honest and don’t make our habit a burden on everyone else, a lot more people will understand than we think.

That’s what hilarious about Mr. Incel...he can’t get that if you’re obsessed with your needs, your entitlement issues, and blame everything on everyone else, then people will figure out pretty quickly they can’t deal with you, regardless of your job or drugs or whatever.

It’s like they’re jealous because they are sociopaths without even superficial charm lol!

Edit:wordI was a kid that likes to get high too. We grow up to be junkies if we're not careful. That's all I'm saying.  Be safe famLol...weirdest was probably in my inner thigh uncomfortably close to my vag. Oh and..in the side of my fucking thumb...that was awful *but it worked.*.There's a fine line between death and deliriantTrue? When I was super junked out I turned down a lot of sex from chicks ranging from ok to fucking smoking hot bc all I cared about was getting high and I knew I wouldn't be able to get off even if I tried for like 12 hours. It would just frustrate me. The incels would reee so hard knowing that while they're crying themselves to sleep with their anime body pillows theres ppl casually turning down pussy for drugs.Honestly, if not being able to get laid consumes your entire life you clearly have bigger problems 

These people just blame women for not wanting to fuck 300 pound neckbeards[deleted]a sociopath is the word you're looking forNarcissistic personality disorder is a separate diagnosis from anti-social personality disorder. They share similar symptoms though.Yea, it's comorbid, but I'm preeeeettty sure that most addicts aren't pre-dominantley full blown sociopaths. Maybe an addict will behave like someone with ASPD while using, BUT that isn't necessarily an indicator of who they normally are.Might just be the withdrawals lmaoI wish I could give you gold for that commentI just need to put in work. That's all. Dunno why OC got so highly upvoted, there is just too many exceptions where it isn't even our fault.And they all are sick... cough cough Can you please edit the part about who you live with? This breaks our meetup rule. Lmk when you edit. dude it was not serious, but if it made me healthy i would move to any place in africa, trust me (yea, even somalia) i cannot even fucking work so i cannot buy nice things

maybe if you lived a day like me it would also give you a new perspective and if you are also ill then i am sorry, also deleted the comment because i dont want anyone to be upset about it, it was not seriousThe account was created for a troll post, for sure.  Which was quickly deleted, spoiling an hour's carefully-crafted hilarity (or so I thought).

I'm too lazy to make a new account for now.Yep.

Although on reflection I might have been a little too sanguine: I don't want to pretend that the knowledge that their loved one is an addict isn't a burden, even if you manage to keep your problems wholly to yourselves, which, admittedly, most aren't capable of.  My partner is very familiar with me (10+ years) and knows I'm not going to overdose or anything and once in a while he still has these despairing monologues about helping me quit, not knowing the magic words to say to help me, etc.  But aside from that, and aside from the occasions where maybe I've had to force myself to be pleasant company when I wanted to just lie in bed moaning, I've kept the chaos and ugliness away from my family.

My partner and I talk a lot, and I don't think we've so much as mentioned or hinted about drugs for weeks now -- so it's a pretty small issue in our life.  This is unlike the vast majority of addicts.  But if you've got a stable income + stable access + a long-term user with a regular dosing schedule who won't be tempted to blow the mortgage on a few extra shots, it's possible.  It's always good to have a methadone script for emergencies of course, or as a bit of a base.  I don't know if you've ever tried methadone, but contrary to what people might think, it binds to the same receptors as morphine but for a longer time and without  the same rush.  After the first 20 minutes it feels identical to heroin IMHO.

P.S.

People often describe sociopaths as having "superficial charm", but I dunno, to me they seem sleazy and transparent as fuck.  I've certainly met a lot of them and don't fall for it anymore, I've become immune to sob stories.  What I've noticed though is that if there's a guy and a girl hearing the sociopath's patter, the girl is way more likely to find it charming, and the guy will just think he's a creep.Thank you for your advice brother, hope everything is well for you :) ❤️This sounds... profound. It really do be like thatit do be like that sometimes doe Bruh it really do be like that. I always bust my nut tho. After years of injecting large amounts of heroin oxymorphone and having sex from 5pm til 945am the next day eventually you start to be able to get one out after about an hour 2 if your not really trying. Makes for one food fuck session tho. Nice and long both parties leave satisfied. When I introduced speed into the mix is when it got exciting for me again. I was the same turning down sex left and right I think I went almost a year without a single fuck at the height of my addiction. My girl almost left me because I just was to occupied getting high and it wasn't even all that pleasant. It made her feel unloved and really sad. She offered me 3 ways with her friends that were so fucking hot not to mention honegirls or coworkers who all wanted me back then. Od give anything to have that kinda pussy thrown ar me like that again at current time �I actually think a majority of them are scrawny kids with acne and no social skills, which are all “fixable” for the most part. Never thought I’d be discussing the incel problem on /r/opiates, but here we are.as someone who used to be fatso, this! obesity is disgustingAhhh, I see. Thank you, Champion. found Shanewhy thank youEdited. Sorry about that.I'm a sister ;) but no problem. I dont want to see someone make the same mistakes I did.It got to the point where if anyone wanted to chill with me they had to have dope or be willing to get me dope and ppl actually did it. Super sad and I feel bad about it. 

"Hey lobster my friend who was over yesterday said you're really hot and she wants to fuck you" -friend

"Does she have dope?"-me

"I'll tell her to get some."-friend

Word for word how an encounter went down earlier this year. Getting sober is making me look back and realize how fucked up I was.lol i found this the few times in life ive had gfs. Pussy only comes your way easily when it knows you cant accept it.Yessss remember that guy Elliot Rodger(sp)? He was an incel and  murdered some girls in cali and killed himself (i think that's what happened.) He has some videos on youtube blaming women for him being a virgin and how attractive and rich he was but "bafoons" were getting all the girls. He was scrawny and had acne lol. Facts.. at least now my sex life is daily and amazing. Still sad to think back on all the lost times my girl literally wanted to have nasty af 3 ways or just watch me skull fuck her amazing hot friends. Everyone was down but me apparently and everytime they would make attempts it just went right over my head. I would just be confused as fuck wondering why the 2 almost naked females way out if my league were pissed at me. Now I just get to look at em and basically beg for a second chance and I get told I'm not man enough. Ego deflated like no other... at least my girl is way too hot for me now that I'm not soley focused on my fix and hitting an actual vein. Fml Rodgers is a bad example — he was actually reasonably attractive. Unfortunately for him, he was also a fucking sociopathic creep. Contrary to what incels think, looks aren’t everything.Ptoof that it's not their looks. It's their creepy attitude. Very true.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Buying H in NYC for the First Time, a Retrospective [long as fuck], Content: I was ordering the dried pods of the poppy flower and dosing myself with the narcotic opiate tea made from these pods a couple of times every month -- in the last years of high school -- then college -- then the years following school when I was directionless and sad, bouncing from one city to another in search of something I could not name.  My Paypal history with my preferred pod vendor is the most accurate record of everywhere I've lived -- old apartments and zip codes -- cities and towns I've passed through quickly and forgotten.  I've tried almost every opiate under the sun, and   have never been physically addicted or gotten into trouble because of them.

Anyhow, if you are into pods, you know what happened to them.  My last order of pods, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and take a trip to NYC to buy heroin.  I bought a bus ticket online, and made arrangements to stay with a friend for a few days.  The ride is a couple of hours from where I live.  I wrote down the address of a needle exchange, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, but my timidity when it comes to asking the “right people”, my clean-cut appearance, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, it was still early afternoon.  My friend was working until later, so I decided to walk around Manhattan and see if any opportunities would present themselves.  The first person I came upon was begging for change at a street-light.  When the light went red, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously, if she knew “where the dope spot was at.”

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, that she's in a methadone program now.  She seemed suspicious. Methadone is a subject I'm interested in, and we got to talking.  We discussed the length of the methadone detox, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, even with her suspicions, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks, it was too much to resist.

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, a rocket ready to fire into space.  “Alright.  Let's go.”  I was tagging along beside her, trying to keep up.  We jay-walked.  We jay-walked again.  A car honked.  A hot-dog vendor yelled.  My heart was pounding at the prospect that I might have actually started the chain of events that would lead to having heroin in my pocket.  She checked every machine we passed by with a change-slot:  pay-phones, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, it seems, has a brand name.  The bags were about the size of postage stamps.  I quickly stuffed it in my pocket, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed, happy.

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, restaurants, and cafés.  I presented a clean-cut appearance and almost always patronized the business whose bathrooms I used to avoid suspicion.  I carried a cup emblazoned with the place's logo, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, Tracie asked me if I booted. I said yes, and she offered me a “clean spike.”  I remembered what “boot” means, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, even though I know I'm missing out on the “rush” that come with injecting heroin.  A tall black guy walks past us with ear-buds in.  She discreetly pointed at him and whispered “he raped me”.  “He knew I had two warrants out and so I couldn't call the cops.”  “That's fucked up” was all I could think to say.  “My program, if they see me doing any deals or anything, I'm totally fucked.”  She threw the two tiny wax paper bags, into a baseball cap that has suddenly materialized in her hands.  

In the bathroom, I would unzip my backpack and take out a literary journal I purchased before leaving, not realizing that I would be too high to read any of it.  On it, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, and toss it out.  I would take the straw and scrape off any heroin that might have inadvertently gotten stuck on the credit card during while I made the line, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal, just to make sure I got everything.  I would lick my finger and rub it on the back of the journal.  If I saw more than a little bit of powder, I would feel sad for wasting good heroin. I would taste my finger.  It always tasted great.

Before I came to New York, I had scoured the internet in search of Fun Parties and Events and anything that might be interesting.  A Food-Lovers Group was organizing a “guacamole tour” – there were shows and concerts.  I never did anything on the list, my afternoons and evenings all surrendered to a series of heavenly nods.  

The third and final time I saw Tracie, her girl wasn't picking up her phone.  We walked around to kill time, calling often and getting antsy.  We went to a Starbucks, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, we ran into one of her friends, a handsome boyish looking middle-eastern kid about my age.  He had a Sbarro bag with him, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, and that I should not worry.  He loops around a corner.  We follow him, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags, tucked between his thumb and index finger.  He walks away immediately.  I put them in my pocket.  We dart off.  “You owe me two” Tracie said.  I tell her I know.  I counted the five bags and put two in Tracie's outstretched hands.  

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, while she uses the women's.  I declined.  She asked “Am I going to see you again? I figured you got three this time, you know, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.
, ups: 723, downs: 0Thank you for writing this. You painted an excellent picture of yourself and Tracie. You created tremendous sympathy for her. You let the story unfold at an unrushed pace. There are natural emotions shown simply. Whether or not you meant it to be, the coffee is a fantastic allegory, as are the fingernails.

A long time ago I worked as a first reader, and later as an editor. If I saw this submitted as a short story, I would recommend it for publishing without hesitation. Find a publication, and submit it. They're not cheap, but pick up a Writer's Guide, or see if there's one at a library you can use.

This story is worth money. I suspect that you could write more that are worth money. If you're worried about it being traced to you personally, tell that to the publisher when you submit. They'll know what to do.

Remember to only submit to one publication at a time. Wait until you get a letter back before submitting to another. Don't let rejection letters get you down. Every good writer gets them. The only people who never get them are people who never submit.

Good luck.I love this story. You have skill in writing, please don't waste it. This story made me excited thinking about my past but also very nervous for your future.That was easy to read for looking so long. Good story.TIL :  there are still working pay phones in Manhattan*Heart Warming Tales of the Doper*


Edit: Also, your writing is very enjoyable to read. You should try to make some money with it, if you dont already.I always think it's funny when people say a post is long as fuck and it's like a paragraph.  But this one IS long as fuck!  Loved it though, you're a great writer.  Glad you accomplished your mission, but stay safe!This just got [depthhubted](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/w3pku/thatsweetembrace_buys_heroin_in_nyc/). Great writing. I hope you do something with those writing skills!The path starts wide, and narrows to razor wire.

You usually don't notice until you start to fall. 

Live your life the way you want to, but be aware of what choices you make. You sound so much like me that it's uncanny. I'm sure most people here can identify with your search, however, and how we all at one point or another, find ourselves in an unfamiliar place, and need to find a way to score.

Good on you for taking care of the people that took care of you, and man - I so know the feeling of scoring through shady characters. I, too, have that clean-cut appearance... so much so that I always get accused of being a cop. I hate that... almost as much as I despise cops.

Anyway, I enjoyed your story, and the others here are right - you do write very well, and I'd love to hear more of your tails, from your pen, through your eyes.

Stay safe brother! :)Beware the tale of redditor SpontaneousH.

Casual pot smoker with a family, a job, and happiness. 

He documented his downfall by telling reddit he would only do heroin once. How tragically wrong he was...

He became a habitual user and lost everything, his sanity packed up and left him too.

Don't fuck with this poison

At your discretion- http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ke63/i_did_heroin_yesterday_i_am_not_a_drug_user_and/Very well written, even if it was complete fiction, you had me glued to the screen. I agree, you have a talnet, dont let dope fuck you up like so many of us.yep...i did that for 5 yrs and it swallowed me whole....like a whale....

i lostSounds like the fangs are in deep. good read. If you ever write a novel, please come back and tell us. That's the most enjoyable piece of writing I've read in quite a while. Get help. Seriously, get help. You have a talent for writing, use it.Great story man. Makes me appreciate having like 10 dope connects in my phone, and a whole city full of others just a 15 minute drive away. I can't drive through the city for 10 minutes without having people bombarding my car with bags. I don't think there was ever a time in my 6 year heroin career that I haven't been able to cop. I'd go crazy if I had to go through all those hoops just to score, but if I had to I would do it without any hesitation.I have gotten some of the best heroin I ever did from a homeless dude in NYC. I live here and could never quite get the same quality again. I love the detail!  It's also good to know that I'm not the only shy, non-street guy out there in this particular world.  [deleted]10/10 would read againyou should write more about your experiencesYou can make money off writing dude. Good story. Nice read man.I wish there where more post like this. Great read and great writinggood shit!That was great, thank you for sharing! I love the fact she denied even knowing anyone and had bags on her. Ahhh, heroin addiction. This is SUCH a good story.  Your writing is awesome dude.Amazing story

Enjoy & take care of yourself ;)Junkie bukowski?How has your life been since that experience?
Have you settled down at all or are you still a drifter?
Do you regret this at all?Your writing reminds me of Augusten Burroughs. Specifically his book [Dry](http://www.amazon.com/Dry-Memoir-Augusten-Burroughs/dp/B006Z2UC5A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341542373&sr=1-1&keywords=Dry+Augusten+Burroughs).This is one of the most interesting stories I've read here. I've always wondered what it's like just to go for it, you know?Interesting. I wish my story of copping dope of the streets of Chicago was as heartwarming.As many people have said already, your writing style is fantastic. I even paged through your submitted history just to check if you had any other posts like this one, so I could read more of your stuff. I really hope I get to read something else by you one day, and I mean that. Don't go anywhere, my fellow redditor.Hey man, keep writing. That's good shit. Reminds me a bit of Stephen Elliot... my current favorite author. Nice writing... I forgot I was reading on Reddit. Good story.Isn't heroin one of the most dangerous drugs out there both in terms of addiction and the harm it causes?Your skill with writing is sharp. Consider a full novel, as I would buy it. This reminds me a bit of the tone and diction of The Catcher in the Rye.Great story. I know I'm late to the party on this post but I loved reading it some 120 days later.Your writing is great, but it's all about you and how you feel when you do or don't get high.

My brother died seven months ago from that stuff.  He was an enormously loving person, but hurt everyone he knew because of his habit.

Get help.  If not for yourself, for the ones who care about you.Really, is this the response reddit?  That this is a charming story and OP is quaint and adorable?  This is a sad story of drug abuse, not something to be commended. Yes, OP, thank you for sharing your story. It's valuable and gives an insight into your world. But, this is not something to applaud, people. Are we so fucked as a society that we look at this type of person and say yes, good on you, we support you?  May I am just ole but as eloquent as op is here, I can't endorse the behavior. Fun read, bro! I agree with the good writing skill. Many Redditors are good writers I've come to notice, definitely keeps your attention.

That's cool everything worked out so well for you, especially getting lucky the first try. I've found out over time as well that giving "bums" change opens up a lot of doors. Last time it happened for me, I was sitting on an arterial street underneath the expressway on the west side of Chicago, at a light. A guy with a cup walked up and down the row of cars, and when he got to me I threw a couple quarters in his cup. First words out of his mouth after that were, "y'all need them blows?"... wasn't looking at the time, so I declined. Have had similar situations pop up though many times. One of the added pluses of being in the city; whatever you want is never far away.wow, this was really great. at first i thought it was just a repost of the old poppy tea drinkers demise story... but this was far better. i really enjoyed reading this and it kind of shed a happy light on an otherwise dark subject.So is "Tracie" your friend or the homeless person?Such a great story. i too love opiates. but i limit myself on this so called "forbidden fruit". your story was awe inspiring. write a book about it man.A fine read. Thank you for sharing.
[deleted]What does it feel like? what did you do after you snorted it? I want to know more.How's your use nowadays? I used to use oxycodone, gave me massive headaches and no euphoria but I still got a mild addiction.

Was pretty annoying, I have an addictive personality so I use (well.. try) everything sparingly.That was an enjoyable read. Thanks!That sounds like a good time, serious. Superbly written, I really enjoyed your story :)I thoroughly enjoyed writing.

I won't get into the drugs subject - to each his own. I must, though, salute your writing skills. I really liked reading it.I got nervous just reading this. thank you for shining a light on this world for me.Chemical romanceThis is a great read. It also scared the shit out of me and reinforced my intent never ever to fuck with drugs.This was a fun story from someone who has been there! Having hair down to my ass was GREAT for copping dope but God forbid if the random Chicago pig saw me...instant stop and search! Its a double-edged sword...

Thanks for sharing your story!I'm glad you x-posted this. It was a great read.I love this.  I hope all is well for everyone in your travels including yourself![deleted]Your writing is average.TL;DRI really appreciate your feedback about my writing.  I worked on this story for a long time, and it's so nice to hear that it resonated for people.  I plan on taking your advice and submitting my writing for publication in the near future.  Again, thank you for your kindness and warm words.Thank you, kind sir or lady.[deleted]it really was and I have a worse attention span than anybody I've metThey are called urinals nowDo you mean [Confessions of a Dope Dealer](http://www.sheldonnorberg.com/book.html)?

Great read.Yea!  Can't say I didn't warn you though. :-)  I'll try to stay safe.Also came here from depthhub, fascinating read. Curious what sort of withdrawals you went through (if any) as someone who did h without actually injecting it.Awesome!You are a beautiful writer.  Thank you for your comments.That was touching. Thank you.Thank you.  I appreciate your kind words.  Having a clean cut look is definitely an asset when it comes to avoiding detection, but a major liability when trying to make a connection for H.Not all users become addicts.  But every user who uses risks addiction.  What I'm doing IS risky.  I appreciate your feedback.  Thank you.How do you know he became a habitual user? yeah i bet he will be the one guy dope leaves alone.

 i know there are supposedly "functioning addicts", but i have never met one and have. a sneaking suspicion that "functioning addicts" are only people who just started.

proof reading this made me want to say i am not attacking you, just pointing out what i think is a sad reality.

edit: i am bad at proofreadingI appreciate your kind words about my writing.Maybe you're the one that needs help. 10 connects?  I officially hate you. :-PThanks.  Yea, I felt out of place.  Good luck with retrieving your login info!Thanks!Thanks.This happened about a year ago.  I'm relatively settled for a dude in his mid-twenties.  I've been living in the same area for a couple of years.  I still use heroin seasonally and have zero regrets.Thanks, I'll check him out.Thanks for your kind words. Haha, no shit right?

Nothing romantic about waiting in your car off some sketchy sidestreet for "10 more minutes" as you see 3 cops roll past... Copping on the west side can be terribly frightening, but the results are usually WAY worth it!  :-)Thank you.Thanks, I'll check him out.Hey, thanks, that's very kind of you."In many ways heroin is as harmless as caffeine and it is definitely less harmful than alcohol. Heroin has garnered the reputation of the deadliest and most evil of drugs largely due to side-effects from the War on Drugs."

http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/feb/03/drugsandalcohol.drugsThat's very kind of you.  Thank you.Thanks! :-)I'm sorry for your loss.A fucked up society is indeed one in which people feel the need to either look down upon or endorse someone else's private endeavors.  
OP's not hurting anybody, so give it a rest, Judge.Thanks for your comment, I appreciate the feedback.[deleted]Yea, the first paragraph really does make it sound like that.  Have you ever read [this poppy drinkers demise story](http://www.alternet.org/drugs/21673/)?  I appreciate your kind words. Tracie was the homeless person.Thanks for your kind words.What about alcohol/coffee/weed?I like this description of the opiate high:

"Fifteen minutes after downing my first bowl of poppy-pod tea, I entered "Flanders Fields," from the John McCrae poem: Where the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row.

Death was a possibility, I knew.

Immediately, I felt redeemed. The raw reel of life became distant, pleasant. My head was an overstuffed pillow that could softly implode any minute, and it didn't matter. Nothing could. A pleasant pressure settled on the back of my neck. I was snacky. I wanted sweets. I felt the promise of a divine massage as the pressure spread through my shoulders and opened my ribs like wings. My thoughts slowed down until just about everything seemed to fold neatly inside everything else.

I became happily over-focused in the comfortable mud of abstraction and triumph; immortality bobbed around me like fat peaches in a hot tub."

It's been a while since this story took place, but to the best of my recollection, after I snorted heroin I walked around NYC, ate pizza, talked with random people, rode the subway, checked out Brooklyn, etc.  Nothing interesting or special.I'm a strictly seasonal user, venturing down to New York every three or four months.  I haven't used in about three months.  I plan to visit NYC again in September.

I like Oxycodone a lot, but don't come by it anymore.  Good luck to you sir.<3It was a great time.Thanks for your kind words.Thank you, I appreciate it.I'm glad you enjoyed it.Indeed.Is that where My Chemical Romance gets their name from? I know nothing about the band.Maybe it's for the best.  Thanks for your kind words.Thank you.Thank you, I appreciate your kind words.I would very much like to see your "how to cop in NYC" post.  Please send it my way or post it to /r/opiates -- I'm sure there'd be a lot of interest.  Thanks!!What do you mean? His grammar kind of sucks but I found his story telling prowess to be well above average. Only part that took me out of it was when he started to describe her Starbucks drink. That sounded forced and cliched. Thanks, I know.whats an example of excellent writing then?I purchased heroin in NYC.Seriously though, skill is nearly poetic. Keep it up, please.will you write a book please? i love reading about drug adventures. just don't make it like Requiem. that shit was too exaggerated. I've been able to "chip" on a seasonal basis for a while now.  I don't think about my drug use that much.  I have a lot on my plate right now: job, girlfriend, hobbies, traveling, etc.  In other words, I only have so many nerves to go around, so my worries about my future are more about regular, straight-laced stuff -- typical stuff that would bore you to tears.  Insufflating off-white powder heroin is a once-in-a-while treat, a vacation, and I intend to keep it that way.Well I've been clean for 2 years and I'm not too worried about ever going back to opiates, but yes I do worry about my future. There are a  lot of things I want to do in life that opiates have delayed.Ooh a squirrel!*Confessions of an Opium Eater* is infinitely more interesting, to me at least.didn't feel long though... yeah was a great storyYou should probably stop doing drugs.I've never experienced withdrawal.  You need to use every day for several days (more like a week, I hear) to get physical withdrawal symptoms.He did a bunch of follow ups, check his comment history. For example; http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ohdc/2_weeks_ago_i_tried_heroin_once_for_fun_and_made/2 weeks later: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ohdc/2_weeks_ago_i_tried_heroin_once_for_fun_and_made/

edit: oh, i had this tab open a long time, didn't see wacco's reply :)"functional addicts" probably don't go around advertising their habits.You have a talent man, I know people who have messed around with opiates, and they have addictive personalities too, 2 of them died before they reached thirty, one is sick but still alive, he's 37, do you take them just for the buzz or is it to help escape from something?may i ask why?

I'm pretty sure heroin users need more help then concerned redditors.I only really ever use 2 or 3 of them though. I've got one main connect that I see on the regular, and two backups. If for some reason those 3 don't answer (which almost never happens), then I will dip into the reserves. Connects come easy in North Jersey.Good ol' Independence blvd [deleted]Most of what I said was based on this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_(mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence).svgThank you.  Please just think about your family and friends.  And it's not just about how they would feel if they lost you, but it's what you're like to be around now.

My brother was extremely irritable and annoying to be around when he was in withdrawal and not getting high.  Then when he was getting high he kept to himself.  I almost don't know the potential of his personality for the past ten years of his life because the drugs kept him from us most of the time.

I appreciate your condolences, but I don't want anyone's sympathy.  I just don't want anyone to go through what our family went through.He abused her? She had the heroin when he met her. This is clearly a Thing that she does.His posts seem slightly suspect to me.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ke63/i_did_heroin_yesterday_i_am_not_a_drug_user_and/) in the original AMA from 2 years ago he says he just tried H for the first time.  Then [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mhys7/i_used_a_methadone_clinic_for_15_years_to_quit/) 7 months ago he claims to now be 4 years clean after using a methadone clinic for 1.5 years. If he tried it for the first time 2 years ago I don't know how he could be 4 and a half years clean.

[deleted]Uhhh, I think those are a little bit different.Nice... maybe i've met you somewhere, and then as all new yorkers do, forget everything about the people they met five minutes before.Get help for fucks sakeNo idea. I thought it sounded cool. I'm not familiar with the band either, only by name.Oh it's probably above-average, but not really remarkable.  Some parts of it are good, others are kind of bad.  He tells a good story though.  The circle-jerking, "Oh my gerd you got da talents!" Pisses me off.  If he had told a normal story but one that didn't involve using heroin, far fewer people would have been patting him on the back.  It's a patronizing, "Don't waste your life, you have talent" thing.Thanks, your kind words are appreciated.That's very kind of you to ask.  I'm glad you enjoyed my writing.ASS TO ASShttp://www.vice.com/read/amphe-nothing-is-wrong-if-it-feels-goodYou're commenting on a month old post about someone who has a short attention span. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I found the incongruity funny.I can't help but hear that in al pacinos voice from dog day afternoon. I'll see your confessions and raise you one Diary of a Drug Fiend.  
So so good. [deleted]You should probably stop being a cunt.Fair enough; as someone who'se done a fair few different drugs, and never experienced any sort of withdrawals, been curious for a while about what, if anything, I'd possibly go through after trying H without actually injecting.I'm sorry to hear about your friends.  I don't have an addictive personality and am able to "chip" on a seasonal basis.  A "chipper" is a non-addicted user. [By some estimates](http://www.heroinhelper.com/user/misc/chipper_tips.shtml), these heroin "chippers" outnumber addicts 5-1.

I take opiates because they make me feel wonderful. Some people like alcohol, some people like sky-diving,  I like long distance biking, web-development, watching HBO's Girls with my girlfriend, and occasionally insufflating dope.  Perhaps forbidden fruit is the tastiest kind there is?

Glad you enjoyed my writing. So I take it you don't use?You'll always be the superior one. No matter what compelling argument we make you will never change your perspective on Opiates until you or a close friend delves deep into the abyss that many, like you, have such a vivid imagination about but have never actually seen.

Quite unfortunate, really. It's terrible when one thinks they are the enlightened ones and the open-mined being, when in-fact you are far from it. We all think so highly of ourselves, don't we? 

I suggest you just don't answer something you don't understand, kid. Hehe, my "spot" was traditionally around Cicero and Chicago! Used to get wikkistix off Independence though! These days there are good spots in Oak Pk so no more worrying about the insane Chicago five-oh! :-)Thanks for the background information.  "assuming it is clean in a regulated legal market" is a pretty big assumption. I know that using heroin (even occasionally) is risky business.  I believe your comments spring from a genuine concern about what'll happen to me.  Thank you.They say that you can tell a junkie is lying by looking at his mouth: if the lips are moving and air seems to be coming out, he is.Fair enough, you're a special person that every group needs.>  I've never done drugs,

Talking about drugs, what is different? Not the socio/economics factor.Thank you for your concern.Nah, it's actually quite good. Did you have a piece get rejected or something? I can see where you're coming from in regards to the responses being patronising, but it's a shame you decided to just come into this thread and post a worthless and rude comment like 'Your writing is average.'

People love to be critics. I see it constantly whenever there's a video or post relating to someone obviously talented. Someone will feel the need to chip in with "Oh, actually he was kind of flat" even if the singer is one of the best in the world and the performance was near-perfect. What I never see though is a well put together examination of the performance. Can you give a detailed explanation of the faults in his writing ability? I'm guessing you can't be bothered to give anything approaching constructive criticism, which is also a shame.My point exactly. And no vomiting in the clam chowder! Or amputations!! Thats my only request. It was almost too good. At a certain point I wanted to stop reading because I was so into it that I was afraid I might end up doing ~~heroine~~ heroin. [removed]You're not going to experience withdrawal if you decide to experiment once.  It takes a while.  But there are still risks -- legal, physical, and psychological.  I'd recommenced checking out [HeroinHelper.com](http://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/) and [Erowid.org](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin.shtml) for more information.That's funny, the first thing I thought of when you said opiate teas was Girls. 

I breezed through your post despite having an abysmal attention span, by the way. Take care of yourself. >So I take it you don't use?  

you got "bestof"'d so there'll be a lot of those coming in nowI just want to point out that you skipped everything on your to-do list in order to do heroin.  I'd say you have an addictive personality, even if you don't have a chemical addiction to heroin.>I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.

But you're insisting you don't have an addictive personality. This is a massive red flag right here. Please, please don't do Heroin again, if you were seriously missing Opiates and went looking for Heroin you aren't the "Chipper" you believe you are.That's interesting that "chippers" outnumber addicts 5-1. I really had no idea. I've met two people that have done heroin. One of them was an addict for several years but she's been clean since I've known her which is about 5 years or so. And my other friend does heroin once a year. It's like his christmas present to himself basically. 

It's interesting because they both have very different opinions on the stuff. The girl swears up and down it's the worst thing she ever did. My the guy absolutely loves it. 

I've no desire to try it myself but I found your story fascinating, and as others have said, your writing it thoroughly enjoyable! I hope one day you endeavor to write a book about your life. I bet it would be an interesting tale. 

Take care sir. Take what ferrarisnowday and F1A said to heart, and don't try to pawn off your addiction as a clever term, chipper. Even your username relates to opiates. All it takes is an unbalance of your life to throw you two steps above Tracie situation, or a full-blown unwelcome window washer. I have an addictive personality. But have been around two friends who claimed they didn't. Possible. But their life was a tightrope walk between "normality" and falling into the abyss. Don't play the game. You may like the wonderful high, but you also like the risk. I don't mean to chastise you. I went through an addiction on the opposite end of the spectrum and would hate to see someone with smooth writing talent lose it over the fleeting feeling of wonderful. Great read.   One question:  Do you not see how quickly you might become Tracie in this story?   Doesn't everyone start this stuff thinking they handle it, her included?

You yourself abdicated your entire planned agenda, and spent your time in NY chasing the high, or in toilets getting it.  Now you appear to be rationalizing it after the fact (don't have an addictive personality, chipper, etc.).   I understand this is why you went to NY, but the insidious nature of opiate addiction starts with these seemingly little decisions.

Be careful, man.  It's a slippery slope you are on.    Good luck.[deleted][But heroin's a gateway drug!](http://i.imgur.com/l5Yfu.png)Just because the word Chipper exists, it doesn't mean you are one. You're a regular user who went to NYC to do heroin. You're a full on addict. Great story though! Found it on /r/depthhub. Learnt a new word, am insufflating bitches tonight !I've seen heroin addiction, I'm not quite as naive as you think. I know it's not a black and white issue, but you don't need to be a genuis to say to yourself ''This probably won't end well for me.''

I suggest you just don't get into debates with someone about the advantages of opiates on the internet, kid.Yeah, I originally planned on heading to Cicero (I headed to Chicago from Wisconsin specifically to cop) but I was approached as soon as I got off the Eisenhower so I stuck around Independence ;) People are dying out there because the government refuses to regulate drugs.[deleted]He could be refering to hard drugs, even weed. Caffiene is as good of a drug as children's aspirin and alchohol is fine in moderation. No, I'm not a writer.Look man I'm just trying to lash out angrily, stop using thoughts.Only heroes do heroines. [deleted]I felt so ridiculous for Girls being the first place my head went. Glad I wasn't the only one :D Thanks, you too brother.How come? I've been watching the show, but was there any reference to opiates in it?I think the fact that he's done heroin more than once without becoming a serious addict pretty much proves that he doesn't have an addictive personality. Is he capable of becoming an addict? Almost certainly yes, but that doesn't mean he's got an addictive personality. Those people are all extremely impulsive by nature.Thanks for your feedback.GeminiLife, I really appreciate your kind words.  Thanks for your feedback.  It was interesting to hear about your friends' different perspectives.I appreciate your comments.  I love "the fleeting feeling of wonderful." 2scoops, I appreciate your concern, probing questions, and feedback about my writing.

I don't disagree with you about anything.  Tracie did think that she could handle it, just like I think that I can handle it.  What I'm doing is not safe.  Fucking with heroin is risky business, any way you cut it.I'm looking forward to trying Opana some day.  Thanks for your kind words about my story.Thanks for your feedback.Interesting! So I assume that there isn't much of a scene in Milwaukee? I'm not surprised.Exactly.  I totally agree with you.  I think that most of the dangers associated with heroin stem from its prohibition.  Addiction, overdose, disease transmission, etc. would be reduced if it were legal.  Portugal is an interesting case study.

From Wikipedia:

"In 2001, Portugal became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession. In addition, drug users were to be targeted with therapy rather than prison sentences. Research commissioned by the Cato Institute and led by Glenn Greenwald found that in the five years after the start of decriminalisation, illegal drug use by teenagers had declined, the rate of HIV infections among drug users had dropped, deaths related to heroin and similar drugs had been cut by more than half, and the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction had doubled."Almost everything is fine in moderation.. Compaing caffeine's addictive and health hazard qualities to other "hard drugs" it's worse for your health.
I'd link a graph but I cbf
I don't want the discussion to go this way.

Your thinking of the drugs from a social standpoint, I'm thinking of them from a logic/health hazard standpoint.
Based of this: >  is as good of a drug as children's

Touché.I think it was the first episode, where somebody makes opiate tea and the main character gets really high and then goes to her parents' hotel to beg for money, passes out. Well, if you go in clearly appreciating the risks, good luck to you, my man.   

I must say that I can't recall a single story that went " I started taking heroin...", and ended with "...and things turned out great!".   The opposite case seems abundantly prevalent, however.  

I'd strongly suggest you to get out while you still can, but you already know that.... :)

Please accept my final comment in the spirit it is intended.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that your wisdom catches up with your obvious talent.  
   [deleted]Haha good to see you not lose your temper at these ignorant beings.


There is, it's just not an open air market like Chicago [deleted]I dunno, I've just never seen any facts on heroin being good for you.Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks!Thank you for your kind words.  But please be aware that you're not going to hear about the untold thousands of successful unaddicted heroin users, not because they're such rare birds (in fact, we constitute the majority of users) -- but because the successful casual user is going to go to great lengths to conceal their use due to draconian sentencing guidelines for drug possession and archaic social stigmas.Yea, I look forward to trying some Opana if I can find some.  Maybe after my next trip to New York I'll do another retrospective.  Thanks again for the feedback.Interesting, always wanted know that!I wish I had more than 1 upvote to give you, sir.Lol dude Bayer used to sell the stuff in bottles around 1902 to cure all sorts of aliments. Me either(and I never said it was).

"good" and "bad" are not words which should be used often when talking about intake. (through food/medicine/vitamins/drugs, anything). They simply are too bland, and often don't describe the full effects.

Amen. "Eight varieties of Epipactis helleborine in central Europe (Lower Silesia, Poland) had their nectar studied and they were found to contain naturally occurring oxycodone (as well as another narcotic-like opioid) in minute amounts."When people ask if I believe in God, yeah, this one.Well meme'd my friendLike Frank Gallagher said in Shameless: "somebody should gave a nobel prize to the inventor of oxycodone" 

And damn, it's so fucking true! �I'm so glad to be an atheist In all honesty, I’d rather hydromorphone or oxymorphone. Satan created Tylenol Real shit Satan is happy about fentanylThey need to check the soil, its possible those plants were watered with municipal sewage water etc.

There was a stunning story a couple years back about the discovery of naturally occurring tramadol in an African tree, further investigation showed it was from human urine the tree took up and the source was really pharmaceutical.I'd like to know more.Oxy*morphone. There's Both the codeine and the morphine variant.And then decided to put them in opiates to ruin themFuckin rightThat's wha I'm talk'n bouu[deleted]I thought tram was completely synthetic?  That's like saying there's a tree out there with plastic leaves.I believe in god - crack, not heroin lol.And Mac Miller /:It is, thats why it was even a story that they tested leaves from this tree and found tramadol. Like a said a followup showed it was not naturally occurring and was from rancher pee that had taken pills.I think this was related to the o-DesMethylTramadol in Kratom thing, Krypton or whatever it was called.
Methamphetamlne and Diacetylmorphine(Heroin) can both theoretically under the right conditions form in natureMac was cocaine laced with fent.Ooohhh.  That's some crazyshitI dont think anyone laces coke with fent. If I bought coke that made me sleepy like fent I would probably not buy from that guy again at least without testing it first.i think there might be some cross contamination where a trace amount might get in but putting fent in coke is a great way to lose customers quick.It's honestly more likely he got xan pressies that contained fent and took one for some landing gear after his yipp.  I know there are rare cases of coke being cut w/ fent, but I just doubt that's the case here.  But Wtf do I or anyone know?Fent is laced in everything. A trace amount is all it takes to kill you if you don't have an opioid tolerance. Very powerful stuff. please don't make harmful assumptions like this. I know it's hard to believe but this is a problem that's killed many, including two people I'd met.

the article is from 2016 too, it ain't new @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Me watching this sub having no idea how to get hold of any drugs., Content: , ups: 716, downs: 0just boof some kratom, my bois honestly my life would have been so different if I never did drugs. I have been in 13 treatment centers if you don’t include outpatient or five day detoxes.  Twice in the nuthouse one was 45 days on a 302 involuntarily commitment the other was a 9 month partial hospitalization where I just went home to sled. On three suboxone programs currently in my third methadone clinic. Twice in jail, lots of good friends have passed away especially the last few years with fentynal. The true story of where it can take you is a lot different, and I know and knew some of the biggest guys and they end up in jail multiple times or disappeared all together. Literally had a friend get busted yesterday, her second but she will go for years. All that said I love the escape, the warm feeling you get, the excitement of just copping some good stuff even before you use it. But it’s insane to think the game is like it is on TV  or a movie it’s not. I had an awesome family that no longer has anything to do with me because of my in ability to stay clean . I have parents that are still married never drank or used and a brother two years older than me who has ONLY tried alcohol, I thank God he still is in my life and my best friend. I don’t know, nothing in me feels like people who haven’t done drugs are missing out on anything. I used to really believe that shit, but trust me the reality is far different... be careful out thereGoogle is your friend, Onions work tooYou can get all the benzos,  stims,  psychedelics,  and my favorite fent on the clearnet for dirt cheap from long term well vetted trusted vendors.  

If you want the real shit go to an open market like milwaukee, baltimore, Jersey, etc and score some dope for 5-10 bucks a point or some coke.  

Tianeptine is basically legal oxycodone and u can get that on ebay.  Phenibut is legal lyrica/baclofen you can get on nootropic websites...you just arent tryin hard, or at ALL. No excuse nowadays. I don't think it's ever been this easy.Lmfao same tho Ohhmygoshh, this is brilliant. I feel the same way. I have to go 3 hrs to pick up then 3 back, so right now this is me trying to seek out closer to my home cuz I dont have time before work. Ugh. Yeah this is how I feel when it seems everybody in here, *but me,* has re-upped their scripts and I'm on the verge of or in WD. It's a crazy thing! �

But I love my Opi family here. This is one of the only places I don't receive judgement. This thread has delivered... � � � Make someHow your guitar pick looks at you when you drop it in your guitarGet my free monthly refill of perks and morphine tomorrow. Can't wait !In most cases, in the end, its the other way around.

Yeah, seems right, all the dope fiends holed up inside their houses shooting up while longing for a semblance of normality and wondering how people can actually enjoy doing stuff when not smacked up. Best thing I did was quit drugs (especially H) two weeks ago. Now I want to kill myself for completely different reasons, but at least I feel less alienated.

Really, it might seem fun at first, but there's nothing to envy. If you like altered mind states, stick to weed and psychedelics (is what I wish someone had told me earlier, although they probably did and I paid no attention).

Also, there can be functional addicts, as is the case with most drugs, but it is a big risk to take. I thought I had everything going fine for me, but when the last person who tolerated you left you out of fear and lack of love, you realize you don't even need to be lying in a gutter and shooting up with used needles to be in the shit, although that does help. In any case, you can always sink lower, that is a really easy thing to do on opiates (and on most drugs, I suppose).[removed]This picture is a bad description of drug use lol. But seriously , you do not want to do drugs , shit will only bring bad things.Be glad you don’t have access unless you want to need ppl like the guy who made the first commentYou gotta dream about a web that goes deepSame but its intentional. You do not want to be sitting on this sub, missing the feeling of an opiate rush so much it makes you sweat. Getting a catch in your chest when you think about how hitting a crack pipe after all this time would be earth shattering. You don't want the aftermath. Trust. A year later and I still don't feel back to normal...this IS normal now. No confidence, constant fear, anxiety...opiates made me functional before they didn't anymore. Drugs are so awesome they fucking suck.Not worth it.Tbh when I was younger I could get anything I wanted and I thought that was cool. Now aside from cold copping I can't get anything hard and I deff prefer it that way. Maybe Patrick and SpongeBob od tomo and you'll be inside thinking damn glad I didn't go hang out with them. Eh do what you gotta do man. I know what that feels like. I for one am happy I didn’t make any life changing decisions when I was in the dumps though. Because I would’ve regretted it nowLol this post is the most popular ive seen in a minuteThat’s a good thing?I promise that you don’t want to get a hold of these. Super wish I wasn’t able to get a hold of them in the first place What you mean If they would legalize ranch already, this wouldn't be an issue. [removed]Best comment on this thread. I just boofed my morning kratom/coffee/tobacco cocktail. Added in some vape juice to help lube up my boof hole.Nipping is where it's at, just rub that shit all over your nips. There's no coming back from a nipping addiction. You'll be screaming into old men's assholes in no time. It's a nightmare.Nah bro, ketamine. Everyones sleeping on ketamine...aha, another fan of adam!Is this sourcing? ��Good way to catch a caserc’s bro....cmonIdk man, living in an extremely rural town in the US (my graduating class had like 60 ppl in it) hours away from a major city, not owning a computer, not having any friends that are fellow junkies, & not learning how to use the darknet before reddit & other sources made it hard to talk about on their sites has made it pretty tough for me :/ 

I would kill to find a darknet coach, but I need to stop being poor so I can get a computer first. 

Btw sorry if this comment was poorly written, it's 7 am where I live & I haven't slept yet, so I'm pretty out of it.Are the darknet markets still going? Used to buy back in the days of SR but not in a living situation where I can order to home right now. Haven't heard anything of the markets since the dnm subs were banned.The dopes expensive as shit though. fr. im sober now and cant walk thru downtown (not even that big of a city) with out getting ppl offering me dope and coke. not to mention messages on my phone. shit is too easy frI'm a chronic patient with PKD, extremely close to suicide due to medication denial and this comment is fucking enraging. I haven't been able to obtain shit for over 4 years because I can't leave the house. I don't know anybody. I can't go anywhere. My health is fucked to near death because of pain medication denial and also now anxiety medication denial. What the fuck do I do to not die because every fucking constant attempt and every doctor I can reach in or anywhere near Boulder has failed me and left me for dead. And after that, when the only path left to help was a lawsuit, nobody would help me eitner. So, Seriously if I can't get anything to change I'm dead very soon. I don't know how to fucking encrypt shit. The idea of trying to figure shit out just makes me want to jump off my fucking building. But so does everything. I can barely function enough to put a half coherent comment together. Fml. I've got nothing left to give when it comes to functioning - I've been. legally disabled for nearly a decade now - but at least being unable to eat normally or have fun means spare cash...

Eta [TONS OF PEOPLE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/9i0ieb/the_current_us_pain_crisis_caused_by_opioid) are in this position and pain suicide numbers are increasing constantly. Mostly in the disabled and elderly who don't know how to use the regular internet let alone the fucking dark web. Being disabled and abandoned by doctors is extremely normal in the US and one in ten suicides is now a result of unmanaged chronic pain. Honestly I can't wait to join them. It's been a long time since I couldn't take it anymore.

Eta. I've always used meds responsibly. I've never been addicted to anything and I don't know what withdrawals feel like beyond hearing other people's stories. They took my meds away for no reason but opioid hysteria. I feel you I have a 3 hour round trip and it sucks!Hey just wanted to say that your 2 weeks is awesome! Even though you still feel shitty keep in mind although your psychical body may be out of the woods, it takes a little longer for the brain to normalize. So it will get better! Hope the best for you man keep it upOoooooo look at you, cool guy!! �� congrats man, i think this is your best comment around here.  its *useful* as a warning to not do dope, AND as a reminder not to type like an idiot!  ������This has to be a copypasta I feel like people here constantly wrongly assume someone’s a brand new sprint chicken on the opiate cruise when it’s probably not true the majority of the time. You don’t know anything about OP besides the fact that he can’t get drugs right now for whatever reason. Maybe he’s been in the game longer than you, you have no idea.


.

And what’s this thinly veiled bragging your disguising as “advice” like your passing on the knowledge to some brand new fresh out of the fridge motherfucker. I feel like someone who’s been in the game isn’t going to be holding opioid addiction like some kind of trophy. Like what you’re doing now

.

Lame as fuck.I, for one, find you hilarious and would like to see more comments. Keep up the good work! GAnGgangThis douche bag again. If you so busy trapping why tf you on here. Foh wat r u doing in this communityGuaranteed a white boy 16 or younger on his moms computer in the back room of their double wide, lmao your history is about acting like a thug on this sub and lookin up how to build gaming computers lmao get a life kid☝️Dude i ive stumbling across your comments lately.  Why are you so fucking lit. some foos after you ? then clean house and gtfo. La area would take you in with open arms just chill out and stop talking so unnecessarily assertive..we've  all have gone through hell and high water here just like you.  I'm sure many will vouch on that, just chill bro.  Have a nice day geeI think it's only partially wrong. It's sad to be hopelessly hooked. Addiction is ugly. Sometimes it's hell. All that is true, but the image depiction is also partially accurate. When we have our drugs at hand, well, it's fucking awesome. i think it just depends on who you are and why you use drugs. like my favorite drugs are dissociatives and i abused dxm in the past, but i'm over that now and even though i have a ready supply, i only use every few weeks/months. opiates make me nauseous and are fun and all, but i could never get addicted to them because i just don't like them enough to want to be high often. on the other hand, i have adhd and stimulants make me feel content in the same way opiates can be a 'magic pill' for tons of people that makes everything feel right, and me having access to meth would be very dangerous because i know i wouldn't have any kind of self control. i'm tired as fuck but i guess what i'm trying to say is drugs can be used recreationally or as tools in a healthy enough way just the same as they can fuck up your life. know thyself niggahttps://youtu.be/Uh7l8dx-h8MYou don't want to be sitting here reading and sobbing in uncontrollable rage because everyone seems able to get it except for you who instead gets to be in constant untreated searing climbing the walls and slashing your arms just for distraction

#**pain**

because of a permanent kidney disease and universal doctor refusal to medicate it. I will ban you. No  sourcing Don't forget turmeric to potentiate. That's the boof you'll never forgetEat some curcuma �Nah,brah. Sleeping on DMT is far more erfective. 
how the fuck do u get ket though, half the city is addicted to painkillers but literally nobody knows what ketamine isKetamine been my doc since I quit dope two years ago. 

Tolerance is weird tho it seems to be permanent. I take a few months break and still need the same amount. It’s not uncommon for me to do 1/4 gram in one go and still not come close to holing. I typically can effortlessly go threw an 8 ball in a weekend. No, it's not. No it's the krusty krabWell, so is driving to score from a dealer, to be fair. RCs are 100% legal in the US,  except bk edpb and etizolam are banned in a couple states. 

Ive bought RCs and steroids on and off for 10 years in the mail and never once got in trouble. And only ever lost one package which was refunded. Customs just takes your package that is all,  police do not get involved unless your quantity borders on trafficking size.  So dont buy a kilo of fent or a kilo of 2flurodesketamine and youre fine.  Its almost impossible to catch a case bro, esp buying from china.  Ive been in the RC a LONG time and have only seen 3 or 4 people ever get busted and that was when they were found all fucked up off the drugs by their local police. Fuck dude dn ant that hard I'll try and pm you some shit man. Just don't go too crazy lol

And yeah same I live in small ass town too and it is rough, no doubt. In my life I have only have come across like half dozen people who'll sell some decent shit. Even then I have to deal with bs prices[here you go](http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=dark+net+how+to)not owning a computer? nigga youre on the internet right nowDN is mega easy, people moved to dread after the subreddits got banned.Still going strongI got stuff sent a few times to a very tiny village in the south east of Finland; it took nine days to get there from the UK (I was starting to give up by the ninth morning I spent continuously shovelling snow by the postbox), but when it arrived, I thought:

"Humanity, we've finally done it. We've trascended. Far off are the days when you couldn't get gear sent to the middle of fucking nowhere right by shittons of square miles of forest and lake".Where the hell? Medical neglect of the disabled is so bad where I am, I'm considering moving If you are in that much pain I would give the darknet a shot. It is not as complicated as it sounds. Find the right info and you will be on your way in no time.Have you tried kratom?

[removed]omg can we please make it one?please tell me how they are "holding opioid addiction like it's some kind of trophy"

Well, by the title ("having no idea how to get hold of any drugs") it does seem like OP doesn't usually have much contact with drugs. Also "watching" makes them seem more detached, but especially the "any drugs" bit. It makes me think of someone saying they can't get "illegal drugs". Maybe I am overthinking it, but the title does send off a drug-naïve vibe.Yeah but when we’re high on drugs its a false reality that everything is great , the reality of it is that we’re slowing killing ourself & shit is not great but hey I’m no one to talk I’m a heavy user & I get what your saying i guess I’m just looking at it a different way ya knowI have never, ever taken prescription drugs. You have my deepest sympathy for people ruining it for everyone else with legitimate need. I truly am sorryI’ve actually heard this but never tried it. What’s the best way to take it? Just add the turmeric to my jar with the kratom and water? Turmeric is curcumaI want sour patch kids and whataburger taquitos. I'll stick with the horse tranquilizer lol.Depends where you live man, it's big here in the uk. I don't live in a big city but i have 2 guys i can get it off.What RC opioid are you talking about? Because all the ones worth a damn have been banned.You giving out dn tips? Can I hazCan I get a pm too bro? Hey thanks so much! :DLmao!!! I use my cell phone. I heard you're not supposed to use your cell phone to access the darknet. I don't know why, I don't know much about this stuff. I'm also pretty retarded when it comes to technology.

I just woke up & this cracked me up lmao thanks for the laugh!Thanks so much for the tip!! Seriously appreciate it :) I'm so fucking tired of being sick like 2 weeks a monthGood to know, thanks man.You are Finnish or just visiting ?  I would live to visit Finland.   Great quality of life there [removed]as in u cant get prescribed pills? im in 407Sir this is a Burger King I'm 90% sure this is an awful attempt at trollingDude you’re on an opiates subreddit bragging about being a dealer (which is the first indicator that you’re NOT a dealer), and you’re talking shit about people that use opiates. Oh and somewhere in there, you’re talking about fucking someone’s bitch. 

Seriously, get a life. Or try harder to get the 9-5 that you really “wanna work”.  You sound lazy and ignorant, and you have no right to put anyone else down. Plus, you use way too many fucking emojis. Why can't you work a 9-5? Is it because you're mentally handicapped and can barely spell? Why cant you work a 9-5?What do you mean you can't work a 9-5? Motherfucker get your lazy ass out of here and go get a job like the rest of us. Ease up on the '100' emojis while you're at it. Makes you look like a fuckin' teenager. What a clown. This reads like a rap trackverified esports pro?? thought this trap shit wasnt no game"ain't nothing cool" �Unless u wanna be homeless begging niggas like me for a bag and we make you steal a car radio stay out the dope game �� shit ain’t pretty I eat breath and wake up to this shit my phone jumping every minute �� I have customers coming from out of town to buy my dope niggas my shit FIRE knock yo ass out boy real trap shit u don’t wanna need this shit cause one day ima fuck your bitch be sleep so I don’t pick up and u gonna be sick You're right tho. It's kinda sad. Opioids changed my brain *so much*, that they are almost everything to me. For real, they're everything. If I don't have them, everything is pure hell. But if I have them, man, it's wonderful. I don't even need to be high from 140mg of oxy 24 hours every day as I would like to. 20mg just to be well and feeling slightly nice is enough for killing my depression and anxiety.

I don't really care if it's a false reality (I don't actually agree with the concept of false reality in a way), I love the way they make me feel. They take alway all my pain and give me a peace nothing else gives me, so I'm against depicting addiction in a complete negative way. If there were only negative aspects, there wouldn't be so much addicts I guess. But as I said, you're still right in a way. Addiction is ugly in a broad sense. And most times it's not worth it.So here's my way:
1. Drink some grapefruit juice roughly 2 hours before 
2. You gotta have an empty stomach
3. Consume the kratom with some lemon-juice and optianally some peper
4. The curcuma can be consumed anytime after the kratom beginns to hit, but preferably after "the peak"
5. Drink some coffe, this will potentiate the kratom euphoria immensly but will remove the sedative effect a bit
6. Eat something fatty or better; just drink butter-coffee
7. Enjoy your maximum kratom buzz but the nausea will rize, too It’s true. He called me to bring over a bag of ice. I thought he was going to ice his ass after the Tabasco ass but Dude boofed the entire bag of ice��‍♂️ I been telling him to change his name from ResistingNut to BoofingGangstaBro I hate that they stop serving breakfast at 11am.

I liked snow too, emphasis on the /-ed/ past suffix; my feelings towards it waned a little after the hundredth day of shovelling snow, but it's true you can't beat the old sauna and rolling in the snow routine (although it feels really dangerous when you're drunk).

For the other thing, I'll send you a PM.We can't share vendor or market info here. 772You got me lmao lolThis is the most underrated post of my  entire 27 year existence. Ohmygod hahahaha ��no this is Patrick 100%. 28 karma, and not to mention his name is VerifiedEsportsPro..I hope so.

I think it's all great till its not....and when it's not you're in a living hell real fast.I fucking love butter coffee!! I’ll give this a shot tomorrow when I take my dose! Thanks mate! It should also be mentioned that this is not a means of tolerance reversal or reduction. It will still count toward your tolerance and probably be worse for it than just taking it normally. ��� if I could upvote this more I would. I was in line the other day for breakfast and got up there to the register to order my food, all pumped to get down and dirty nasty on some taquitos, order my food and get hit with, “oh sorry sir we stopped serving breakfast one minute ago.” Get on the dark web man, there are good subreddits for figuring out how to be safe ordering stuff. It's well worth it imo.Annnddd I have yet to find ANY positive information on the 3 you listed. Nothing but warnings about negative experiances.You're doing god's work sonMe too?  �[removed]Lmao no worries! I can take a joke �Sure does! I love mushrooms, especially the ones that make me 1337Can you remove the cities? [removed]He done a goofHaha agree with the chris hansen shit but where tf was the racism in that post? chris hansen WOOP WOOP� Because this isn't sarcasm. If he's making this character up then it's satire maybe, but definitely not sarcasm. I think he's just a jackass, like youImagine breaking into a car and you see all this stuff like someone's left their bag with money and phone etc. in it but your eyes move straight to the radio like "aww yeah man this'll get me at least a couple stamps"People in 90's movies/rap videosDoesnt matter when you have a steady lifetime supply for free from the methadone clinic like me and millioms of others. I get the equivalent of 300mg of oxy every single day and i love it.  I dont do ANY other drugs i don't even smoke weed.  All i need is my opies.  My tolerance is so fast they by the time i dose im in WD so i always feel good when i dose in the morning. 

I was on suboxone for 4 years and it did the same job for me for the entire time i was on it. Why was butter coffee already a thing The only tolerance reversal is time and sport Are you kidding me? One minute? That's bullshit. I used to work at McDonald's (a long time ago) and we would always sell whatever we had left from breakfast. I couldn't imagine telling a customer that lol.Yeah and they’ll tell you that shit at like 10:50. Drives me nuts lol i'd love to but my living situation doesn't really allow for that. it doesn't really matter though, i'm probably a lot better off without access to unlimited drugsIve tried all three, so has everyone else in my groups discord and wickr friends and we alll love them.  Super potent,  euphoric,  and 20 hour half lives.  Ive seen the posts you are talking about and sounds like those ppl got hit with bunk product by shit vendors. I hope people dont touch them,  less press means less chance of them cracking down further in china. Okay guys I really want to help all of you, honestly have no problem. Ive already been pming 3 different people adivce �. Please Google darknet Bible and do some reading, because there is a lot. Once you have read that just pm me any questions that you have. I feel like this is the best way for me to help you guys, rather than assuming that you guys know nothing and having to compose a giant message explaining things that so in debth and have already been covered in the Bible. The Bible would also do a lot better job explaining things than I will. But yeah pm me anything you are still confused on and I'll do my best to help. Again I'm not an expert. �Hey man I read my response to /r/theoneofem below and pm any questions you have I'll be more than happy to help youYou cannot mention that here.

I used to drink it everyday with Keto. nmda antagonists. idk how to get memantine prescribed but after some ket or dxm there's a noticeable decrease in stimulant and opiate tolerance. look up 'nmda opiate tolerance' and you'll find tons of research on it. i've also heard of gabapentin and magnesium having an effect on opiod tolerance but i know nothing about thatAgmatine.They do all day breakfast now, anyway. Yeah i stay away from it for the same reasons.What about a P.O. box?Telling a dude who can’t even find drugs, who probably has no tolerance, to start fucking with fent analogs and 3mmf is extremely irresponsible man. This is how people die. Just adding on to your comment r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs is a great place for anyone trying to get started. Do your research on both markets and vendors!! Always use 2FA and manual encryption.Cities in general aren't allowed, even if you don't live there at the moment.

**********FAIL*********[removed][deleted]Its opioids,  taken everyday,  from a doctor . It gets me high everyday taken as Rxd.  I hardly see a difference.  Opioids are opioids. Addiction is addiction. Use agmatine. Its more than just a nmda antagonist too, its a wonder supplement.When did i *EVER* reccomend he use fentanyl? I said stims,  benzos, and opioids are all available on the clearnet,  which they are. I never said go buy fentanyl analogues and bang them up man! I just listed whats available,  as if everyone didnt already know fent is available. Someone who is not OP asked which opioids,  so i listed them.  I NEVER once suggest anyone use them and if you read my last post i encouraged people NOT to use them.  Whats with reddit and putting words into peoples mouths?Sorry, won't make that mistake again.lmaoooooo. so good, so bad. LOLLmao Fucking dead ☠️Most runners have a burner bro, they don't use their everyday phone for running.. every dealer I've met has like at least 2 phones, usually 3 too.

I'm not your buddy, friend.You took the bait  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Lol shots fired, Content: , ups: 708, downs: 0Smoking weed doesn't make me want to do heroin. Sobriety does that all by itself.Not doing heroin makes me want to do heroin. I hate everyone.LmaoWeed makes me wanna use opiates cause it just gives me a sense of impending doom these days and I am craving relief.what about the ex junkies who *are* stoners?If I can’t do drugs you’re all losers for doing them.This hurt my soul lmaooActually no, I'll pass on that bowl. Don't want to fall in another psychosis and make my anxiety disorder strike me with double power.Used for 11 years flat out junkie for 6 of them. Got my medical card and smoke every day, haven’t used dope more than 4 times in the past almost 3 years nowVirgin weed ... chad heroin 

Fuck weed .. it just makes my anxiety worseWhenever I smoke. I feel super content with the level I'm at, and don't need anything elseBoof the weed! Fuck it, boof the dope too!!!See it's the opposite for me! If I smoke then I don't think about using.hahahaha ToucheOofAlmost everyone who does heroin for a substantial length of time eventually finds them self not enjoying weed at all it makes them to anxious and paranoid.

The only heroin users I know who like to smoke are ones who have continued to smoke weed throughout their heroin use.

But the way it goes for most is that all their time/money/everything becomes about heroin. Then one day they smile a bowl and end up having a panic attack.

As a long time heroin user the head change I get from smoking a bowl makes weed feel like a way stronger drug than heroin. The high from heroin in subtle and relaxing/a feeling of contentment/carefreeness. What in the end makes heroin a Stronger drug is its ability to cause dependence and withdrawal.

This may not be true during the initial stages of opiate use where the effects feel more profound but it is definitely true with long term addicts. There have been plenty of posts on here about it and heroin users who used to love weed/smoke all day everyday can no longer stand the stuff.

So I don’t agree with the meme at all.Weed is for kidsAfter doing dope why on earth would anyone wanna do weed? Iol. Keep it. Heroin solved all the problems I never knew I had. Till it rendered me poor and homeless. 32 months clean now but literally wouldn’t smoke weed if u paid me. Once you’ve seen the promised land there’s no going backAfter opioids, which I don't even use anymore, weed became worthless to meI’m still on opiates and I don’t like weed anyway. Will be trying CBD oil soon though to see if it’ll help with cravings and beyond that withdrawal. But no thanks to THCIf anything not smoking weed does that for meFactsI remember when weed would make me feel so happy and content with life no matter what was going on. I still used all sorts of other drugs to at the same time. Then at one point weed stopped having that affect. Now when I smoke its rarely enjoyable. Sometimes I'll get high with my brother n laugh and have a good time for a bit, but even then it's short-lived. Most the time I just overthink shit thats going on in my life or beat myself up over shit I did in the past, and makes me anxious and have zero confidence. So I end up feeling depressed/guilty/anxious usually over shit that never bothered me normally or shit from the past that didn't matter anymore. Sucks man I loved weed but now it affects me all weird n shit most the time.Ouch that hit the feelersThis translates to “I had a horrible time doing the drug you are doing and I took it because I was unhappy to the point of mental illness so I equate needing drugs to blocking out pain.”Ex-junkies bash on stoners because stoners are fuckin' obnoxious.

**Shut the fuck up**, do real drugs.

It's also so strange how some stoners can make weed into a huge part of their lifestyle or identity (weed shirts, weed tattoos, weed magazines, bob marley posters, all those kind of "look at me I smoke weed" accessories) and no one even bats an eye, but if you tell someone you took a couple vicodin before work they'll treat you like you're a total piece of shit junkie.  Honestly I've met full-on heroin addicts who don't talk about their drugs as often as average stonerfags do.Weed really is lame thoweed culture is awful. Unless marijuana is your income i roll my eyes when someone over 20 is "into" weed. It's like the default "interest" for losers no personality the same way being "into" craft beer is for people who don't do drugs. I smoke weed everyday but you wouldn't catch me dead wearing a weed shirt or shit like that.[deleted]Or if they are on parole, and this is so untrue its offensive....and not a lot offends me other then smelly PussyIf anything weed makes me not want to use. “sobriety does that all by itself” - couldn’t have said it better myself lmaoAmen to that !!  Lol100%  


time + sobriety + lonilnes = back or hair ronWow a guilded comment. You don’t see many of those around here.i feel the exact same way. weed used to chill me out and make me laugh a few years back. now it just gives me mad anxiety and makes me generally uncomfortable. i’ve tried to explain this every time to my friends and coworkers every time they ask me why i don’t want to smoke weed.Same. I wouldn’t smoke weed if they paid me how much it costs.yeah thats what im sayin, i smoke weed every day basically. it definitely does *not* make me want to bang dope again lolYeah srsly I hate that other people can just take a few norcos one weekend and not start looking for heroin on Monday.Makes me feel like the odd man out.
Shit is "natural", legal, and I can't take 2 tokes without fucking feeling insane.

I can kill a horse with the amount of coke or junk I can tolerate, but not 2 fucking tokes.Yep.What were the circumstances of those 4 times? How did you not fall back into routine abuse each time? And congratulations manWaaaaaay worse. I used to black out and everything!What you’re saying is true...but people who are clean, then think smoking will be fine cause they just want to get high and not go back to dope. Then we’re fucking sucks and isn’t even close to as good as heroin then you get the fuck its and want to go use dope. I think you think this meme is that they WANT to smoke weed. It’s not that, it’s that if we smoke weed, it sucks and will instantly go to banging dope cause we want to get actually high.Congratulations on 32 months. Big achievement. Keep it up.Yo, just a heads up- it doesn’t help with cravings or withdrawal for most people I know, including myself. It’s legal where I live and I tried that shit for awhile before I could get into a methadone program, and uh... nope.BANG THAT SHIT PUSSSSSSSYI see you’re getting downvotes but I wanna say, I agree with you 100% about stoners being obnoxious af. Now here come my downvotes lol.I don’t think anyone that also didn’t consider drug use as a part of their identity would be so mad at another person for doing the same thing. Stoners can be drug addicts too—just as obsessive and neurotic about their DoC as any junkie. You really ought to have more compassion for people who are also essentially sufferingwell shit, tell us how u rly feel lolI don't agree with the do real drugs part. When I was a stoner, (I never acted like what you described I was pretty down low about it) I was honestly extremely dependent on weed. It's obviously different, in my experience anyway, from opiate addiction but I think that you and many stoners as well don't get me wrong, are not correct in saying that weed is "not a real drug" and especially when people say that it's "not addictive". I was spending a couple of hundred dollars a week on bud for a long, long time. I would actually get some physical withdrawals, obviously nothing like opiates, but the psychological craving for weed was extremely powerful. I tried to quit countless times and failed. I fucked up a lot of relationships because I was constantly high from sun up, to sundown. Not even an exaggeration. I know a lot of people around here will laugh at me when I say this but marijuana ruined my life just as much as opiates did. (I never got into h though, didn't have access.) I do kind of agree with you about stoner culture though. I don't think that your average daily marijuana smoker actually acts like that but I know the types of people you are talking about and they are fucking obnoxious.I think it’s because when most addicts reach the point of addiction they realize this shit ain’t cool. 

I remember a time when I thought getting faded on some Vicodin while I’m in school made me kinda badass. It’s only once addiction slaps you in the face (or you just grow up) that you realize your an idiot for thinking your cool. Weed never hits that point so you never make that realizationThats weird. You had to have some idea on your own that weed is nothing like heroin. Obviously you never heard of people overdosing and dying from weed.So which is it, the back or the hair Ron?I’m torn on whether it’s an ex junkie who had extra money laying around or if it’s a current junkie with bad impulse controli’ve read a ton of comments in this sub i’ve wanted to give gold to but simply couldn’t afford itGilded! 
Also, have some of my poor man's gold�For real man. I loved weed all day every day until i got hooked on dope. Now weed just makes me paranoid and anxious af.There’s a theory that reality and introspection can be too much to handle all at once. If that’s something you’re prone to, consider getting a trip sitter to help you process and keep safe.I smole weed daily, but still want to bang dope daily but probably because im like 6 and a half months dope free so cravings are there. I don't act on the cravings but they're there regardless if I smoke or notI just straight up replaced dope with bud. Its pretty much the same crutch, instead of doing a lil dope and smoking a cig i smoke a bowl and then the cig. Like four or five times a day. Its obviously not the same but its better than nothing and its way cheaper, i can actually pay rent and survive.This..used to be me. i miss those days :(Same honestly. Always bugged me people freaked out when I was putting oxy in my nose, and they just refused to believe that weed makes me go bonkerz.I’m literally the same! I used to smoke weed but then it made me paranoid and anxious so I stopped. Never smoking again anytime soonBro this is fucking me. I was happy with bud. Used to have that anxiety relief waiting for me as soon as i exhaled the smoke. Was so nice and relaxing and now i cant even toke on a one hitter without feeling like im gonna have a panic attack. Thats why i quit.Raise your tolerence mate. Try out high CBD flower!Lol just smoke more weed. I’m at the point to where I barely even feel dabs. Lowkey sad. I never really liked the high from weed that much from the start though ngl.I just had enough man, I realized after knocking my head against the wall For years, that it was always gonna end the same way. Those 4 times were either from stress for 3 of them and one was for almost no reason at all. I just work 72 hours a week and it helps to keep me sober. Cannabis helps me rationalize my feelings and gives me a buffer to take a step back and think before reacting. I never really had money to smoke when I was buying dope so maybe I don’t associate them as strongly.If I smoked weed I would be all paranoid about something stupid having at work like some idiot hitting me with a fork truck and having to take a drug test. 

I can snort a fat opana line before work and fucking have a great day playing girls front line and Shit posting all dayI’ve got other stuff that CBD can help with like mental health, social anxiety and sleep problems. I am prescribed codeine for chronic pain but take way more than I should and it’s not a viable option to keep it up so I’m interested to see if the addiction will be easier to kick if I was properly medicated for my mental health and found an alternative for pain relief.

Edit: I don’t want to resort to methadone for a problem that is more of an inconvenience than a problem at this point.Bunch of stoners getting butt hurt because they feel like I’m attacking their whole identity. You guys need to hit a bong and chill out maaaan.Lol they’re not suffering as much as addicts in this sub. Those “types” are totally insufferable people that will never change or know what it’s like to reach highs above their heads.> Stoners can be drug addicts too—just as obsessive and neurotic about their DoC as any junkie.

I agree with this 100%, but I think the weird thing is that everyone else treats it like it's no big deal because it's "just weed."  Obviously yes, heroin is worse for you than weed, but I just think it's funny how you can take a total stoner guy who has made weed a huge part of their identity and is obsessed with it and everyone just goes "lol he's just a stoner" but you take someone who pops a few pills occasionally and people go "AHHH!! A JUNKIE!!!"Yeah man, I mean it’s like anything else. People who say that you CANT get addicted to weed are dumb. People get addicted to shopping, eating, porn, and drugs. Just because there’s no physical dependence with weed doesn’t mean it’s not addictive. I know plenty of stoners who would throw an absolute fit if they couldn’t smoke for a couple days.Marijuana didn't ruin your life, nor did opiates. You did that yourself. Just as when people recover and say that it was all god or some shit, nope. It was you and how you utilized your environment, not your environment utilizing youIt's not that, it's that idea that, because so much drug education lies about weed, that same education loses credibility on their claims about harder drugs when you realize weed is basically harmless.

I totally understand where that guy is coming from. The addiction is still the poster's *fault*, but I had that same kind of experience with DAREAA RonThank you!!!Oh I love getting introspective. I enjoy acid a ton and never have a problem on that. It’s just weed comes with so much paranoia and anxietyyeah either way pot definitely doesnt make it worse. There has got to be a better more common trigger to make a meme with, this one doesnt feel like a dope head even made it... whatever lol

&#x200B;

btw grats on 6 months man that shit is hardBetter for your physical and mental health long term too, but some people can't do itSame here. I start to question everything in my life. It's like every insecurity of mine gets amplified. 

Oh and I always think I'm dying.Big oof, unironically. I feel like you had it worse, since you had the experience.

I would totally be a stoner if I could. The idea of having a bowl ready as soon as I get home from work, just seems fantastic. I can't drink either, so damn, I got no realistic simple release.

Cbd, you have any experience with it? I kind of want to try it, but I'm so cynical and jaded.Ive been trying on and off for 25 years, high cbd or low THC, doesn't make much of a difference.
Every stoner I've met has some system, or plan, they're so certain that pot is perfect for everyone.
Like *so* sure that I've gotten in arguments with these guys telling me I'm doing it wrong or somehow just don't get it.

I've seen guys pick up Oxy, go for a week straight, and say 'meh' and drop it. I aint gonna yell at that mofo that he's somehow doing it wrong.

Shits different for different people.lol ?Smoke more weed? that will send them strait into psychosis, weed isn’t for everyone mateOh for sure, it helped me with some pretty bad joint inflammation/pain from my hep c, and some side effects from my bipolar meds. Just didn’t do much to help with cravings or withdrawals is all.

Edit: I really do hope you find whatever help you need tho! Methadone works for me but I understand MAT is not an option for everyone.I dated a girl recently who had to smoke pot every single time we hung out. I don’t smoke and yet she pressured me into smoking and then got mad when all I wanted to do was lay in bed....I told her that I’m a lightweight but she still insisted I smoke and smoke and smoke. Also told her that I’d get in trouble if someone found out she was smoking in my room (I live in a building that doesn’t tolerate that) but she didn’t care, she just HAD to do it. First time in my life I’ve ever seen someone addicted to weed.Junkies don’t have a monopoly on suffering man. That’s just your ego speaking. And to be clear, I am a junkie myselfNot even pills really. If you use pills habitually people will show some concern, but everyone freaks the fuck out when you mention the boogeyman heroin. Even if youre telling a story about doing it that one time.Yea I agree. I will say that I don't think the potential for addiction is as much as some other drugs, but certain types of people are definitely susceptible to pot addiction, myself included.Fair enough. Opiates can ruin your life no matter who you are though, don't make a mistake and think you are stronger than them. I agree marijuana is a different case. I guess a more accurate statement is that I was not strong enough to resist the influence of these drugs and that ruined my life, but that's kind of arguing semantics.Oh I totally get where both of you are coming from. BUT we all need to havr some personal responsibility in doing some research ourselves into things before we try them. I've smoked weed thousands of times and tried various drugs but not dope just because of the risk factor. I know there is a chance it could kill me and thats not a chance I want to take. Ya know what I mean?Well I've definitely have talked to a lot of dope users who have got clean and any substance will make them crave their doc. I never understood it but everyone's recovery is differnt. I can smoke daily and drink a few times a week and my cravings aren't more intense and sometimes non existent qhen I'm pretty fried and zoned out.

Definitely a case by case situation. Mainky why I don't go to meetings, I like the fellowship and communication but I cant be 100% honest without having all these old heads hop down my throat about weed and kratomAnything at this point gives me the anxiety. I was at my college for the first time and took CBD before i went, was so paranoid someone would think im on drugs i almost cried. My anxiety disorder is a bitch. Can't even take cbd anymore.. if an anxiety disorder is what you have, i recommend staying away from weed and trying CBD. dont be put down by my experience, its very rare that someone has what i have. Originally cbd helped me a LOT, and for a long time. Definitely try cbd in a small dose.when people say oxy just makes them sleepy i want to beat them halfway to death and see if a perc30 sounds good now but what you’ve written is factsI guarantee you that there will be no days long psychosis like with stims if you smoke s couple more bowls.

Greening our is not the same.It’s difficult to pinpoint exact problems though cause everything makes everything else worse and diagnosing has been a nightmare. I’m starting new antidepressants soon which will (hopefully) help me lose the weight the last ones made me gain and CBD might help me cope with side effects and bad days beyond that. But I’m not making bullshit promises to stop doing opiates when I have no reason or desire to stop. So I need to look at why and work from that angle. Idk. Thanks and good luck too, I might do an experiment and see if it helps with pain better than codeine and write about it if anything happens.My ex-gf was the same way. I don’t really smoke, never really cared for it, sometimes I’m down to take a couple rips if I’m already in bed and don’t have anything else to do that day. 

But man she smoked all the time. Basically from when she woke up, to right before bed. She’d smoke on her way to work, on her lunch break, and when she got off. Idk how she got anything accomplished. Well, actually, she didn’t get anything accomplished.

It was kind of unattractive. The fact that every time we hung out she had to get blitzed. I wasn’t even using opiates or anything at the time.Do you know the difference between benzo/opiate withdrawal and weed withdrawal. They don’t really compare. No matter how much weed you’d smoke.yeah, thats part of the reason I didnt get into NA much, the community is nice, but I couldnt do the total abstinence. I've been off dope for a long time, but was on subs forever, but anyway, im off everything opiate and cocaine now, but I still enjoy kratom and alcohol, and even a benzo once in a blue moon, and im fine. I still have cravings too but they've just flashes at this point, they disappear as soon as they come usually, but other substances dont make it worse. I mean its still a balance, but all of life is.

guess we are lucky to be able to use some things responsibly stillCan't stand 12 step groupsIm anxiety/depression/addiction.

I take SSRIs for the anxiety and depression but it's not perfect. It's just that for the past bunch of years, THC and cbd have been pushed as the cure for everything, so I dunno what is true or not. THC gives me panic attacks even at the smallest doses, I know cbd is supposed to not be psychoactive but yeah... Thanks for the insight.Lmao. It's like, well... Give me them, wtf are you doing them for? Lol.Stupid.Ugh I feel that hard. My life for awhile was a mess of differentiating symptoms and correlations between mental health issues, physical illnesses, medication side effects, and withdrawal related problems. It’s evened out quite a bit now and I finally have a solid grasp on what I need day to day and what I can do without.

I’d love to hear how it works for you if you try it or some other solutions!I do, yes. I am intimately familiar. I just detoxed myself from 4 mg Etizolam taken daily for over a year—been totally off only the last 9 days, so if anything I’m still in the thick of it—and while I have been stable on bupe for the last several years, I was previously on heroin for about 8. So yeah, I get detox, just as much or more than anyone else on this sub. And I’ll say this, detox is only a moment in time. It passes. And because it passes it really ought not to be the moment of comparison. You have no idea how other addicts—weed, heroin or otherwise—feel on a day to day basis. Some of them may very well be suicidal. Let me ask you a question: why do you feel the need to believe that your pain is greater than others? What do you get from that? I mean you just admitted that these people “never change”. How fucked up do you have to be such that you can never change?Ya definitely consider myself lucky, took me a second trip to rehab to pick this 6 months up. Longest I haven't taken opiates since I was 15 and am 21 as of last Wednesday so shits crazy. 

I had bits of no opiate use in the time frame and I only used a few times a month when I was 15 and 16 but once I turned 17 it was 3-7 days a week other than the few times I tried kicking. Shit feels good not having to have a needle and dope on me 24/7 and knowing my parents aren't thinking about me dieing daily is a plusRecovering from heroin and cocaine use is so different for everyone. I am glad more people realize that because for years I listened to 12 steppers tell me and others that if you dont hit bottom, and if you dont do 100% abstinence and do the program 100% you will relapse and die. I have heard that 100s of times from long timers speaking for everyone apparently. But I digress. I'm in no perfect position but my use is much less frequent and my life quality is 10x better being on maintenance and occasionally smoking weed, and using psychs rarely and having a half a drink once in a blue moon.Ya they think you have to do it one set way or you'll go back to your doc but everyone's recovery is differnt. My dad used to be a crackhead for years got clean in 98 the year I was born did na/aa for 5 years heavy and then eventually went back to smoking bud and drinking. Hasn't touched rock in 21 years, he had a drinking problem for a little while but nothing super crazy.

When I went to rehab I used it as a tool to stop opiates and benzos, but never had the intention to be 100% sober because thats not what I want in lifeForsure. Its different for everyone. You'll only know if it works for you if you try it. My advice, do it a day where you have nothing going on and free time on your hands, take no more than 5-10mg and see how you feel. Cheers.You’re stupid. Tolerance occurs with almost all drugsI was simply comparing the severity of withdrawal. I’ve had my fair share of suffering and suicidal ideation. 

I just know from personal experience that peoples’ personalities and world views rarely change.I think most anyone on this sub would know that there is a difference between opioid and weed withdrawal, it almost doesn’t need to be compared @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Stolen from r/ImGoingToHellForThis, Content: , ups: 706, downs: 0Lol no more wasting money on rehab and locking doorsI can set my purse down and come back & all my pills & money will still be there. What a relief.Lol that’s the kind of Humor I’m into I'm classy and graduated to bottle caps and bottoms of cans of beer/soda long ago. [deleted]i love it. they probably spent tens of thousands on rehab and various treatments anyway. lots of us would find that beneficial!“My son died and know I don’t have to count my spoons anymore”

Edit: i swear every addict has extremely dark humor! Idk if it’s the lifestyle or the fact that we’ve all lost so many friends that the way we deal with it is by dark humor!

Heroin/fetynal is legit killing our whole generation!
Our government really fucked up when they cut down hard on perks ...Knew a pretty bad h addict was staying at a friends in his garage as he apparently wasn’t even allowed inside. No it wasn’t only the spoons, but one time all the silverware went missing, probably traded for Fuck heating your shots, get a contact case, some saline and shake it up. Boom now you have shots for the day [deleted]Oofalmost no one will think of it this way. they'll probably blame themselves and wish they forced rehab on them. sounds like its time to kill the kidThat’s the al-anon version.Scavanged cans and mud puddle water...  Gotta boost your immune system!There’s been a lot of research reports about shooting from the bottom of cans gives the user aluminum poising so watch out. It doesn’t even need to be heated to get the poisoning.Yeah me too after the coffee lounge next to the pharmacy drilled holes in the spoons. Damn spoil sports. They charge enough to supply you a complimentary spoon. The last sentence is shocking.  0_e[deleted]I don't know - going away to get some personal/private time on your son's death's anniversary doesn't sound out of line to me. But of course you know them better than anyone here.I'm confused how there's anything wrong with that. Not like they chose that date to go to Vegas and party or somethingThey probably had already mourned for, and accepted his death way before it happened so as to be ready for it; it’s the easiest way for a parent to cope after giving up any hope of a change. I would think that when it did happen, soon afterwards, they’d  be somewhat relieved because from then on they no longer had to be reminded of the fact their son/daughter while alive, was going to be dead soon.Staying at the house would remind them to much of the son that they lost. The house and the neighborhood are full if his memories.

People grieve differently. Some folks must face raw emotion without an opiate crush.It's a jokei like to suck up water from the toilet at the library i go to before i catch the bus homeIf I'm IVing, I'm not worried about aluminum poisoning. Im sorry buddy. It sounds like your life is really hard and sad right now. It has to be super tough each day. Ill be thinking about you. [deleted]They must grieve at home God damnitThis is absolutely true—I’m an addict but it was a short run and I got clean so I hope my family didn’t have to mentally write me off to survive. They knew something was up but I never stole from them or hurt them in any direct way.

My younger brother (he is 31 now) has been virtually constantly drunk since he was 17 years old. I know that at a certain point in the madness I started to grieve his death because it seemed inevitable and there is just so much sorrow in doing that but in myself and for myself it was 100% necessary.

He’s currently waking up bleeding from his gums and other mucus membranes daily and refuses to see a doctor even when I, his brother, am a doctor and am telling him this is a serious problem, brother.I know but some people honestly probably think their family would be better off if they killed themselves.I could never bring myself to go that far... Done that a couple times! At least from the back tank anyway. Hell gotta have itNo, thats exactly how they got aluminum poisoning by shooting.

There are hundreds of reports like these:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16749550/

Be careful.Um boyo if I'm IVing I'm trying to get high and aluminum unfortunately isn't gonna get me turnt sooooooooooo


Just cuz I'm a junkie doesn't mean I don't know where my priorities are lmaoFuck it share away that’s deep stuff.I mean they weren’t wrong? You guys wer the assholes in that situation lol me and my girl use and I know I’m hurting my mom by using but I don’t pretend like she’s the dick when she’s fed up with me. I'm sorry for your loss. Just out of random curiosity, is your user name based off Juice WRLDs song?They should have locked you and the fiance out of the house and blocked all communication. The cops could watch the house during the beach vacation. You two needed no parental assistance hitting bottom.

Parents of addicts need not let their dreams be memes.I know I’m late to the party- but I’m really sorry to hear about your brother. I lost 4 different family members/friends over the last two years to heroin and alcohol. Honestly heroin is faster and you can accept that the end is close a lot easier-as awful as it sounds. Alcohol is long and drawn out and takes  years to peak into the truly awful final form. I hope you find peace in this situation. It’s not easy- but as you know he’s gotta want to change.Addiction has a way of surprising you.

Oh the places we'll go.i mean...theyre nice ass bathrooms. like, i would shit without lining the seat with 200 layers of toilet paperI think you misread. If I'm IVing. I don't care about getting aluminum poisoning. Where did I say I was getting high on ALUMINUM? SeletedThank you so much. Alcohol is definitely ‘the long goodbye’ compared to heroin.

I have peace with it, but at the same time I’m fiercely ready to help him (I have a legal conservatorship now to look after his interests when he cannot.)Well that’s silly. Harm reduction is the way to go. lol cracking me up ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I made my friend into a meme and now I'm finding him all over the internet in different memes, Content: , ups: 711, downs: 0I always look to see if the guy still has strings on his hoodie/sneakers �The east coast dope fiend lol.���This is literally a man at NA last night this is excellent lmao.  hope your friend enjoys his notoriety!Looks like he would have a thick boston accent and be really supportive in NA meetingsRob dyrdek looking assHa!  He does have that look. Reminds me of a guy I was in treatment with. He was really proud of this one:

Yo dog I used to take my needle and pull raindrops offa car windows for water. 

Of course ha had all the usual shit. Close calls with cops. Getting shot at in philly. Xanax and the most blazing fire you can put in your veins, dawg. Because he's part of the 
"Flat Bill Society" and this is entirely too accurate ���Looks like rob dyrdek Lmao goood shit.."No bro I was literally doing 4g a day bro" ....

3 days later...

"Fuck I got soooo high on suboxone I fuckin love that shit I was puking my brains out"Scumbag Steve in a way lolLet’s see some more memesThis is gold I laughed way too hard at this Honestly, I feel like at least a quarter of all dope fiends look like this, just maybe a bit skinnier lol. I can actually hear this picture talking. "yeah bro at my peak bro I was pushing like 3 thou blues out my basement bro."  "I was making like 10k a month at one point yo" "my bro was actually setting up a lab in my basement before I got popped bro it was gonna be lit" 

And my all time favorite  "Hey bro can I borrow a dollar for the vending machine I got you tomorrow yo." ���They still make Echo clothing? This wouldn't happen to be in Massachusetts would it??"Bro, bro.... you don't understand ...."I hope he’s proudHAHAHe’s also the guy who goes “anyone got a bogey” or anyone need those I got some oxy in the car ����LmaooooWord LOLWhen I see an ecko sweatshirt I think drug problemLmaoIs this the original meme?Lol went into rehab no strings on my timbs. They nurses there gave me twine to tie them up cuz they couldn't stand the sound of them draggingDude I bought dope from in college was always freaking out on his girlfriend.. .

"WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY SHOELACES?!?"Fuuuuck I have waaaayyyyyy to many hoodies without the strings nowCan you tell by the clothing?I think he’s from Jersey lolThis is a Seattle Mariners hat, isn't it? Which would make him likely from the West Coast if not atleast a fan of Seattle. But they typically look the same over here too. I usually hate stereotypes, but they are too often true.is it literally?The other ones say "dudes fresh outta prison always take pics like this" and "Dudes that host MTV always pose like this" lol Damn, I always wear a flat bill snap back, i hate im now a member of this society.I’m watching ridiculous thinking the same thing but in this case the ecko hoodie stays.On itThat's what say when I see Ecko shit. Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of taking the shoe laces lolLmao. I’m currently wearing Docs. They’re purple, but one of the laces is black — for this exact reason. (Hey. At least I cleaned up and found a replacement, at some point.)Yeah it’s a dead give away I’m on the west coast too. But people from the east coast come out there for rehab all the time. I actually have a friend from sober living who was from Maine. He had a similar grey ecko hoodie and always wore fitted caps.I can tell cuz of the way it is.Jersey dude would have more facial hair, earrings and probably a little bigger if he’s stayed clean enough to get the sobriety steroids flowing.Was gonna say, this is definitely the height of Kenso fashion. Eh, the location of a team is usually irrelevant, it's all about the outfit and colors matching IME. Hahahah no but looks exactly like a guy I saw bumming cigs outside NAThese kids don’t understand what words mean anymore. #facts #literally #imdyingTo be fair, he looks like a shitty Rob Dyrdek��oh thats funny loltbf,it is just one part of the mosaic that is the white boy dope fiend. You need baggy clothing and a hoodie as well, in many cases a very edged beard. Dunno how else to say it but the facial hair often has fucking corners.Eh, the hat is common to all men in their late 20s to mid 30s in the NY/NJ/PA/CT/MA area, whether they do drugs or not. Snap back is different than a fitted. To me, the fitted looks kinda douchey, I’m a SnapBack man myself, but also beanies and curved brim strap backs. Gotta have variety. RidiculousnessPh yeah hella more memesThey didn't take them. I lost them using them to tie off.They don't take your shoelaces in rehab lol i've used shoelaces/hoodie strings as a tie off & believe that's what u/push__ did as well  Junkies in mass all look exactly the same. Middle tier grown up wiggers with corny and lazily executed hip hop aesthetic and the nasally Boston weasel voices you thought only occurred in movies making a caricature of southie kehds

Bonus points for an always perfectly cropped chin straplmao i'm on the west coast and had a friend from sober living that was from Boston and wore Ecko hoodies and fitted caps all the time as wellFrom E. C. CAN confirm �Couldnt agree moreKensington and jersey fashion nothing alike, my friend. Lol literally will soon have a new definition You mean an even shittier Robby D. Dude is a scumb bag and a halfYeah damn auto correctAhhhhhhOhhhh it all makes sense now. I don’t think about that cuz I don’t tie off They take your laces and hoodie strings at the mental hospital. Lol yupI can confirm most detox centers will take your shoe laces especially if they also deal with mental health. But you don’t have to be suicidal they still take all your strings. I wouldn’t call it rehab it’s usually where you go before rehab.the lighting, the trees, the color of the guys hair and skin tone, all dead give aways that this man is barrie ontario canada His post implies Kenso is *in* NJ. Literally It already does...Yeah. It’s annoying. Why is my boy robby d such a scumbag thanks cap'n yupppLove the username lmaoHe fucked mini horse.  Thanks!Wait lol he fucked a miniature horse?

I roll into the ICU to find him on a Dilaudid drip with a button. Got to say I was super jealous…hhahahahhahhaaYup :( LolIts funny cuz its true. It's pathetic cuz its true. � I can't count the number of times I've legit wished for a terminal illness so I could live a couple months in a drug induced bliss til I peacefully drift away forevaaaaa. Omg I'm tapped.I feel personally targeted lmaoI actually got yelled at once for pushing the morphing button to much..lolReal shit  I always liked the 2hr breakthrough shots when the morphine drip didn't cut it. [deleted]I’ve considered stealing there bag and running. A close relative of mine gets perscribed name brand hydromorphone 4mg and gets like 200+ at a time. They have chronic pain and need them, and their insurance is so good they barely pay out of pocket for them. So I'm very jealous.

Every time I visit them (once or twice a month) I end up stealing 20-40 of them (I'm horrible I know). Which is what basically ended up getting me hooked on the things but ah wellWhen my dad was dying in hospice, they had me go fill a script for something that they rubbed on his forehead when he would wince or make any other facial expression, as he was more or less completely out of it from liver failure.  He couldn’t say if he was in pain.  I was super out of it because of the whole experience and I was actually clean at the time so I didn’t even look to see what it was.  Anyone have any idea what that stuff was?  The nurses made a huge deal out of it acting like it was the god of all opiates so I’m guessing some sort of roll on fent?  This was in February of 2008 if that helps.  Just curious if anyone knows what that shit was.  It worked super fast.  His eyes would be squished up and less than 5 minutes after putting it on he would be “relaxed” again.  Yo. All fuckin day I was just on a morhpine IV this Thursday. First experience with painkillers and it was kind of fun considering my situation My father-in-law in currently in the hospital with a tear in the lining of his heart and a broken hip. They are giving him 4 mgs of Dilaudid every few hours. I literally can't take my eyes off of the vials as they fill the syringe. I feel like I'm drooling. My heart beats faster and I want to run up to the ICU nurse, grab the syringe and run off and lock myself in the bathroom and slam it. It's like torture for me but at the same time I get off on watching him get injections. I know it's insane but I can't help myself. I'm jealous of a poor, broken, shell of a man. Lol I can definitely relate clear example of how insane dope/addiction will make you I had testicular torsion and got put on a fentanyl drip once with a button, nurses told me I spam clicked it and started hallucinating saying theres people tryna kill meNoLol yup! I’m always like, I wonder exactly HOW much they keep on that ambulance. 

Seriously what are we thinking? There's a scene in the wire we're bubbles tried to rob an ambulance for drugs and needlesWell when I had my car crash I know my aunt who had more serious injury than me got three full vials/shots of fentanyl and was still in pain... Not counting the shots given the previous three to five hours excavating her from the car (they had to saw off the van in half and take her out with the whole car seat.)hmmm I wonder why you never hear of junkies robbing ambulances?IV ativan? should I be shooting up my lorazepam?!?They got fent tooThat! Specialy when in WD'S.They gave me fentanyl when I rode in an ambulance. 1 of 2 micrograms I think. They also got IV valium in thdre. Had to have a seizure and ativan not work to get it thoCrazy how a substance can make you envy a seriously injured person and want to switch places with them, some powerful shit...I had a PCA dilaudid pump before, for an entire week. Good times I've felt the same exact way Everyone that knows me well enough to make decisions in the case of my incapacitation knows that I want to be euthanized by a slow morphine drip over the course of a day should all hope be lost. Life has so much to offer you. Just hang in there and wait and see :)Why? Those things are on a timer. Once you've had all you are allowed over a period of time, you are locked out until that period has passed. (Prevents accidental ~~euphoria~~ overdose.) You sure you were pressing the pain pump and not the nurse call??The mighty morphing button?just say fuck it and get some heroin tbhEspecially when you’re the kind of person who has tantrums and walks into traffic on purpose I started the same way only with oxy 15s and 20s from my grandpa and grandma so don't feel too bad lolprobably fentMaybe fentanyl? I'm not sure, not familiar with any topical opiates Junkie shit is what we be thinking �I've definitely thought about/planned on how to break into our small towns ambulances.

Only one or two locked doors away from i.v. blissYeah pain killers don’t really do anything except make you care less. When I got stabbed multiple times I already on 16mg Dilaudid IV and it hurt. Medics came and gave me another 2 shots of an unknown dosage. Then gave me two shots of fentanyl 50 mcg each. Still hurt. But what did help. Was ketamine. By god they gave me that IM and I was in another world with no pain. Cuz of jail.. and detoxing in county ain't no fun..I don't think you can shoot it up with just water, but don't quote me on that. I've had IV ativan many times in the ER. NiceYou *had* to have a seizure? Like, medically induced?I don’t even feel bad about, just wanna have a drip w a button...It was the best of times �https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bodkin_AdamsIn palliative care, it's common for the doses of benzos and opioids to be upped to help the person drift away faster and easier. It's not technically euthanasia, but it does make it happen faster. That’s what I was guessing.  I have had the patches before and they take a good long while to kick in.  I haven’t ever applied the gel directly to the skin to see onset time.  But I would imagine it’s way faster.  Yeah I’m guessing that’s what it was.  Probably the liquid gel without a barrier like the patches have.  I’m not sure though.   The black hole. I visit that place from time to time. 

Ketamine is such a weird substance my god...doesnt stop most people tho from all other wreckless shit.No like I wouldn't have been able to get the IV valium if I didn't have a seizure. I was begging for a benzo bc I could feel a seizure coming on but they didn't listen and sure enough I had one When season 7 of Three's Company is hilarious at 4am despite the broken vertebrae, ribs and stomach injections.. there's probably a blue button involved. It's not Bodkin Adams so much as Harold Shipman who put an end to UK doctors free and easy use of opiates.
Its taken 20 years, but even the old private London clinics where you could get pretty much whatever you desired so long as you could pay, are finally biting the dust, because almost every dose and script of anything good is now tracked and traced.
Ah, for the days when doctors used to toss rohypnol scripts out of their third floor Baker St. window cos the secretary was at lunch and they couldnt be bothered to let you in themself.If I make it to that age, that'll be me. I’ve been K Holed 3x. Twice from the hospital when I was in four points and they wanted to calm me down. They gave me 3 shots and I fought them as hard as I can till they busted out the ketamine. I had a pretty decent benzo tolerance so they
Couldn’t get me with the Ativan. When they busted out the zyprexa I thought I had it. I was fighting so hard to stay awake then they busted out the K. Then the first time was the medics. Not so enjoyable for me. Oh, my bad. Guess I totally misread it. Are you epileptic?Blue buttons are my favorite �A shame.When people take too much on parties they do the same, they try to fight the feeling. 
You cant.
Just let it be and disconect from your body and ego. There is no way to feel fear once into the K Hole if you go as far as dead of your ego. I take it as a travel into myself.Similar experience, I didn't have my keppra for about 3 days and the right side of my body began locking up and I sounded like a fish. The started a line in the ambulance but couldn't give me any midazolam because I wasn't in a full seizure. Was an absolutely terrible ride to the hospital. Once I got there, the dumbass doxtor wanted to give me BENADRYL at first. Nevermind that I'm allergic to it, but why in the hell would you give someone that is obviously having a pseudo seizure benadryl, of all things? Someone changed her mind though and they gave me 2mg of ativan and it stopped in 30 seconds. Wish I had gotten the midazolam instead. Man that stuff is very euphoric.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Hate when this happens, Content: , ups: 705, downs: 0LmaoooI have terrible insomnia. When I actually do sleep, it’s like hibernation. I was in the hospital for a totally unrelated thing and I fell asleep after several restless nights (no one can sleep in the hospital) I dozed off. I was on a regimented pain med schedule at home. When some idiot decided i was “unresponsive” because I didn’t answer right away (I had earplugs in, too) I got my first and only Narcan shot. I thought I was dying. Can I shake you to make sure?[deleted]Damn it , Bobby!I knew I a dopehead near my old apartment in Baltimore that had a "please dont narcan" sign on him. Everyday he was napping on the neighbors trashcans. Fucking love thisA few years ago I was withdrawing from benzos and I had a seizure while I was outside. Someone called the ambulance and the stupid ass paramedic saw I had tracks well he narcaned me not knowing I was on methadone maintenance because he immediately thought I was overdosing on opiates when he saw tracks. I had them because I was banging ketamine a few days before. I was in the worst agony imaginable. I had already missed my dose that day because the benzo withdrawal was too much. Then the asshole Dr at the hospital wouldn't give me any methadone even though I missed that day and was narcaned. I felt like shit for a week until my dose stabilized again.Suboxone for the winWow that's rough. A month ago I fell out on a sidewalk in the evening. It was cold af and i was unresponsive for a long time but eventually the small crowd of ppl surrounding me were able to wake me momentarily. They asked if I was ok and offered me some bomb food. I said I'm ok then fell back out (while trying to eat lol) and woke up later and everything was closed and the ppl gone. Some1 had put a couple blankets on me and some ppl had apparently been dropping change (like $20 total) in a pile next to me. Anyway I'm stoned so I'm rambling but I think my point was how unfair the universe is that you had to go through that just bc your a heavy sleeper and I was strung out and fell out in public and they gave me some $ instead of narcaning me which I maybe needed. But this did occur in the Mexican part of the hood and yes I did buy more drugs with the money they left me. Crazy times.WOW that’s some next next level incompetence right there. I know this is absurd but anyone that does that should be forced to take a fat dose of opioids and then promptly narcan’d themselves. HOW DOES IT FEEL U DUMB CUNT?? lolDon't people check for breathing or pulse before doing something like that? I mean, as long as someone is breathing rather normally (and has a heartbeat), everything's fine to me. At least fine as in "just keep an eye on him".not as terrible as dying Jesus, dude. Have you learned to handle your shit a little better since this incident? ��Quit being homeless, OpiLobster. It sounds dangerous to sleep on a sidewalk all sedated. You risk getting raped or robbed.  :-(I remember you!  How's life dude?  You quit scaring the Mexican abuelas?  Srs though Mexicans want no trouble so you're safe from miss 911 trigger finger.Wow dude. JJ was certainly there for you. That could have turned out a *lot* worse. Tell me about it. Since I had been on a long time pain med regiment, the Narcan hit me so hard. I pulled that gross hospital bed cover over my head and waited to die. The pain and nausea were completely overwhelming. I was too sick to bitch about it but, my personal doctors on staff at the hospital gave the first year resident, that ordered the Narcan shot, several new defecation portals. [deleted]He’s prolly napping on the sidewalk so he can’t reply until he comes to. I'm not on the streets anymore lol.I'm good now. I quit dope and am on my way to having a normalish life. I moved away from where I was and moved in with a friend. oh, same. i’ve been narcan’d once before (imo i didn’t really need it, i was just in a deep nod), but then again i’m not sure we ever *really* think we need it lol. in my experience, it wasn’t as severe as the self-induced precipitated withdrawl symptoms i brought upon myself after injecting opiates whilst still having too much suboxone in my system. both are extremely unpleasant, yet bearable. Been off dope for a month now. Have decent place to live but if I relapse I'll be right back bc I have to push shit to the limit I cant just do a lilOk cool!

No more sleeping on the sidewalk.

*giving you two thumbs up*
Oh thats good to hear.  Congrats.[deleted]Yea that’s how it works for most of us man even tho we’ll do so well then for some fucked up reason trick ourselves that we can control our use and moderate it somehow haha. Sometimes but it always gets out of hand sooner or later. Glad you’re doing well now it’s not easy. The struggle is real.  I remember when you posted that story a while back, glad you're doing OK man. It's not like I meant to sleep there. I've fallen out a lot of weird places but I've been using a long time. This was the worst though bc there were so many ppl who passed by. I also once woke up on the floor of a Wendy's bathroom from a fent hot spot. Every time I wake up like that I think "wtf lobster why would you go to sleep here, hope no one saw" then I put it together and think "wow I could've died".excellent choice, honestly, i couldn’t be more proud of a stranger ❤️I had to ghost everyone and move to another state to get off dope. Shits insane.Doing soooooo much better now. I look and feel like a different person already. Ty.If you're homeless, just buy a homeI did. Took me a while to figure that out tho. I just kept forgetting what they were called so it took me a while. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Sad but true, Content: , ups: 702, downs: 0I’ll do these in loving memory of gmaI wish I had grandparents so they could die again and leave me pills lmao That's terrible jkI found a bottle 2 years ago in my dads storage. I was helping him move and I came across my stepmothers box of medications. She died from cancer in 99 or 00.   
She was prescribed 5 80s in the morning and 5 80s in the evening. I already know everyone is going to call me a liar. I wish I kept the bottle. I grabbed the bottle and when I got alone later that night I counted them. There was 1 oc80 missing. The bottle contained 299 OC 80s. 

I about had a heart attack. I was 2 weeks out of rehab, clean from a bad tar habit. This bottle scared me, I didn’t want to die. I couldn’t resist I ended up selling about 20 of them for $1 a mg, sharing about 50 of them with friends and I did the rest. These pills were sitting in storage for years in Seattle so they never got too hot or too cold, but the potency went down hill. 

The bottle was dated 1999 and if I remember correctly it had a 2002-2003 expiration date. I went back to the box a couple weeks later to see what else I could find and got about 20 100mcg fent patches, and 2 bottles of liquid oxycodone. It was a hell of a haul. The last time I looked the only thing left was a huge bottle of propoxapine aka darvocet. It’s a bottle of at least 500. Dude if that happened.... I'd pray to nt grandma everynight thanking her. Yes I relapsed. I spent about a week and a half helping my dad move. It took 3 days of daily use and I was starting to get sick. Out of the 299 oc80s I had approximately 200 of them in 4 weeks or maybe 3 and a half weeks. 3 days before I ran out I made an appointment with a suboxone dr. I had a relatively easy transition that time.Even in death Grammy stays leaving me treats �Lol i just farted i laughed so hard. I haven’t seen one of these since like 2005 (when I switched to bigger and better things) We used to call them jams when I was in high school lol 

-addict in recovery Y’all imma about to start doing voluntary in home hospice care. Cleaning old people houses and shit. Only touching things that expired years ago, swear. 
Best part is I have the look and old dudes in particular just enjoy having me talk to them XDThat would indeed be a miracle I’m not this lucky Man, I've never even seen an oxy 80. I thought they were an urban legend...My cousin got busted with 4,000 of these and 2 loaded pistols. 13 years Fed time.

Man, FL was the place to live in the 2000s. These were $35 a piece all day long. 40s were $20 and Roxy 30s for $10. OCxsz bless !do they still work? I remember watching my dad pour morphine syrup into cat litter when my grandma passed away. 

I was a teen at the time so watching them pour out a handle of her vodka was more painful but I didn’t know shit back then.The darvocet is still in the box. I didn’t touch them because it was recalled by the FDA years ago and if I remember correctly it’s like hydrocodone, it has acetaminophen in it. I told one of my buddies about them and he said he would take 100 of them if they were cheap cheap. Like .50 cents a piece.

Yes $80 a pill is a good price in the US for an OC80. Some will spend $2 to $3 a mg if curious or sick enough.Back when I was using, I had a service job. I got called out to this guys place and while I was doing the work he tells me, hey my mom just passed recently, I’ve got a bunch of her stuff downstairs I need to get rid of, take anything you want. Well, of course I go right to the medicine cabinet, I got about 50 oxy 5s, two full bottles of codiene and a brand new script of norcos. The other stuff was only a couple years expired so still pretty good. Man I feel sorry for my grandma... she’s allergic to codeine and thus most painkillers...Better say OC and not OP on the other side lol. ��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️�‍♂️��‍♂️


Funny if pope knew about opiates and someone hands him an OP and he’s like NOGETMEAN OC ONLY,’. I might bless an ABG 80 since it’s the sane difference.

OP 80 the pope screams “blastphomy blastphomy” “NO OPs!!!!!!!!!!!’nDude you could sell oxy OC80s is over here for like 160 or whatever you want name your price basically because they’re extinct they are like dinosaurs


He’ll have seen 30s go for $45-50 (middles ofc) but still I know people that would prob pay 2 hundo for an OC80 just to remember 

We smoked them up here and called them @beans” I stole over 100 OC 60s from my mom they were red but I smoked like 10 a day that week lol still feel horrible bc she had to use over $5k in cash and the asshole wouldn’t lower from $80 knowing it was for my mom and she really needed them bc she was scripted 360mg a day, fucker and he was supposed to be my “best friend” dealing for like 3 weeks went to his head God i miss the drainage taste of the old oxy 80s so bad. I have dreams about them all the time. Edited.Its even more terrible that i can say tbat and  not be joking!Hahaaaaaa brilliant, you deserve some gold but I’m poorI am going STRAIGHT to hell for laughing at this!Wow talk about a gold mine lolDaaaaaaaamn so 17 year old oxys. I mean you kinda HAVE to relapse with a find like that!

P.S. - Did you get withdrawals after doing the 50? I ask bc you said the potency went hella down so maybe withdrawals went hella down too lol idk? #junkiethoughtsI 100% believe this because I took a job in college cleaning out the basement of an office building which my friend’s dad had made available for storage for some church charity.  I found a motherlode of prescriptions in a box donated to a ‘medical’ missionary organization (it would have been super illegal for them to give this stuff out) which included at least 300 tablets of various painkillers and - legit, seriously, I doubt I will ever see this again - a 500ml bottle of *opium tincture* meant to treat diarrhea.  I wasn’t in full-blown junkie mode at the time so I foolishly shared a ton of this stuff with friends but Jesus Christ it was amazing to get a windfall like that.  I’m glad someone else got to taste the joy I experienced, or rather, that I got to enjoy a shade of the joy OP experienced.Jesus Christ... I’ve never had the pleasure of an OC80, or even an OP80 for that matter.. :( also, did you take any of the Darvocet? I came across like 20 propoxyphene pills a long time ago but they didn’t do much for me at all, they were very disappointing.. I’m just curious to hear someone else’s opinion on them since they’re relatively rare and not talked about anymore now that they’re discontinued in the statesSold them for $80 per OC80? People will pay that much?[Never has this meme been more relevant.](https://i.imgur.com/BKxhiU0.jpg)Hell yeah brotherAny chance you’re from CT? We called them jams here as well. Haven’t heard that anywhere else.Careful, most in home hospice places will press charges seeing as they consider all medications their property, not the patientsWhy do they enjoy talking to you?Yea you got the look. Nice hooters and cute face. You kind of look like Emilia Clarke.Thanks bro haha We'll all be joining you lolShe/he shared 50 with friends, sold 20, and did the rest. So they did about 229. I would assume that would come with a w/d. Haha. The interesting thing is that laudanum (opium+ethanol tincture) is still technically able to be prescribed by doctors in the US. Granted the DEA can set production quotas and probably set them to 0. But it's still technically possible I suppose.Until recently in the UK you could buy opium tincture or morphine solution OTC for diarrhoea. The concentration was low but still, I was buying OTC morphine just a few years ago.

Technically they're still legal to sell but wholesalers refuse to supply pharmacies with them anymore so I think production has stopped.I’ve had darvocet found some in my half sisters grandpas basement took about 10 of them lol, didn’t CWE or anything I was scared about the Tylenol but I didn’t give a fuck I wanted to get high. Felt like hydros basically they gave me a pretty good buzz even though I was doing a lot of dope and subs at the time. Yeah, Have you been living under a rock? Lol why do you think we have 90 percent heroin addicts on here? I remember paying 20-30 a pill back in ‘05. Then the doctors stopped prescribing them and everyone turned to D-block.It's crazy innit but it's supply and demand. They don't make them in the US anymore and they're super popular.

I pay £10 for an OC80 in the UK because oxy is an obscure drug here and not many people even know what it is. Boston. Close enough though.Eh I wouldn’t be joining a company. A lot of older people just hire person to person to have someone help around the house and with a few other things. I probably won’t wind up doing it anyway.Ah they’re old flirts. Harmless though. Lmao thanks XDwow wow wow


$80 for one single tablet or pill is RIDICULOUS. The high will last how many hours? It is not even an extended release formula. Costs over $10/hour of pleasure. 


FUCK 


THATI hear ya.. Just keep in mind, whoever you are to the patient, the medications often belong to the home care company as far as they and the law are concerned. Been down that road myself as well as a friend who took from grandpa, and grandpa said he didn't care, that he gave them to her. She still got felonies for it. Feel free to dm me some nudes lmfao jk
Exactly. Buy heroin instead you get way more bang for your buck, it’s easier to find, and there’s a limitless supply of it. Live clean and opiate-free, rather.Yes. A heroin addiction is unsustainable. I relapsed after 2 years off dope when I got surgery last month. I was on suboxone and that made the meds the docs gave me entirely ineffective. So I did dope for a month during the worst of the pain and quit almost two weeks ago and got back on my subs. 2 weeks clean Friday. :) Good going! Take your time recovering from surgery. Do not try to rush it. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Funny, Content: , ups: 695, downs: 0Hahahahaha now this meme is funny. I thought the bottom was going to say " what u need?"Lol.

Which exports sarcasmI know I was kidding. I dk why I got 12 down votes. I was just saying how crazy stereotypes are embedded in us and we dont even mean any harm or realize them. Everybody has them and runs into them. It isn't just to one race obviously either. Each sees the other, with certain stereotypes, engrained into us by culture without even noticing.I've personally only known addicts who sold to provide their habit. I've never had a Latino plug either. I don't live neat a major Latino community region tho.  By this comment, I'm not implying, insinuating, suggesting, or saying anything derogatory about black people.  I'm just stating my personal experiences.  They've all been at least half black.  They come from all levels of society and reside in all levels of living areas/housing levels.  

I chalk it up to them keeping the supplier in the family. As to spread the profits around the people close to them. I know for certain some areas have barely any job opportunities and people travel 30 to 40 minutes just to get restaurant jobs.  The bus line doesn't run far out enough to suburbs with the jobs,they need. The ones that do run 5 am and head back at 7 pm. Mon to Fri.  Thr Other buses that are similar are:  mon wed Fri or tues thur sat... 

This city makes having a car A necessity to earn a living. Insurance doesn't transfer and each person needs a policy. So one person with a policy doesn't cover, the family car. 

The bus is 3.50 to get on and 7 for a day pass, 280 a month. 2400 for a yearly pass.  Everywhere you go garages are 15 to 20 for the day.  Meter officers come every 2 hours. They ticket you even sitting in the spot waiting for food you ordered. The minimum is 2 dollars on the meter and it doesn't take cash any more.

the computer signals when time expires or a car has sat over the designated limit. Tickets are 120. News report said 37% of our county's inmate location is in there for unpaid tickets.  Picked up clueless of the warrant,  then they are  brought in on a warrant they didn't kno about. 

 I had a ticket too and never got the papers to inform me.   2 weeks after my warrant was issued, I got my notice to show up go court to have the trial concerning the ticket( which they issue a warrant if u don't show)....
They treated me awful and a burglar because I said I didn't even get the notice. All 3 came in the next month, but they don't care.

 This is the norm.  They charge you a fee for this too. Then they charge you a fee for paying online( 8 bucks) 
Of course course they won't take payment at the court. ( payment is an Indian call center too so that fee isn't even sustaining a local job)


Finally, construction zones are set up on every major hi way for 15 miles around and in the city. They have 3 major on Ramps and exits closed since march with no work since.  Speed limit is 45 and although 75% of the areas haven't had any work done since they laid out the cones, its triple the fee from construction zone. Mine was 70 in a 45. The flashing active zone wasnt on, no one has touched the road and it was 3 am. I got 4 points and a fine of 780.


All of us  are getting raped by city and state. This shit makes it near impossible to finance a car, in a city, where it's a necessity, to earn a living.

So I don't blame people who had all the cards stacked against them for dealing. This shit makes me disgusted. I pay enough taxes and our country is going to help despite them. Greedy savagesI like you ice.  You're cool like your handle. What did you expect? Lol never much of an in between there.lol you didLmao. Checks out. WisconsinIdahoYep.

A little ironic, dont you think? Its like rain... On your wedding day. It's like 22 tampons when all you need is to shart.SHITTTT WHITE!Eh ya I defly raved. I just totally see why so many black people in that situation decide to deal.  when You face all those things working against you, seems much more undrtstandableThanksThere isnt lol, unless they are from Milwaukee, otherwise WI is all farms and rednecksI lived there for 5 years. Cold copping there sucks! Chicago is where uts atNorth Dakota.ehHaha nah I hear you man. It's not as simple as people make it out to be. Everyone's just always like get a fucking real job. But depending where you live, your background, past, situation it's just not than simple man...Maine <3I hate that phrase. Get a job. I wish it was that simple. I’m lucky enough that I don’t have any criminal offenses and still have trouble finding a job. Days are spent filling out applications for nothing, so I just give up until I get filled with enough anxiety to motivate myself. I’ve got a job now but for how much longer might be in question. 

Not having a car is also terrible. The bus is a daily cost that adds up and might not always run or reach where I need to go. It’s rough. Some days I really just want to give up and start using again, see how long it takes before I get fired and fuck my grades up. It’s just hard to see a point to all this struggle and worry, even though I know drugs will not fuffill me YupSounds a lot like myself, I can tell you're not a stupid person though so you'll figure it out.

Right?

Or is it?Creeps? That bitch is upon you and cripped your shit up hard and you don't even know it!! My wife works with a lady that thinks she isn't an addict because she takes what the doctor has prescribed to her for the past TEN YEARS!! 10/15s a DAY!! LMAO The clouds are the opioids? ⛅️ or the blue sky? You always think “I can just do it a couple times and I ‘lol be fineeeee, I won’t have to have withdrawals” and then a couple times turns into weeks (or even months) on end lol next thing you know, you can’t find anything for the first time in 10 weeks and you wake up in bed after about ZERO hours of sleep, sweaty and shaky, and at first you don’t know what’s wrong. Then you have that moment of “oh yeah, I forgot, I’ve been doing pills every day for 10 weeks” and just like that, it’s “get clean” time again I feel like I’m being hard targeted here lolSo. Fucking. Accurate. That’s why I set a hard limit of once a month. Take them Oxys like their holier blood of ChristTruthLmaoooo This is one of the most real posts I've seen here. It's an interesting question. At what point does it go from casual drug use to an addiction? In retrospect I feel like I got addicted within ten or twenty uses but that actually took years to accrue.DeepYeah my binges aren't anything to worry about. I stop when I run out I mean when I want and get sick for unrelated reasons, always some bullshit flu or stomach bug. Definitely nothing wrong with that.Only when she's abruptly cut off will she understand. I always wonder how people stay with heads buried in the sand like this in the game lolSnag her script and ask her how's she's feeling the next day lolThe mirror, bro. Objects are closer than they appear....Couldn't have said it better myself! I bet most people here can relate ��IMO the very moment I did something I would see as reprehensible before ie. stealing old pills from family's medicine cabinets is when it crossed a certain line imo. But where did it begin....? Who knows I mean even before drugs I remember having an addictive personality towards ANYTHING especially adrenaline things. I remember two things I was really into as a kid was rollercoasters and as a teenager paintball. And I would be like obsessed with that rush way before I knew what a rush was.Physical dependency would be when you experience flu-like symptoms when you stop using. Perhaps the best characterization I've ever heard is a drug counselor in a documentary saying that "addiction isn't about the drug as much as it is about what the drug does to your life." When drug use adversely impacts your personal finances, relationships, and mental health, then it becomes a "real" addiction imhoI think it's also very subjective and also a process that takes some time. So it's hard to find a specific point. That's her issue she doesn't get cutoff and idk how some people get scripts like this and for so long!??? She walks, talks, no cane, etc... I couldn't ever get a single benzo prescribed let alone anything over a 10mg perc.True fucking story. It happens fast too. I have serious neck/back and connective tissue problems, yet it’s been 7 mos. since my doc hung his coat up and said, “fuck the gov’t and they regs.” Being 30 yrs old doesn’t help. 

Folks if youre getting a script, fucked physically or not, set shit aside; even if you gotta lock it up somewhere. Ya wish I could!! I asked my wife wtf she says is wrong with her and she claims some fucking B's neck injury and something else. It's funny because I asked the wife to show me a picture of her the other week and she isn't a bad looking ladyAhh makes sense. Sorry, currently pretty high. ��Exactly. At some point you find yourself doing something that you would ordinarily consider to be dubious. That is a depressing and sobering moment. We get through it with the help of the opiods and we're well on our way to an addiction.Never even got a 5mg perc in 34 years.  Never came close to getting benzos either That’s so strange to me. All I told my doc was that I wasn’t sleeping well and that I’m stressed out (this was back during college) and he prescribed me Xanax right off the cuff, it seemed like he didn’t even have to think about it. [deleted]But also got the same thing for a pulled tooth! Idk how one relates to the other with prescribing the same thing!??? Broken bones hurt a hell of a lot more then having a tooth pulled. Dude I had a major anxiety attack, went to the ER and they just stuck me in a room for 30mins, came back and said are you better now? See ya later!Only thing I've had percs for was broken bones.Ya I know some peeps that have horrible addiction issues and they have a doctor prescribe them bars!?? Someone posted on r/opiates the other day with there scripts and they get 200 dillies and 225 30s!! And dude said that's cut down from what he originally was prescribed!! I don't get it Was this in a college town? Where I'm at they hand out Xanax and Adderall like its candy.I got prescribed 0.5mg clonazepam x2 daily without a problem for a couple panic attacks I had. Yeah, today was my 3 weekly appt with my GP for my OxyContin script & I took a quarter of a pill to constrict my pupils as usual, but I didn’t quite cut it properly so I ended up taking more like 1/3 of an 80mg and less like 1/4. 

So the 25-30mg has had me spaced out for like the last 12 hours or so & feeling nauseous. But it’s finally wearing off now thank God. 

That extra 5-10mg over what I normally take prior to my appointment, really made a difference. I don’t like this feeling at all. Damn my er gave me a valium at least, jesusWish I felt how U felt when on opiates Ohh I was SUPER BUGGING OUT! I couldn't breath and all the muscles in my face got super tight and was stuck in the O face looking stupid as fuck! Almost had her pull over and call 911!Nauseous or high? High, Hahaha definitely not the nausea Random question here... I only use once or twice a week max - is it normal that I can take doses of 60 to even 80mg and can tolerate it?

Is having a natural tolerance to opiates even possible? Confused as why I have such a high tolerance when I don’t use every day. 

Ps, I get blister packed oxy so I know it’s legitI believe with just like everything else, your body is used to it now. You don’t need to use everyday to develop a tolerance. Think of it like beer. Say you drink a six pack two nights a week, over time you’ll develop a tolerance and a six pack won’t really get you buzzed like it used to. There’s so many other variables as well. Health,weight,diet,
age, etc. The natural tolerance thing I’m not so sure on. I was reading something about how Ozzy Osbourne has a naturally high tolerance to drugs or something along those lines.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: AKA big ozone, Content: , ups: 684, downs: 0When u had the plug and everybody asked u to middle �‍♂️�Yo when I got my wisdom teeth out freshmen year of high school I got prescribed 20 10mgoxy/325mg acetamenofen an I sold half and felt like I was some school drug lord at that point��This made me LOL irl lmfao 

Thanks for the chuckle ��When I used to sell methadone 5s and 10s In HS... good timesthis is a quality memeThis made me cry, thank youwhen the photoshops so bad part of the original photo is still thereMy stepdad got 150 tylox back when they were still a thing. I was maybe 13. My ass would wait til they fell asleep and army crawl in their room and take like 40-50 of them. Pop 8 and have a fun night. Ahh the good ol daysLmao that’s how I felt when I started working my job a while ago there was a dude who couldn’t get anything for pain after an injury on the job except suboxone. I got him some trams and he acted like I was the plug. 

Ff to when I ran out of trams he would act all tweaky and bitch at me because I had no more. This is the funniest thing I've seen on this sub
LolBig ounce lil bitch I thought it said his name was. "Big Bounce" instead of " big Ounce" lolI have a photo with the same caption but different guy. Wonder which is the original, if either.https://i.imgur.com/lfcPB7m.jpgreal talk, even looked like him lol1QQDude when I got mine out I got a script of 5mg hydros then my mom bitched they weren’t helping so I got a script of 10mg hydros. 45 of em with two refills. I stayed loaded for a while. I got youWe've come full circle. First there was LOL ( laugh out loud), now we have to specify that we"re actually laughing out loud in real life. you can't LOL irc, it's only possible to LOL irl. Methadone is one of the few I didn’t ever try. How much does it compare to. I have the feeling it would rock someone without tolerance. Pretty damn risky. I could probably get by on 5mg every 12 hours. Ty ❤️Always a pleasureAhahahaha big sameI get 150 pills a month. How tf did he not find out? I’d probably kill someone, if they took my oxy. Thanks!Damnn that’d keep me solid for a nice 2-3 days. Solid score manYeah man 20mg any you’ll be high for a whole day maybe 2 for a beginner, not recommend for people w no tolerance for sure.Less of a rush than something like oxy or H but still pretty strong and it lasts for over 24 hours. First time you try it you’ll be strung the fuck out. doctors seem to have this idea that methadone doesn't have any recreational value, but it totally does. Takes a long time to start working but it feels like most opiates, except it lasts for a ridiculously long time.Methadone isn’t for beginners. You’d want to start at maybe 10mg. It has a nonlinear potency, that’s dependent on the dose. Fentanyl is safer to prescribe, than methadone. It's probably the most powerful opiate behind fentanyl. I take 5mg recreationally and I can feel that all day (I'm 80kg). I use it when I've got a lot of physical work because I can work like a donkey on that stuff. It's also a very economical drug, I buy it at 20p/mg. The problems are the same as any opiod, tolerance builds fast. You can't hit it every day or the dose rockets. The nice thing about methadone is that you can put it down and don't miss it. Because it's slow onset and long duration it doesn't produce the destructive impulse to take another hit and get a bit higher, like heroin for example. This is why it's useful for addicts.My mom took them as well. But he knew about that. So I just assumed he thought it was her and she thought it was him. The perfect crime lolThat many hydros in like 3 days?? Insane!Yeah the first time I took methadone I was in love. 40 mg and I was high for over 24 hours. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy made her pretty, Content: I love being high and being with you. I love the way your hair feels on my hands. I love kissing your lips. I love feeling your warmth. You dont judge me. I know you try to help me but im an addict. Girl im a fuck up.Why do you love me?

No i dont have back pain. No i didnt get it from a doctor, i got it from a dealer. Dont be afraid when i take a handful, i cant take just one baby, its called drug abuse for a reason..

I dont know. ..Are you sure you want to get high with me? This shit aint like weed. Itll knock you back and put you on your feet. Leave you grinding your teeth. And sweatin when theres no heat. Girl im a fuck up dont follow my lead.

If you miss one more class their going to drop you from your nursing program. Im not one to judge but, your tolerance is building quick. Last night you took more than me. You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Your getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

This is the fourth time i have to pick you up from a guys house. And even though were not together anymore i still tuck you in my bed when your sprung out. I make you eat so you can hide your ribs. I told you not to play with trains because they leave tracks. I watch you sleep and dry the sweat off your head even though its winter. I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone again as soon as theres light.

You use to have such a beautiful way of speaking. So intellectual, and from the heart. Deep conversations and ideas. Now im seeing foam come from your mouth. Youve only been out of the hospital for three days and you want more? Girl please stop. I love you so much. I want you to be sober again. Youre taking too much. If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , "its called drug abuse for a reason".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you. I told you i hate looking at you like this. You told me then dont look. I told you i love you. You smiled and told me, "boy im a fuck up dont follow my lead".

OP also posted this on r/drugs and someone made an amazing comment. just want to share so people see it here too.

>When I met my boyfriend, I was making 7.25 an hour and was only able to get about 20 hours weekly. He had just lost his job due to the restaurant he worked at closing. I hardly knew him, but I was in love with him.

He would always go out randomly throughout the day. I didn’t think much of it, he would bring back food or something for us to watch. His old phone would randomly send me his location and I would always see him in random parts throughout town.

When I asked him to come pick me up, he would be hours late. I never questioned it. I was happy to have him in my life.

One day he came back to his house, where he let me rest my head and to get away from my parents. He gave me my food and went into the bathroom. He would always go to the bathroom, I assumed he got carried away on his phone, I didn’t mind, I’m just understanding his habits.

A few hours later, we are deep into a movie, we decided to pause it, make some snacks before his roommates got home so we could lock ourselves in his room, my paradise. He went to the kitchen to make food and I went to the bathroom to wash my hands.

There is it. A little dissolved pill on a spoon. When I saw it, I gasped. While not knowing exactly what it was, I knew exactly what he was doing.

I take a deep breath and walk out to the kitchen and I just stand there and look at him. Trying not to cry. Piecing things together. I just stare at him. I realized why he was in different parts of town, why he had little bruises on his arms and neck. I knew.

He finally looks up at me with a plate of food while a big smile and I watched it slowly disappear as I stare.

A single tear rolls down my face. He knew that I knew. He starts to shake. Is this the end of our relationship? We fell so hard for each other so fast, but was it the drugs that made him love me? Was it the way he was on drugs what made me love him?

I walk over to him and I just hug him. I told him I knew, and that it’s okay.

We walked back to his bedroom and he explained to me everything.

Instead of leaving him, I decided to help him. It was hard. It was really fucking hard. I remember him selling pretty much everything just to get one little pill.

One night when he took me home after work, he started to cry. He didn’t want to go home alone and didn’t have any money to buy that little pill.

I had just gotten paid. 115 dollars for a whole week. I had to pay my parents rent, I had a phone bill, and my parents dont have the same dietary restrictions like I do, and made me buy all of my food.

But i couldn’t let him suffer. Not like that. Not on a night I can’t be with him at night. I gave him every fucking dollar I had in my wallet. I hated that I gave it to him, just encouraging his addiction. Tears are pouring out of our face. He knew I made a very little amount and couldn’t bring himself to take it.

I told him it would be okay, and not to worry about paying me back until he is back on his feet.

Addiction is a horrible thing. But, if you know someone struggling. Help them out. Figure out what you can do and don’t leave them alone until you know they are okay. It does get hard. It’s not easy. There was lying, and I know he stole money. But every time I caught him, I would stop him and let him know this isn’t forever. I was there for him. I even ended up moving in with him after 3 months so I could help him out even more.

He is now almost two years clean, we are living in our own little house, both making a good amount of money, and we are so happy. Every now and then he will take me into his arms and thank me for being there for him. He ended up paying me back and is constantly spoiling me with gifts and food.

If I left him, i would have never been in love like I am now and I don’t even want to think where my boyfriend would be.

I wish my parents could understand why I left them the way I did, I really hope they can forgive me. But god damn, do I love this man.
You should really look into creative writing as a side gig. This is really well written especially if you don't have any formal education in the field. Not saying you do or don't I don't know you obviously. But if you don't and you're writing like this you should really consider it. I can see this being read as an awesome spoken word poem. I looooove it !!!! Wow this made me tear up sounds like me an my ex. hope shes doing better. only she got me smoking crack and she took up my IV dope habit. after a decade of using i finally have 7 months clean. Shes still ripping and running. I told her to go get help, I can get you a bed. "you used for a decade, I've only started!" fuck.I don’t even have words... beautiful and horrible and true in too many ways Beautiful. My fav thing I've read on here in quite a while.  I am that girl. Made me sad how much I related to this story. I hope I feel beautiful again one day. This lifestyle makes you feel ugly on the inside as well as the outside.Well fucking done.

I don't dose out props often, but this was perfect in tone and direction.

If you ever want to collab I'm up for it.I just woke up and now I'm crying.. Beautiful Damn. :(Made me cry..Holy fuck I’m crying now. I never saw it from that perspective. I’ve always been the addict.Poignant and close enough to home to feel creepy.Yoooo. That's heavy as fuck. Thanks for sharing,  I feel honored to have been able to read that. holy shit dude, holy shitAs someone said above, I am that girl. My ex introduced opiates and cocaine and all kinds of sordid substances to me 17 years ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. I do ok for awhile, then binge again. I did finish nursing school, and I'm successful in that aspect. But in all reality I'm just a functioning addict, rock bottom is just a few pills away at all times. Thank you for this, it's beautiful and tragic, and makes me look at myself a little harder in the mirror.  I liked that second line, I've been clean for a long time and I caught myself taking two of my multivitamin 'because if one is good, two is always better'. Checked the bottle and its a once daily thing. I had a similar experience. My girl killed herself in 2011 tho.This hit a very sensitive spot. It reads very true. Great job!This is eloquent. Such a beauty. Thanks for sharing. Beautiful, and I can relate so much with your girlfriend in this. My girlfriend says I used to talk passionately and intellectually about everything, and now she calls me a dribbling, lost soulYou could turn this into a song, it has the meaning. Just needs someone to believe in it.This hit me right in the feels. This is a beautiful piece of writing. Don't stop writing and stay safe my friend.Damn does it go like that too. Getting someone you care about hooked on the same shit u do, watching it spiral every second down to the ground where u burry them. FuckThat was beautiful and sad. too trueGeez. This hits at my core. It was beautiful but hard to read knowing how true it is.I love the way you write, ok there are errors a grammar nazi will find but spirit is much more important and it is there. It all rings so true and I can totally relate to it all.Damn, that was beautiful.Amazing!!!! Wow beautiful and tragicMakes me sad man and can relate too well...Very good writing, well done sirthank you for this - please keep writing :(Wonderfully said... ✌�lived thisI love this. Sounds like my girl and she's sober. That hit me hard. It was painfully beautiful to read. Thank you. Holy fuck that made me cryWow Loved itWow! Fucking spot on.  Great read. I don’t do heroin and can’t really relate at all also hate readin stories usually but I read it all this is nice What happens when your love interest is with you on your drug binges?Im at work and openly tearing up.  Thank you for this This was beautiful OP.Wow.

I really loved this...Gave me goosebumps like when you hear a song that really hits you hard.

Keep writing and sharing, you have a beautiful way with words. <3Mods please unsticky this post!!!! It is too visceral. The first time I read it I was in public and I had to fight back tears so bad. It is an amazing piece of writing, but goddamn it cuts to the fucking core of me.Man, that was a super raw and deep piece of writing. And very well done, especially the way you used certain lines of dialogue to tie the beginning and end together. Two different addicts but the same excuses, the same justifications and delusions. 

I love the way it all comes full circle. For the sake of your art though, of course... it just gives your story a poetic quality. As for having lived it though you captured your pain very eloquently, and my heart aches so bad for you. 

This I not a situation I've personally been through, but for a real minute there it felt like I have. I can't imagine.

Keep your chin up man, and keep trying to be an example for her, as for yourself. I hope for both your sakes it ends well. In the mean time though please keep writing, it's not only therapeutic but you seem to possess a gift.When I read this Susy if “I just realized I’m poetic” pap, which is really nothing more than a Neiro-mos-fire, I get embarrassed because my kid brother is just like this only about anal sex apology prose.  tl;dr?WtfSame man. A lot of memories and a lot of regrets.

Holli, if you happen to be reading this, I love you and I'm sorry. I hope you're safe and I hope you're better now. I wish things could have gone differentlyWow that was really encouraging to read.Jesus christ i cried at the part where she decided to stay with him... thats how people should befuck. I'm right there with you.  i used to hear "im young...i want to experience everything "...FUCK NO YOU DON'T I especially liked “I told you not to play with trains they leave tracks”.
But whole thing was great.Never ends well8th grade creative writing LARPsome people just CAN'T appreciate artistic or soulful things, I reckon its a result of being inbredExactly, I wish people understood this before opening the box. Once that bitch is open, there ain't no closing it.Maybe inbred, maybe just a jerk. Who really cares? Let them be a jerk, hopefully they will come around. I don’t like to abandon anyone. This is artistic to you?If you think this is artistic you are more likely to be the inbred oneit has taken me more than half my life to escape. not actively using, but you better believe i still think about it, and often daydream of my days dancing with the devil. So basically everybody that doesnt have the same view or taste like you are jerks or inbred? Looks to me like you are the real jerk hereWhy do you think this? Just throwing out insults makes you a troll. What was your view? Oh yeah-wtf.
Go fuck yourselfI dont know if ur blind or just have little self insight, but i just wrote wtf. It was you who started spitting insults like inbred and jerk etc Calm down you little emotional loser That was my point, you just wrote “wtf” but didn’t or most likely can’t say why you don’t like what OP wrote. I’m done with you now, you are a boring troll.

I remember one thread in some forum where they used alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) to extract the stuff from the bud to IV it. It was said that it did have some effect, but it started a discussion about bioavailability and what would be better, some also throwing in that oils would maybe work etc. So yeah, smoking is probably way more efficient.I think he has 3 handswhoa calmateWelp, I know what I'm trying tonight � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: When you’re living your best life., Content: , ups: 664, downs: 0Fucking Chad with dope ass plugs and I’m the virgin cold copper God damn Chad taking all our junkie womenCoolest chad of allI have never seen this one!

Made this and posted it maybe about a year ago the first time. Changed the text and no here we are. 

Edit. Also only added watermark last night. That’s why previous post I’ve made of this was deleted. Whatever you say captain. Can’t say I really care about getting credit or I would of posted it on the account that are water marked. 
I reposted for fun not to try to claim credit for something that has probably been made by 20 people over the years. 

And for the tenth time just cause I wrote this does not mean someone else didn’t write the exact same thing and or similar ones.

Or ive been sober not in a row meme.There a ton, but ok. Of course it’s been reposted, but also not saying another person or multiple people didn’t make the exact same meme, most generic sentence to come out with that but can confirm I’ve made and posted (and other varieties not just drugs)this all over for years and on here over a year or so.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: one year down!, Content: , ups: 658, downs: 043k SHIT son, if that aint a reason i don't know what is (except ur health and wellbeing)

congratulations =)Congrats my dude ❤️️ Proud of u !!!

Almost 6 months for me, it's been tough af but I'm doing it somehowit glows in the dark, so you don't have to

..whatever the fuck that meansIt feels weird just experimenting with a drug for the first time when you know it will get out of hand in the future, and you will have a hard time stoppingCongrats dude. I remember what an important day my 1 year was.

I’m coming up on 3 years now (on may 8) and I found that I hit a pretty tough hump at 18 months but you can power through it.

Instead of getting high for the past 3 years, I bought a new car and a house. Before I used to have no money and now I don’t even live paycheck to paycheck. So happy for you!Awesome work. I'm only on day 81 clean off H, but one day I hope to hit that one year mark too like you. Congratulations. Huge accomplishment, such an inspiration!Congrats bro! Just hit my 9 months, keep going strong!!Wow, $43k saved! Do you feel that much richer? Or were you getting most of the money from a 'hustle'.What is this app?

Also, congrats!!!!! Im proud of you, stranger!Lol 40k saved cheersThat’s so amazing!!!! Congrats on saving ur money, ur wellbeing, and I guess living a healthier life!!!! Congratulations!  Keep it up, much love! �So you make that much momey to be able to spend 120 every day on dope? Not saying it's impossible but you'd have to make well over 100k a year if you are independentMajor bro. Cheers x What app is this? Congratulations by the way! Damn I should be there with you. My year would have been this Friday. But I relapsed about a month ago. ��☠Hell yes!  Congratulations!!!!Holy shit that’s a lot of money saved!! Not to mention your life, as well. LSweet ����[deleted]Well done man. Keep it up Wow you're a fucking beast and an inspiration!!
oh well aren't you just mister purrrrrfffecctYeah imagine all the dope you could buy with 43K!




In all seriousness though, congrats OP hope you make that 1 into a 10!I hate to sound so cliché, but, it gets better! I'm not saying it's a breeze but it's easier now than it was at the 6 month mark for sure.  Hang in there bro.

edit: spelling[deleted]I always thought it was like lighting a pipe in the dark. Picture someone in an abando app you see is the glow from their lighterGet out while you can..Yeah, that’s more flirting with ruin than just experimenting.  You experiment with weed, acid, molly, shrooms, etc.  You get hooked with opes.

Rare people (VERY rare) do em occasionally and that’s all.  

Most get hooked, and there’s the 95% recidivism rate.  Shit even I know I could do better, I count it as 5 years because that’s when I got off the needle, but I’ve been tempted by pills from time to time.   I ultimately end up regretting it because once you’ve been there, tolerance and WD’s come in a matter of weeks.   That’s kept me alright.   I feel I’m lucky I’ve managed that though, and many don’t.

So yeah, listen to the other guy.  There’s no un-experiencing all the different opes.  And your body will never forget that chemical.   I think I’d trade back to never having experienced them, as then I’d be content always with the ups and downs of life.

And congrats to the OP.  One year means you’re a lot more likely to be successful, especially if you’re not on maintenance.  Not knocking that, but let’s face it, ppl on methadone aren’t really clean, they’ve just admitted defeat and settled.  Depressing shit. In my experience, the two hardest periods when getting off opiates is obviously the first 7 days, and then day 30-90. The latter is where you have to constantly fight off your mind trying to deceive you that you can do it again. Of course that doesn’t stop after 90 days, but I remember feeling like I was constantly hanging on by a thread for the first 3 months.

81 days is something to be proud of man, seriously. Keep fighting the good fight.81 days is amazing! Just keep doing what works. what app is that?Also, the amount of money saved is insane!Easy i used to spend 200 a day i was the junkie that makes people think twice about giving up $ first. Once u run outta people to burn u steal. Scheme anything for that fix.. if i had 400 id spend it may last 2 days but id buy 2 bricks at a time but quality wasnt great so doing 7-10 bag shots 6-7 times a day.. $$$ adds up Fast. Me and my boy calculated one day we figured dope gas and smokes we would need atleast 175 10 for gas 2 packs of smokes 150.for a brick. Towards the end we had a new guy who did bricks for 130. Or we could get fire fire shit for 90 a bundle but still needed 3 bags each foe that... but it didnt matter. We figured we spent 25000 on gas smokes n dope in 3 months..120 isnt that much tbh.... Its 30 a point in canada all the way up too Thanks buddy. It's called 'nomo sobriety clock'Remeber relapsing is okay! It's not the goal but never beat yourself up for it. you are human. We fuck up, alot, we are great at it. But you are still doing great and the next clean run will hopefully be even longer :) 
Keep at it and never give up! While humans fuck up we are also incredibly resilient and powerful beings when we need to be. 
Best of luck to you friend. Relapse is part of the road.  You didn’t lose your year, and thinking like that will continue rather than correct a mistake.  Just pick up, continue.  Subtract whatever run time you had and keep counting.  I don’t think anyone would ever give you shit directly at NA/AA, but if they did, ypu’d just tell em to fuck off and it’s your progress not theirs.

I think the mental thing of going to get the 24h chip etc. is retarded.  Stigmatizes it in a community built around the fact that it happens, making it like the walk of shame.  I don’t like 12 step, you may not either, but for those that do I feel like that is just a deterrant.  A good sponsor, imo, would give a year chip once cleaned up and the time was made up.  That’s what counts.  Keep moving, fuck up less and less over time.  If someone says they’ve never relapsed, they’re either 1 in a million or they’re lying.He's obviously not perfect. He's done heroin. But I even as a user that has no immediate plans to stop can appreciate and congratulate someone who does want to quit and takes the steps & fights the tough battle involved with abstaining from H. You can be happy for yourself and not post something like this but personally, I think showing other people who don't think it's possible, or those who are trying and feel like they won't be able to make it that far, is a great boost of confidence that may help someone else keep up their fight or get their head back into the game when they were so close to falling off the sober train. 

To OP: Grats dude. Keep up the good work. I’m guessing enough to last you 365 days lol 8 days for me! I'm hanging in there, I'm actually doing much better than I expected at this point.> it gets better

You’re not lying that’s a fact. ahhh.    lol all these meetings have different sayings.Thank you very much, made my day man. Thanks!NomoCongrats tho man. Are you on a maintenance like sub/ methadone? Or the shot? Or just 100% finally freeDamn 300 a gram?Would it also work for other categories (gaming, binging, gambling) or is it really specific for drugs?Thank you, yes, exactly the right message.i was just fucking aroundOh man. Late reply. But that made me laugh :pthats fucking awesome man, keep going

it really does get easier as you go. subs help immensely as well

wishing you the best of luck my friend <3

Definitely be proud, you made most of that key first 3 months.  Just remember the “pink cloud” effect and all, and be prepared that you might have an increase in depression or lethargy etc. as that initial happiness with being free wears off.  That’s the stage where boredom can hit and you can have the very wrong thought that hey it’s been a while, so why not enjoy a little but with the newly lowered tolerance.  Fighting that is a day at a time as they say.  But certainly a year is a big statistical milestone for long-term success, and understanding brain chemistry, you do better the longer it’s had to recover.

Gotta remember my own advice next time I’m at temptedNot to be confused with the nohomo appYup... The canadian police think a gram of H is worth 1000.. Last bust said street value was 1000... But its good dope too.. Brownstone Gotta lol at the question that would easily be answered a lot quicker by just looking up the name he gave you.

I’ll answer anyway though.  An addiction is an addiction, if you’re trying to cut something out, I see no reason why not use it, given you can name the vice.  I’m not even sure what about the app would possibly be so drug specific that very comparable addictions like gambling wouldn’t work just the same.

tldr; Well, yeah..Well it is the internet so technically that's to be expected but ya never really know who is or isn't so I felt the need to share. Maybe my comment will help someone else who really does feel that way. Cheers. �Thanks man I appreciate the good vibes . ~~~Lol they really said that? Police always look like such idiots when they say they found a half ounce of pot with a street value if 2 million dollars!Mainly because it says how much money you saved You could certainly quantify a loss for anything you mentioned.  Gambling is the most obvious, but either of the others causes a big loss of time.  One could value their time really however they’d like, although the most meaningful would be to correlate it to work (so hours saved not doing something multiplied by what you make, if on salary or self employed you’d just have to figure that out by doing the math versus someone paid hourly it’s pretty easy), so if i did less of whatever and more work, I’d make money.  Or it costs because your girlfriend gets pissed if you game all day, and eventually you get her stuff to make her less mad. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Whichever mod added the cute little "floating text" blurbs when you upvote a post..., Content: Maybe they've been there for a while now and I just never noticed, but...

Reminder for myself to check..It makes me want to upvote everyone. Upvotes for everyone!I figured a lot of this was Kicker, seeing as a lot has changed for the better since him being released from prison(?). Keep up the great work dude! I still haven't forgotten the shit (that I believe you worked on) in the past with the image flairs and whatnot lol. Thanks man, it's much appreciated. Hell, even the sidebar's 'submit a new link/new txt post' buttons look way better imou/kickerS12X that's what soberity is all about.

that upvote button[deleted].Let it be known here that I have stated: the mods of this sub are the best in the business and with the level of experience and excellence with which they wield their long arms of Justice they fulfill the promises of generations of rule enforcement officials that guide our modern realities!!!Does this work for reddit's new design? I haven't seen this.Just a reminder: onhover/onmouseover is a computer-only event. (for the buttons). Doesn't work on mobile.How did you learn to code for Reddit?

Is there a simple way to add custom JavaScript and images when you're a mod?Can we change the "I feel the love" to "I feel the klove?" Everything is better prefixed with a k, afterall. (One of the random messages upon ~~upvoting~~ smashing the like button)[deleted]does it work on mobile? I tried upvoting to see what would pop up but nothing didHahaha just got on the desktop site and hats off to you guys. Cracked me up 10/10just dont overdo itYo dawg I heard you like subs, so we'll give you subs while you take subs while you're already high on dope so you go into precipitated withdrawal./u/KickerS12X is the man!

Also  dont forget to not wreck yourself[SMASH THAT KLIKE KBUTTON](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7frn19/smash_that_like_button/)I stay busy as fuck with all the knuckleheads around here for sure!If you are on chrome you can click the three dots in the top right corner and hit 'request desktop site' and it will bring up the version we are seeing.lest we forget  :(just read this after I posted my questionIt's all CSS.

[Great resource.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)SSSMMMMAAAASSSSHHHHHHH*tips fedora*....M'lady\*does a curtsey\*Nope! Mobile app's don't support CSS changes.Too late. LOLLLLI probably need some subs :( I've lost control.fu fu fu fu fu fuck a case lil tayk did the raceWhen did you get back?I wish they showed up on the mobile app ��Thank you :-).Hehehehehehe <3.Mobile doesn't support the :hover css special. BUT, for anchor's ( the <a> tag, which the submit buttons are) there is a special property "active" which will occur after they click the button.

So you should be able to copy the :hover rule and change hover to :active, and folks on mobile will get the same effect after clicking the link. Since mobile is slower, they will see that yellow bar for probably a few seconds before the next page loads. � 

Let me know if this is unclear, if you're interested I can help you with specifics in PM.And clearly lost the race lolAbout a week ago as a mod, got out the joint about a month ago.Click on the 3 dots in the top right and select 'request desktop site'It works on the mobile browser, but not the apps.Oh, neat. I'm glad to hear it, though I thought you were being put away for years?Thanks. Good lookin’ out for when I’m bored and on the mobile app lol

Edit: ahh I know what you’re referring to but that option isn’t avail via the iPhone* app. I should’ve specified. How does a hover work if there's no mouse?I did 2.5 the first time and 2 the second time.No, you misheard him.

He wasn't put *away* for *years*,

He was putting *whey* in his *ears*.Err, I meant the floaty upvoties. I will take a look at the submit buttons.Yeah, I'm saying for the submit buttons you can take the code that's like 

.morelink:hover a

and copy it into a new stanza directly below that reads

.morelink a:active

But I might make a comeback on the last week of March when I finally have a license and money :3Ahh ok thanks guys*dope loanMe too dude I'm still fucking laughing We’d love to see ya back! And why is active bad? I love it because I always have people to talk to!Yea I would edit but that was a fuck up.  It was not auto-correct.  I guess my brain was thinking aesthetically.Bring it back make ya laugh again!Activity is great, but sometimes it's so active that it's hard to talk to people and by the time you get someone's response, 10 other messages for 5 different conversations have been posted. You were thinking phonetically, actually :PYes that too, but it looks better as 'one', for symmetric purposes that is.  Pattern like.You're killin' me smallsI getcha. Like when Audre Lorde dropped the y from her birth nameYes, exactly.  I didn't do that on purpose though, unfortunately, lol. nah you’re a poet haha @@@@@@@@@@ Title: He had a visit to the vet this morning and he gave him morphine. He's on another planet., Content: , ups: 648, downs: 0This is possible the best thing I have ever seen. Tell that doggo to SIT!
NOD!

Good boy.That's one doped up doggo!!I would’ve thought it’d have an opposite effect on his eyes. Them shits are wiiiide tf open lolYou guys, you guys, where's... the sour patch kids?It's when he wants to be let out to cold-cop that you need to start worrying. Saw this on another sub and thought it belongs here. Lol, I probably looked the same way the first time I injected morphine and got hit with the pins and needles! HAHAHA god i gotta post a video. My kitten was getting neutered, and he's pretty aggressive so they had me give him this sedative it was absolutely hilarious. It was like he was hammered. 

He also got ket at the vet, and I was pissed they didn't give him a baggie to bring home. i mean come on! he needs it! 

lol really tho, he was rolling around on the floor he was so zooted afterwards. Lmao! Is that a boarder collie? Dogs with that color of eyes always look neurotic haha but this is next level."Hey man, wanna buy some dog morphine?"

"Woof."Disturbing. I think they gave him Molly.can you please tell that dog that it's a good boy. I'm hope he doesn't have anything serious and that he can enjoy this and be ok.Pupils are pinned the fuck out lol[deleted]Interesting thing. When I worked at a vets office, when the animals would come out of the anesthesia, they would open their eyes really wide like this doggo. It was so funny! 

I recently took my cat in because she had hurt her leg. They gave her a script of liquid morphine and she would go to sleep, then wake up and do the huge eyeball thing. H I G H B O Y EDaaaaaamn that looks like an upper with those dilated pupils not morphine! Regardless, your dog is flying! LolHa, that dog is lit! That dog got better medical treatment then most humans do nowadays, lucky bastardLooks like Fido is rolling balls Sniffed or IV?That’s the best thing I ever saw!!!
-Fry��awhhh!!D O P E B O Y EHahahahah I just laughed out loud at this for like two minutes straight, thanks I wonder how dogs get when they go into opiate withdrawal. Do they pawn all their Scooby snacks? Just so everyone knows this dog took shrooms in the woods with its owner. You can YouTube it to fact check.Ah, a fellow creature having a grand old time having his/her mu receptors tickled.  

As humans, we need to get over ourselves -- just because we have couple more brain cells doesn't mean there's any fundamental difference between how our brain works vs., say, a squirrel's. Poor dude was hugging the wall so he wouldn't fall off the earth lmaoOmg love it!!! He looks like he's on acid or something tho lolRight? I can't help but giggle every time I see this. LolSame, it hurts too laugh!Yep.

Looks like doggo got an addy or a tiny bump of meth or something.dogs usually have bigger pupils though so maybe you can see more of his colored iris because his pupil is pinned compared to what it usually isWhen I first started with opiates they’d give me that lil boost of energy and chattiness, and they never made me nod out or get sleepy until like several hours after my dose. Maybe that’s what the puppy is feeling. And I’m jealous as shit, I much prefer the energy to the nodding but it stopped having that effect pretty quickHahaha, I just imagined the dog sitting at the door itching, or prentending to get hurt to go back to the vet to see the plug!ohh those pins and needles. never shot morphine but I've had some ecp that still had some morphine in it and gave me those pins and needles. fairly unpleasant the first time but I grew to appreciate it - it was decent stuff.OMG, you should definitely post it. 

& Ket is one thing I've never gotten a chance to do. It's on my bucket list though I think it is. And I know, right? That look on his face cracks me up every time I see it!Its an Australian Shepard, I have 2 of them. The native Americans used to call them ghost eyes.CATS ARE THE BEST YOU KNOW?! I FUCKING LOVE CATS..AND SQUIRRELS AND THE MAILMAN. THE MAILMAN IS SO FUCKING COOL AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MOLLY I SWEAR! I WISH HE WAS HERE SO I COULD HUG HIM AND JUMP ON HIM AND...AND...WHERE DID MY WATER BOWL GO? I'M REALLY THIRSTY. CAN YOU PET MY BELLY OMG THAT WOULD FEEL SO GOOD MAN THIS IS GOOD SHIT. Those pupils though. It's definitely an opiate. MDMA dilates pupils.According to the OP who took the video the doggo stepped on a nail and had to have surgery for it. Doggo is totally okay though apparently.I'm clean but I haven't unsubbed, and don't plan to. I love this place. I don't really go out of my way to look at the dope porn though lol. I mean I see the pics in my feed but I don't really open themI noticed the same thing when my cat got neutered. I wonder why that is?Haha, I did too when I saw it! Glad I could brighten your day! :)Hahaha, we've all been there :)He looks like he's already clucking!!! ....  Jesuz! Like the wheels are turning on whether it's worth snatching yr phone and being homeless! ffsVet was like

"ay to I'm gonna toss in a free point of this ice it's a new connect. Hmu if you need anything"Dogs obviously have some kind of consciousness, so I'm really curious what he's thinking / feeling (esp. since there's no way they could understand what drugs are).. like they def get anxiety and whatnot so I wonder if he's thinking "I have no idea what's going on but this is how I always wanna feel" .. in dogspeak tho � Same. But personally I love nodding. After a couple years of doing drugs all the time, and the health/lifestyle changes that come along with that, it's lovely to have a substance that'll just put me to sleep comfortably and isn't a benzo. If I need to feel chatty I have other options (coke, Phenibut, etc). If you have an oxycontin prescription and you stick rigidly to the prescription amount and eat the pills like you're supposed to then you get the energy/chatiness every time you take your dose, so every 12 hours.It freaked me out pretty bad each time. Idk I don't find the rush too pleasant either. But I also learned to appreciate itIt's definitely interesting. Dxm is very similar except won't put you in a temporary trippy coma like ket can. This is too real [deleted]Good question. I wonder if it’s a thing where they feel threatened and they are really trying hard to stay alert. “Dogspeak” fucking lel "Bark Bark Bark" "what's that girl? Lil Jimmy is trapped in the well?" (In dogs thoughts) no you ass hole just gimme some drugs. DXM is like Ketamine mixed with a lil schizophrenia imoRight, I totally understand that.  I'm on vivitrol so luckily I don't have awful cravings for dope, so the pics don't bother me really. But if I sit there and stare at them and romanticize using, it can get bad quick.

I want to go to thereIsn't this how most people think about drugs when they first start? And then it just becomes maintaining, instead of enjoying...... You just described Switzerland’s heroin clinics So basically Laos? You can live on $500/month dope included indefinitely there.If there's even a hell of such kind, I'm in!I’ll pop a xan and snort a line of China to that!!C'mere, brother!

*somewhere, a Jimmy Buffet fan gets their wings*Wouldn’t shock me. Also, birds get drunk on fruit. One time we saw them feasting at school, and they were flaying into the walls. Because with pot, you only need one plant. An acre of poppies yields 7-13lb of raw opium. So realistically, you'd plant maybe a 1/16 or 1/32 of an acre ?? Which would yield 11 or 22 ounces on he high end of cultivation yield. Just isn't worth the work. And thats before an attempt to acetylate it. Heroin has a 6-10% yield from the original weight of the raw opium. Which gives you 1-2oz of heroin, per 16th/32nd of an acre of poppies.You can buy them online with a simple google search. It's not illegal to grow opium poppies its illegal to use the goo.

I would say coca is much less common because it's a tropical plant. I had one while living in Costa Rica. It's fun to chew the leaves.You can buy seeds anywhere I’m growing some right now and poppy plants doesn’t transplant well at all both of them would takes many acres of the plants to make into a yearly supply for an addict. still, lots still do just thisr/druggardeningI believe the Coca genus is a tropical one so probably no luck in the US maybe southern Florida, Puerto Rico or USVI if you can manipulate growing conditions.

P. Somniferum is grown in backyards throughout the US. If you know what it looks like you will see it eventually.  Ive seen it grown in public parks for aesthetics although that was pre 2005.  The alkaloid content varies drastically though.  If you can get a high alkaloid producing strain you could increase output significantly.

As mentioned below it transplants poorly but can be done when the plants are very small but this will limit yield and oftentimes kill the plant. Sow seeds in late fall or early spring.  The seeds seem to need a period of cold to reach full potential.  Also you need quite a large area and lots of time and labor if you want anything more than a small personal amount.Don’t think you read the article at all lmao I laughed so hard seeing the little guy fly away with a whole pod and all the destroyed pods that were like half gone. Birds are such a trip man I love them. Be only good for 3 months or so, unless they have access to greenhouses!  Perhaps they stash pods somewhere?True but this article is actually great Sounds like you meant to post on whisper.Tedious and gross? What kind of sex are you having?Thinking of a dopesick parrot makes me sad :( 

At least they don’t have to have a bunch a hustles or have to pawn their mom’s jewelry to cop a fix Except you can't use as much as you want, can't take it home, can't have a job as you show up at the clinic a couple of times a day.... Nah the hell of that is you've got loads of money and the dudes phone always goes to voicemail, but on the chance you finally score its either bunk or just cut to shit with sugar. I mean, if I were to have a lil field of poppy plants then I’d say fuck refining it. Jus cook down the raw opium and smoke the opium. No, it doesn’t hit you like a shot but smoking opium will lay you out like any other. I personally love it. Wish I still had a source tbhIsn’t it a a very specific kind of poppy and it requires very specific conditions to grow ? 

I always liked poppies bc they are so punk rock. Like if you pick them they just fall apart and are like “haha. I’d rather die than get plucked and put in a vase bitch” If your growing personal amounts of opi you wouldn't need that many plants, but cocoa yeah you'd need a field at least because it's like 1% cocaine or somewhere roughly around there yeah... they're cool, but i get really frustrated with them in my veggie garden... they will eat every seed i throw down unless i put bird netting on all my beds (which i've done)!Just standard hetero sex. I just scroll through sex ads looking for drugs and I think “what is with these people? Drugs are way better.” To each their own I guessFr wtf I can understand liking drugs more but not actually disliking sex tf especially for a guy Thinking of dopesick people makes me more sadYour right, they  just gotta watchout for the Afghan with the shotgun.

When you compare their lives thinking in terms of consequences of getting burned based on ease of acquiring the dope I still think id be okay being a parrotOpium, albeit not as potent as most other opiates, imo is the best one you can do I first smoked opium back when I was sixteen and it was one of the best highs I’ve ever had ;)Yes, only papaver somniferum can be used to produce opium. Other kinds of poppy are just decorative. For example, in Germany (and I reckon the rest of Europe) the seeds of that kind are used for cooking and baking but are rigorously cleaned from any trace amount of opiate alkaloids after there have been some involuntary intoxications. Idk if you can use those seeds to plant poppys. But I know that if you order seeds that are meant for planting you can get in trouble w the law as a license is needed for growing that specific kind of poppy. Nope, and not really. They’re god damned weeds haha it doesnt take many plants to get high ONCE. were talking a yearly supply for a heroin addict lolI see your point here, but if the coca bush gets 10 ft high and the leaves contain around 0.5% cocaine.  Poppy straw is about the same when harvested about a 0.5% yield (different than extracting latex).  So the same yield from plant matter but im guessing a significantly greater yield per unit area because you are going to have significantly more weight on a 10ft high coca bush that is taking up 16 sqft of growing space than you will poppy straw in 16 sqft of growing space.  I have no real experiece with this it just seems logical but someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Thinking of Omar from the Wire makes me more sad. Best show ever. YerrrBecause opium has been found to have at least traces of all the good shit. Even hydro and oxy morphone So fresh and so clean But he's right, only papaver somniferum contains the good alkaloids. All the other kinds of poppys only look pretty but won't get you high. Fun fact: there were some poppys growing on the premises of the first hospital I detoxed in. But I don't know what kind as the pods haven't flowered yet by that time. For someone with that high of a tolerance yeah I'd def agree lol. That's why I stopped all my current opioid use ��I'd definitly say your spot on with that analysis, so over all it's more realistic to grow some poppies for slight personal use as opposed to cocoa for the samePoppies can be harvested multiple times though because all you need is the latex which is actually very high morphine content. You don’t need to kill the plant to harvest so the same plant can give you more again later down the road. I’ve known kids in high school that found some in someone’s garden and took the latex from a few and put it on top of a small bowl of chronic and smoked it to get high. They had zero opiate tolerance but still it’s possible to get something from a few plants, but the process of turning it into heroin means you will be getting less than the weight of the latex obviously. He'll yeah man, I tried it at a music festival last summer (after already having been addicted to every opiate under the sun in my life) and holy fuck dude, that shit is amazing It really is. It’s all the best shit rolled into one beautiful smoke seshI haven’t stumbled upon actual opium in years, but I have fond memories of it for sure. I love the smell of the smoke too. It’s very distinct I used to be good friends with a dude that owned a gas station in my town. He was Indian and would take frequent trips to him home country. He’d always being me back a 10 pack of biddie’s. Idk if I’m spelling it right. They’re joints that have been rubbed tf down with opium. Smoke one of those bad bois and your dick is in the dirt. Good memories @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I guess I remember having friends like this, Content: , ups: 637, downs: 0here's some really complex amusement though. take a long weekend by yourself, go out of your house friday morning and don't come back til monday night. the goal is to get as far (geographically) from the start point and get by with nothing in your pockets or your system. that shit is real fucking hard but when you get back home it's sublime. So true. People always so excited to get off work and drink a beer. And i just sit there wondering how does that get people excited. Give me some oxy and xanax and dope and then add some alchohol to intensify the effects then it sounds exciting! I wish i got excited over a stinkin beer� once u do opiods or oxy ext. Everything else  that used to be fun turns boring lol. Fuck it. Time to blow a 30 ;)[removed]Yes he was. I'm old enough to have seen Nirvana on MTV live. RIP Kurt. Hope he finally got that peace he was so desperately looking for.It is fucking pain. I remember the time when I didn't thought of opiates everytime I am slightly bored. Fuck, the worst part of taking drugs is that the normal life gets boring.This relates to me but not how you might think.  I ran the fun out of heroin and am now sober. This is more like “everyone is going out to drink but I can’t because I’ve got to be sober now”He had a vicious heroin addiction. That could explain why he was no longer passionate about music. When you go off opiates music sounds good for some reason. At least until horrible depression kicks inWhen I get offered a drink I usually turn it down while thinking of all the negatives that come with it. Yet I can't think of one negative when I am offered a pill or bag. Only after can I think I of one.On stims as well, good man Lol nice meme. Facto I was so high this morn/night I stood in front of my toilet for what seemed like hours before the damn finally let lose. RIP TO A LEGEND his scandalous girl made it a cover upI’d most likely get real high before leaving Friday morning and commit to driving 4+ hours away, saying to myself the farther I am the better ... and once I reach my destination I’ll get by ok I’m sure. Until I start to experience restless legs 13hrs in and I’ll hit up homeboy, speeding back home to meet him and pick up. And it’d be barely half a day as I get high again. And repeat. Spoken like someone who has never been thru actual opiate withdrawal. 

Have fun walking around your neighborhood disoriented as fuck switching from bus to train to bus to train, pan handling or turning yourself out or stealing shit and pawning it so you can afford a candy bar and a bottle of water that you don’t want but have to choke down so you don’t die of malnutrition or water loss from all the puking and diarrhea. 

Once you’ve managed to somehow mooch six or seven bucks to get something to eat, you’ll go in the restaurant covered in the spit of the “respectable” and smelling like you’d just ran a marathon. BO is so unbearable that you’ll offend everyone in your general vicinity. Everyone will give you dirty looks and your clothes will be ruined. At this point you’ll be far as fuck from your house, having snuck onto a few buses or trains to accomplish your goal of getting as geographically far as possible from your home. 

By the time you’ve convinced enough people to give you enough quarters and dimes to afford a couple of McChickens and a Big Gulp, your weekend will be over. Maybe you’ll get “lucky” and someone will give you money or drugs for sex (sex that may or may not be according to your preference/orientation, ie gay for pay or straight for pay) or you’ll steal something, but those two things probably won’t happen because withdrawal makes you look smell and act like a freak and a lot of ppl won’t want to get near you.

You’ll be lost, shaking like a damn leaf, exhausted from not sleeping for a whole weekend which you spent either outdoors or on public transit, horrible restless legs you’ll have to pound on with your fists to calm down, drenched in sweat to the point that your clothes feel like a wetsuit like you’re going surfing except it’s sweat and not ocean water, and if you did manage to score some dope while you were out with jack shit for money or drugs in your pockets however you might do it, then you either have to shoot up outdoors in a stairwell or in some public bathroom with a needle that couldn’t possibly be sterile because you’ve been outside for over 24 hours and everything to do with you including your skin is covered in germs by this point.

If that idea, taking a long ass trip to nowhere with no money or dope, sounds fun to you, you are not addicted to opiates yet and you should stop fucking with them now. Like right now. Everyone thinks they can handle joy popping until they can’t anymore. Nobody decides to get addicted to Heroin.

That sounds like hell on earth to me, and I’m pretty sure a lot of people who are homeless just live this lifestyle all the time. It sounds like you’re describing a weekend of abject poverty as a drifter. Like I said, if that sounds fun or complex or entertaining to you, you are not a junkie yet. A real junkie would be terrified of doing that and would probably avoid such an endeavor at significant cost, including stealing from family, friends, or allowing disgusting people to take sexual advantage of them.So true, I remember the days when I was excited to get off work and smoke some pot. Now I get excited to smoke some tar when I get off work or eat some oxy.heroin iv was my first opiate, i quit after 2 years and now i'm happy to smoke weed and that's it. just because you can't doesn't mean it's boring. i've had oxy too and compared to heroin, now that is boring.same position in a way in relation to alcohol. i still love smoking weed though. Shit, i remember when that sounded exciting. Nowadays, unless theres a spoon and rig involved  i feel like my time is being wasted, even with opiates.Right. I be smoking and sniffing h at work, excited to go home and do enough to Really nod, yes give me the booze but give me the dope on top of it tooo��Poor cobain :(so spot on, how normalcy (or sobriety) starts to feel boring after a period of time. god how i wish i could just un-try opiates, benzos, meth and basically any thing ive ever been addicted to. i mean ive even been addicted to removing  blackheads and stuff like exercise, i really do get addicted to fucking just anything its so dumb and a pain in the assI’m actually clean now too, I just thought this was funny. Honestly I consistently have more fun in recovery though the highs are not nearly as high the lows aren’t soul crushing anymore. In any case congrats on your recovery!you rly think he was murdered? don't get in a car that defeats the point, then you're just driving aimlessly away from your house like a loony. test your ability to survive at the bare minimumtHanKs fOr thE frIeNdly aDviCe pRoFesSoRSo perfectly said ��Damn you also forgot the part where not only do other people not want to have sex with you, you also don't want to have sex with anyone, let alone touch anyone, cause it hella fucks with your sex drive...Lil over the top there budId rather blow soke oxy than eat it but hey enjoy how you enjoyfor me it was dxm, never really liked weed but dxm was one of those things for me, i could just do it sometimes and i was fine being sober the rest of the time. i mean i was still chronically depressed as i have been my whole life but it wasnt particularly painful to be sober... now its extremely painful when the opiates/benzos wear off[deleted]I see what u mean makes sinceAlchohol doesnt even make you feel good in comparison to perks/roxis/opiates. It feels good when you drink a small amout of alchohol to intensify the opiates in me�☠�..anythijg to make it stronger. I sprinkle fentanyl on my mcdonalds fries  for funhe was def murderedThis would make sense of you lives at least 20-30km into the woods with no one around. I certainly did! I forgot to mention that any sex you will be having will be entirely non consensual but, paradoxically, you will be desperate to have it because you need money for a fix. There is no worse feeling than being desperate to find someone to buy your consent/pay to rape you so you can stop feeling horrible. That’s basically what low end prostitution is, I’m not trying to be judgmental of it, I was a gigolo myself for quite some time. It’s just hard. Being a high class escort is fun (sort of...), but if you’re just desperate and looking for any way to get money that you can from any one, being a hooker is a living hell disguised as a party. It’s very sad. 

The thought of even kissing someone whilst in withdrawal is absolutely sickening. The act is even worse and it just goes downhill the further you get around the baseball field. 

I personally have gone all the way in order to obtain money for a fix a couple of times (sorry if that’s TMI it probably is) and had to hide my symptoms and pretend to enjoy myself. I even cheated on a monogamous partner for money one time because I was so desperate. They (janes n johns) had to know, they had to...anyone who is willing to go all the way through paid sex with someone who is obviously withdrawing without at least helping them fix first is probably a sick disgusting fuck, just saying. If I were the type of guy that paid for sex and a hooker came to my house shaking and dirty and sweating and crying in withdrawals I’d just give her the money, let her shower, and tell her to go fix up. 

Or him, whatever your preference is, not tryna be politically incorrect just illustrating a point. If I had opiates I’d hand them over for free. People who dangle addictive substances in front of people as a way of manipulating them into having sex are literally some of the scariest types of people on the planet.UhuhyuhbruhI snort a abundance of them too lol.i always wanted to try, when i no longer wanted to live i went for itlmao dude what the hell are you even saying. you sprinkle “fentynal” on your mcdonald’s fries for fun? that’s a joke, right?Why are you being downvoted?What basis. Just legit curious. works either way, try itDont call em oxymonster for no reason nowNa im desd swrious. Fuck salt fentanyl goes way better on the fries and kills you faster than all the other GMOs in it. You thinking i was joking, was a joke right? Wtf. Be real kiddo.. I guess alchys are having a different opinion.  And I don't even know what being up voted ann down voted means Fill me inThere's literally decades of discussion on this topic. It may be difficult to summarize in a reddit comment.can you tell us about how it went when you tried it? you are physically addicted to opiates, right?downvoted means that basically, people dislike what youre saying. generally speaking, upvotes and downvotes have little relation to the actual quality of whatever comment you mad, as ive experienced thru out my 2+ years on herenah i just like to get high, in some ways more than others. 
but the first time i did it, i drove out to the woods and thankfully it didnt rain that weekend because i was basically sleeping on the heavily wooded section of road shoulder, basically four days in a row. food was a bitch the first time, i went out on a really full stomach but by the end of saturday i was mega hungry and had to find the nearest mini mart and made a retarded deal where i got a guy to give me money for a future venmo. thanks to that man, he was nice. the two subsequent times ive panhandled very successfully even in really really small towns in FL. 
but its what it sounds like, a lot of walking around lookin at stuff, talking to yourself, deep introspection, being homeless for four days. its not entirely fun but its wholly rewarding to know i can survive for a few days on, and this is just me, America's fat of the land. wear dri-fit and the requisite socks/shoes for hiking because your feet will hurt, but you can mitigate it to a degree. 
i have to say this is not for everyone, and depending on where you are, you can get hurt or lost, so for the first time take more provisions then continually scale down. bruh u wildLmao @@@@@@@@@@ Title: So glad im done with that life lmao, Content: , ups: 633, downs: 0My hustle was always shoplifting. Best way to get  money IMO, besides a job.I usually sell shit to get shit Knew a guy that sucked dick back in 2006 or so. Nobody really KNEW him, but he lived close and always came around. If someone’s phone rang and he realized it was a dude he’d always ‘joke’ “ask if he wants a dick suck!” Dude always had all the OC80s. Way more than he could use. It’s all coming together now. He looks like a happy old man. Smiling as the sun hits his bright red cheeks, strolling through his opium field, counting the yield- About to sit on his porch and have a nice cold glass of sweet tea. � 

GET OFFA MAH PROPERTY YA SONS O’ BITCHES. I've always worked and had hustles. Only they weren't everyday hustles just for drugs. A lot of drugs were bought because we got fucking paid. To be young again...



Our main thing was hitting freight trains. We had an inside connection to tell us where big ticket items were. I'm talking everything from gold jewelry,watches,laptops. Fucking everything! It was so fun to because of the team effort and the money. Looking back it really blows my mind that we  were never caught. I'm sure it was millions that we blew. My aunt still uses the bread maker that I gave her 15 years ago. I might have sold it to her actually. Do it right and be safe.I use nearly 500g of kratom and 5-10g of cbd bud thats a good 130$ a month. Dont know how to finance thatIt's a dirty job but someone gotta do it!20-30$ a day hereThis is greatThen what? Sell the items?[deleted]cool?$100/day is super commonthe word of the day is JOBYou can make 130 bucks in a day flying a sign by the freeway. Can't tell if you are being sarcastic or are just extremely lazy and thick in the head. Pfft, that's cheap af. Alot of Ppl spend 3x that in a day easily on opiates of some sort.You could easily get a part time job working 1 day a week for 5 hours and would prob have little $ left over. But if the goal is not working then  you could collect cans and return them for .05 deposit. Depending on where u live collecting 86 cans a day shouldnt be hard. Just find out the trash collection schedule and hit that neighborhoods recycle bins early morning. Being able to come up with less then $5 a day should be easy.Just plant some poppies as shown in that photo...Thats cute try $250 a dayWeird flex but okYou could work Who gives a shit?$40-$50 a day here. Down from $75 a day. Down from $125-$250 a day. With plans to move down to $20-$25 a day in the coming month or so. But I work. To fund my use. No hustles or dishonest work here. Sell or consume items. I’d steal food from gas stations for myself because gas station attendants DGAF. Steal from big box stores for your drugs. Best advice is if you’re lifting from a dept. store or bigger ticket items, have atleast one other person with you to create distraction if shit goes south. That or find someone to return the items for a gift card and then sell said gift card. When I was a junkie I had a Mexican fencer who bought everything at about 80percent of its value. Big ticket shit is vitamins and OTC supplements, 501 jeans, and those big boxes of detergent. Yup, depending on what you're stealing, you could sell it to bodegas and whatnot. >Steal items
>post a ad online
>profitsince when and why are shipments getting siezed?Where the hell pays that much to wave a sign?

Edit: ohhhh you mean pan handling I thought you meant waving a sign for a business my bSeriously. I’ve never had to do it fortunately, but I had plenty of ermm let’s call them business associates who did. They could scratch up 100$ in an hour at the right high volume areas saying the right thing. Doubly easy if you’re an attractive female and are good at selling a believable story (holding a gas canister, forgot purse at home, car ran out of gas at XYZ, acting in a panic so not to be directly offered gas over cash, etc).  Oh, and I assume this is implied, but the most important attribute - have no shame (if called out / Not afraid to ‘hustle’) and the ability to quickly establish rapport

Most people I knew who choose to fly signs agreed that standing at a busy intersection is much slower than hustling a specific high volume cash business. Ironically, most vegabonds I know refuse to fly a sign unless things are getting dire- but will spang/ preform / use local same-day cash employment centers
WhatYou cant really pay 250 a day for drugs... Only if you pay for overpriced crap :DDamn dude dont be so harsh to meAt least you care since you took time to read my statement and comment it aswell. Thank youDamn .. good luck brotha ! I’m at 20-30$ going up that’s good your coming down I’ll probably be following your path so your ahead of meI’m too stoned for this Vitamins and supplements are big ticket? And people think heroin is a waste of money, at least it works.80%? How tf he make money he gonna sell it for 90% seems not even worth it for how long he’d sit on whatever random items I wouldn’t expect a fence to go above 50-60% tbh[deleted][SITSA Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2851/text?format=txt) 

Yeah, it's got a lot of people upset as it's basically a blanket ban of any RC or herb that's not FDA Approved bullshit. 

Fuck 'em.There are hot spots all over my city. I was in a gas station like 2 months ago using the ATM and this couple who were definitely junkies came in from the side of the freeway right next to the gas station and were talking about how the last car that stopped off the freeway gave them a 100 bill. It was real, and they bought a shit load of scratchers, some cigarettes and then waltzed over to the motel to pick up I'm sure. 

I just looked up the statistic. The average is between 70-100 bucks a day in the United States. Do you work in sales lmaoyes you can. shooting 2-3 grams of gunpowder and .5-1g of coke a day. nothing i bought was overpriced.I'm sorry. 
You can go back into your safe-space. For real. I've seen bottles of supplements for 90$-150$ at GNC. Shits ridiculous.That was on the shit that I mentioned. Everything else was around 50percent. Expensive Olive oil was another one he would pay like 75-80percent on. Most of the time they traded the value in dope but on more than one occasion I got like 25$ for something worth 38$ when they didn't have dope. We were regulars, they liked us is what I assume lol.If you steal from Home Depot (not worth stealing form anymore as they’ve added lots of return protections), lowes, or any big store with building/construction materials contractors and construction companies will happily buy any gft cards or “merchandise cards” (from returns, basically a gift card) at 80%.

That is because one of the biggest costs on a project is materials, right next to labor. If they can save by buying a gift cards at %80 for  hundreds of dollars each, they can pocket that 20% they’re saving on materials.

They are constantly scouring craigslist for gift cards, I would get replies within minutes of posting a 300-500$ gift card asking for 80%While I agree with a majority of what you're saying, I don't think kratom use is significant enough to make a dent in sub or methadone sales- I could be wrong, though. Jesus Christ that's absolutely insane.You can definitely sustain a habit by just flying a sign- you'll likely still be homeless, though. For like 12 hours panhandling?Believe it or not, when I was using/selling ecp for 9 years I worked as both a stockbroker and then as a ultra high end B2B tech sales consultant for a megalith of a tech company that supplied other giant businesses with their servers/services/software, basically a full stack (a normal yet decent sale could be 1-5 million $, but those take a few months of going back and forth and such)

But when I say business I clearly mean ‘business’ and not my day job lol. I’ve been clean for 2 years now. Damn thats some good amount of money thereOh ok yeah I had a friend that used to do that and also owned a construction business himself so he had a business account with Lowe’s and would go in with a friend and load up a cart with what he needed as far as plywood and lumber usually about $1,000 then he’d pay for it on his business account while homie loaded an identical cart, after he got all the shit loaded in the truck he’d come back in find homie n push the cart to the other side of the store and return the shit so he’d have his materials and his cash lmao and they didn’t question it cuz he had an account and whatnot. I thought u meant u were literally selling an item of any kind for 80% like $100 drill for $80 to a fence and I was wondering how that dude was gonna profit cuz it’s hard to sell boosted shit at 90% of MSRP. All makes sense now though [deleted]yeah I was working at Facebook as an engineer making like 160k a year at least (incl. bonuses, before tax) right out of college but still living paycheck to paycheck (even going to pawnshops and shit) because of my speedball addiction. I quit the job and the addiction last year and I moved back home to refigure out my life. I feel you on that. Thats crazy man 160k ??? I always wonder what I have to do to get jobs like that. Even 80k would be great it is crazy I guess but I was living like a degenerate, needles all over the floor of my one room rented place. I really just studied my ass off in high school so I could get into MIT which has like the best comp sci program in the world. I hate comp sci though and realized I actually like the humanities more. So now I'm trying to figure out how to go back to school to study literature. I'll probably never have a salary like that again if I do, but hopefully I'll be happier than I was. Life can be weird... Sorry for being nosy, but I can't help but wonder whether you got addicted to drugs because you didn't like your job at heart even if it paid real well?I hate to bring bad news to a fellow opi hound but there isn’t any way in hell a literature degree is going to pay you 160k a year.   (Comm degree here)Not nosy at all. And for sure that was one of several reasons! It’s part of a larger general dissatisfaction but definitely a leading element. It looks like that might finally be behind me, I’m just not sure how to get a job that i do like. Oh believe me, I know doing real work in literature has almost no chance of making anywhere near that. I mean, if I can become a tenured professor at a decent college then maybe. But there’s also the chance that I study lit but then find a more practical career path afterwards, like law. Are you working yourself? Curious what the career paths are like when you study comm. 

But anyway, I don’t need a salary anywhere near my old one either, if I can stay clean.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I've been found out, Content: , ups: 637, downs: 0We are the addiction network. [deleted]Youtube starting giving me rehab commercials recently :/An the "doctor" looks sketchier than you do.Lol, that would kill me. And it kills me that there are fucking ads for rehab. *off to yt looking for the ads. Only in murica (no offense) I was on heroin.  I smoke crack cocaine. Passages is the worst.Passages Malibu "I used to be an addict..now I'm not" with that super pussy looking dude. Fuck lol

Best thing to see in the morning after waking up. Needed a laugh like this one.Shit, you guys have commercials for rehab? They are not private companies, are they?Goddamit I came up with this joke 8 months agoI was an addict for 13 years now I'm notLOL I upvoted bc I thought this was a joke. Went to Youtube looking for rehab commercials and the first thing that comes up is the addiction network. Ftw? capitalist dystopia parodying itself? I just think this is madly tasteless bc access to health services shouldn't be treated as a private good. Those who need rehab would seek it out but no, you have to be able to afford it and no ad changes the fact that you won't get that service if you don't have insurance or money. That pisses me off. As if you have to convince the target audience that they need rehab. As if rehab was some stupid cleanse or face treatment. Gah. They knowIf it makes you feel any better it’s not based on any life decisions that you make except ones you express online. You could watch a video about how great opioids are aaaaand bam! Advertisement!Very expensive ads too. Google actually just stopped allowing companies to run pay per click ads for rehabs to try and curb deceptive business practices. It really is an American phenomenon.Yes they are, they're predators, they don't care if you get better, hell, they don't want you to. They have no customer once your clean. But let's be honest, we'll never be clean, we will fight with this demon until we die.Considering this meme has been around longer than that, doubtful. I was on oxys. I was on heroin. I was addicted to crack cocaine. 

Hahaha, those are the worst commercials, ever. I literally laugh out loud every time I hear "now I'm not"Doesn't even understand how his own condition works while simultaneously promising the miracle cure; that guy can go fuck himselfHe never was an addict. [10 Disturbibg Facts About Passages Malibu](http://www.otcmarketwatch.com/10-disturbing-facts-about-passages-malibu-founders/)I thought once an addict always an addict but this dude beat it When you consider that the same people who parrot how great the market is for healthcare, also vote against subsidies to help you, vote against regulations that would help you not get screwed (enjoy your preexisting condition pleb), vote down your minimum wage, and also **Are the people behind prohibition**... it starts to look like a game that is pretty stacked against you.They always knowHhahaha I don't even watch videos about opiates, youtube just knows me too well ... When Google does the job the government opted out of. smhThat's cause most everything is privatized...from prisons to rehab. It's a fuckling $cam.That's pretty damn fucked upIsn't the addiction network the one that's the front group for Scientology?  I always thought it was weird they say Hubbard loved drugs trippin on acid/psychedelics yet they are so against drugs in their cult "Dont kid yourself. Addiction is an epidemic. We all know what happens when we don't deal with addiction. Someone dies... or *worse* they hurt others."Yea then not long after there's pics all over the web of him covering his face after relapsing and having to be a patient st the place he actually owns haha.

Just the guys name was so cringy douchey.Fucking Pax Prentis. What a succbag. Confusing  two different commercials. [Passages Malibu](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s96XdnN6bNE) & [The Addiction Network](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeIsWu_pXhw).Easy to say when you have never been an addict.Yeah you can be 40 years sober and still a addict you can never not be an addict I am 3 years sober haven't been to a meeting in 3 years never did the step shit I just decided I wanted to change things up I hit my bottom. Not saying I won't ever use again cause to be real I probably will but for right now I'm good. But I always call myself an addict when we get on the subject any REAL addict knows you are never not an addict. Oh my god... this is so fucked up. Thank you for sharing this.You ever get high at work? I used to do that shit all the time never thought about it till years later like fuck me I used to get lit at work but my co workers all got high my manager was my dude for awhile I even helped him out a few times and other co workers smoked like 3g's of crack with me for free he never would let me pay anything always hated that I loved sharing the high I always caught him back when I got some flake though.It has to do with almost all your online history. Including the fast you're on this subThe free market is efficient! Efficiently giving those in charge more wealth every year.I don't see any links between the two, but ADdict Net comes of as trying to sell itself as a local treatment center, when in reality, I think it is just a referral. I imagine they network ppl into state subsidized rehabs and get a fee. For the most part, I think the rehab industry is a bullshit. The same assholes who own stock in pain clinics, own stock in pharmaceuticals,  private prisons, and treatment centers. A bunch of people making money off of us chasing our tails. This is one aspect of my motivation for getting clean and staying clean. Rehab didn't get me clean, but seeing it for what a fucking scam it was a motivation.     
Edit- you may be thinking of [Narconon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narconon). Keep scrolling through the Wiki so you can see all the ppl who died while under their care. But considering how Scientology is all about the $, delving into the rehab business is not in the least bit surprising. LMFAO. Girl, you make my damn day �Like or worse they hurt others? Dafaqhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE8PgMHz98kOr worse....EXPELLED.Hahaha, are you serious? I haven't seen that. I don't like the guy either, but that's a rumor in the vein of "Steve from blues clues is dead." It's just simply untrue. Can you link us to something? I'm not from the US so I haven't seen the adsI'm an addict dude, relaxThat's more or less what I meant. We'll always be an addict once you become one, that's why I laugh.Yeah, father and son are real shitbags. Even if I was a real asshole and opened up a rehab for $ubsidies or cater to rich fucks, I would at least make an attempt to give ppl the tools for sobriety. The shithole I went to was basically fucking AA meetings 3 times a day, led by volunteers!? Out of 20 some ppl, I was the only 1st timer, and one of 2 that wasn't court ordered. Shit a1/3 of them were literally dropped off from Jessup (jail) for court ordered rehab...after serving year plus sentences. Those cats were actually the most serious about the program. Right? “Graduating” then smoking crack!What was your job?You know I was gonna say that wouldn't be true because I watch youtube on Firefox only (it stopped working on chrome for me for a while but now it's just habit) but I guess I'm logged into the same account on youtube and google chrome aye... freaky~~Yay~~...,Yeah Capitalism!Lol I know that stupid ass commercial by heart. But seriously, how can they say hurting others is WORSE than death? WTF.hiGuy's name is pax prentiss. Some kind soul linked the ad belowPassages Malibu [comercial](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s96XdnN6bNE)Relax Dude, I’m talking about PaxFront desk at a higher end hotel. My manager would sell me his scripts when he got em and I would go in and bust up a couple in the bathroom come back and he watched the desk. He didn't mind he always told me as long as it doesn't effect my work he is cool with me doing them there. When I worked nights I would smoke out just go out back sometimes with the regulars I would call up and ask em if they wanted to smoke. We would bullshit I would come back in finish up my nightly shift paperwork it was a sweet gig worked there for about 5 years till I just had to find something with better pay and more options for benefits. Even the owner of the hotel it was him and his 2 brothers owned like every hotel in my area the brother would do blow all the time my boss just drank from morning till night but he was chill as shit. Yeah probably the coolest place I ever worked as far as the employees go as for the guest that's another story haha.If you use an android phone it can read everything on that, unless you disable it[deleted]Holy fuck I'm dying at this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE8PgMHz98kHaha what a twat. Thanks for the link. My bad, sometimes it's hard to tell what people mean in text.That doesn't make sense. Any loving family would much rather the addict be alive than dead...The death of the junkie is going to fuck up that family more then anything. They’ll never be the same again. At least when alive you have a chance at getting sober and getting your life together. Lol did someone dose me with datura? I think its in there specifically targeting a certain demographic. The "Fuck my life, I don't care if I die I deserve it", super strung out, deep deep in addiction person. Theoretically, they realize their addiction isn't just hurting themselves - who they could give a fuck about - but also their family, who they care about. I am not saying it works at all, just saying it is probably the angle they were going for.I see what you're saying. Thanks for explaining it this way. I just thought it was a super weird thing to say in a commercial like that. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Medium Rare, Content: , ups: 626, downs: 0Why do they let people withdraw in Jail, it's fuckin sadistic[deleted]The bottom is definitely the case, went to the treatment center down in Florida, was hooked up with all of that. 

But I’ve also kicked massive fentanalog use while in jail, as well as kicked suboxone and noids together in another trip to jail. LOOOOOOOLFor any interested, tramadol as well as others, are available OTC in the Dominican Republic I've done all of these except the bottom 2 fmlRaw steak- The same as rare except you pay an arm and a leg to buy a sub in jail and then put yourself into pwd by taking it too early.Put me down for #3...� done that at least 200x over 30 yrsMy pain doc says that Tramadol is harder to quit than Oxycodone. (In equianalgesic doses.)Been there done all of these. Except it was 150 mg of methadone. I ain’t even going into what I was in the jail cell for bc it’s fucking embarrassing.There should be one near the top that says, "Purposely putting yourself into precipitated wd so it only lasts for 48 hours and not 5 days."Dude the medically induced coma for WD is actually the best fucking idea ever. Done all these except the medical coma (2nd to last) also replace the florida treatment center with a dif. E. Coast city and also not a tramadol habit.  From what I have heard tho tramadol as a hell of a withdrawl... Alwats wondered if it was true.the first one is the worst hands down!Hmm, I seem to like my WDs medium rare, just like my steak. Ive done them all except been to jail, but also i wasnt on subs when i was getting sll the other stuff, just that plus a few robaxin. Also i wasnt on 250 mg of methadone. Got to 70 and they kicked me out so had to go cold turkey off itMedium for meThe bottom one is so good How is quitting in jail worse than quitting under a Bridge while homelees ?Haha I do #3 almost monthly from pill withdrawl hahahaI could potentially be raw on Thursday  ���I don't get the masturbation part.  Is that because of your sex drive returning?  Or just something to do while you're stuck in bed?Shitty analogy, well done steak is garbage and blue rare is the best, so this doesn't even make sense at all.Has ANYONE ever CT’d off of 250mg? That’s my current dose����� but I’m going to begin titrating next month for 9 months (20% a month) until I’m done. MEDIUM RARE ALL DAYDamn I turn myself in on the 27th. I'm at 22mg methadone today and will be going down the rest of the month. I on 80mg about a month ago.Lmao I feel this meme. I just detoxed for like the last 5 days off like a weird up-and-down amount of opiates like some days I would take maybe 30-60mg of oxy a day, some days I would take like 120-150 mg, some days suboxone, but SOMETHING everyday, well anyway I did that for like 3 months thinking I was slick and wasn’t gonna have to detox, long story long I DID have to detox. I had to leave work early for the day Friday and the weekend was hell, I still feel like dog shit today and I’ll probably feel shitty tomorrow too. But I think I’m nearing the end of the withdrawals! Suboxone and Buspar??!

Sounds like a party. Ain't no sex like Suboxone-Buspar beach sex!This hit close to home hahaThis is so on pointRight in the middle rn but not $80 a day. Lower dose and my dope is cheaper[deleted]A lot of things about jail are pretty sadisticBecause the US society likes to see people suffer. Of course it is sadistic, but all the prisons in the US are. It is like Russia. Rape, beatings, etc. In many jails they'll give you valium, tylenol, and immodium for about three days.Under this meat-metric, burnt to a crisp would equate to *I took 15mg codeine yesterday, can I take 15mg more today? Or am I going to have withdrawals?*SameIt’s this way because only pussies would order a well done steak.It's 'rare' to see the more difficult ones.How was kicking noids I heard it’s actually withdrawal compared to how weed has none. Thailand tooWhat else is available over the counter there and how expensive are they? I’m going there soonInteresting.... any benzos?By "others" do you mean other opiates? For instance, are oxycodone or oxymorphone OTC?How about Nepal? Anyone know what's easily available otc there?Think that just means you ain’t a pussyThis comment hit me so hard I can taste sweat and artificial citrus[deleted]Awe man...
Come on now! You can't just say THAT and expect US to NOT wanna know why now?!Hey this is anonymous....just tell us lol You don’t just do that to us...does that work?Wait, Is that a thing?Man that temp would be “black and blue”Yes it's terrible because of the SNRI activity coupled with the opioid activity.

A lot more manic depressive than just opioid wd in my opinion. It’s hell. Imagine detoxing off an opiate and antidepressant at the same time. For me, going through this a couple of times, it took me 2 weeks to feel like myself again. The first week is hell. Phenibut and gabapentin were key on helping WD’s. Sorry never been put in a coma eitherLmfao same here.  Every month I run out way too early and have to wait for Christmas aka refill dayWhy do you say that?And you feel a lot better after you’re done. Something about that dopamine rushBecause it takes .2 seconds to orgasm lmao For some reason it feels super good and you wanna keep doing it lolDopamine[deleted]I thought of it as “you could eat a steak well done, but why the hell would you?” Same for the bottom, you could spend a zillion dollars to come off that way but you don’t need to. You could achieve the same with some kratom or lope for such a tiny habit and youre risking a medical coma. You’ve basically ruined the steak. [deleted]Don't worry just tell them ur an alcoholic and bennie addict an they will have to hook up Librium and u will sleep thru it.  U prob won't suffer at all.  Hope ur bunkie is chill with all the tossing n turning.It's a bona fide opioid with a side order of SSRI-esque dependency. It's like taking hydrocone/codeine and an antidepressant at the same time. It's absolutely addictive.NoJail is sadisticNot opiates. They'll give you water and tell you to suck it up. 

Lot: tell them you have a benzo or alcohol habit, and you have seizures. They'll give you Librium for the first weekFrom what I’ve read, some of those are a nasty m’f*ker to kick. One story I read was some guy said he had to smoke every 30-45 minutes to stop from going into WD. There was a documentary on VICE I believe that followed a few folks in the UK that were addicted and they said the same thing, they legit need to smoke every 30 minutes before going into hellish wd.

That’s all I need to know to never touch that sh*t!noids?

Oh yeah it was brutal, honestly harder than dope. Almost as intense and short as fent withdrawal, really it’s almost like the same type of chemical, just different class. Incredibly potent and short acting like fent, just a noid instead of opioid. Like seriously, hell on earth. 

And I made up my own smoke since 2011, once my area banned it, we learned what to do, and while I smoked it, it was either batches I, or my partner and crime would whip up. So it was all noid withdrawal too.Absolutely. I was smoking 14g a day at my worst point. I can't stress enough how bad this shit is. The withdrawals and residual psychotic symptoms (that I now require antipsychotics for) are seriously not worth it.Used to be able to get them shipped to USA pretty easily from Bangkok, but before national scheduling, the DEA dumped a shit load of money into beefing up anti drug task forces in Thailand. I would order 5 to 10 thousand at a time for pennies a piece. Good times. And Spain. Myanmar. Cambodia. Honestly too many places to count. OTC trams and valiums made for an interesting work trip... hahaDon't even get me started on Cambodia. Drug paradise.Codeine is OTC in Belize� me too!!It eases the RLS if nothing else.Yeah, if you take Subs before you're in wd. It feels like a week worth of wd fit into two days though. So it hurts like, a lot.You still will have 3-5days of withdrawal left.  Putting yourself into PWD won't speed up the overall process.Maybe one day I'll learn. Nahhhh probably not shit this month I've been on kratom only for the past 6 days. On Thursday I get a little from a friend that I will have to pay back on refill day thus continuing this cycle lolDopamine... helps restless legs... and feels good for a fleeting moment.I guess if you look at it that way.Nice name lolI've never seen it before the two clinic by me do not. There's one that might but I've been wanting to get off for a while so the time is now.The fucked up part is it's for shoplifting from Kohl's �����I've seen them let someone go into DTs from alcohol withdrawal without  providing help, it was disturbing.That is absolutely true. I've only ever smoked spice a handful of times and one hit had me in a panic attack for 20 minutes. Seems awful to smoke all the time.

However my bf's best friend since high school was a dope addict for many years and we used to buy dope from him. About 3 years ago he got hooked on spice. He has huge bags of the stuff all over his room. When he has it, he's an absolute zombie but just as you said, he needs to smoke every 30 minutes or else he'd be vomitting and having full blown panic attacks. It just seems horrid. Unfortunately we cut ties with him when he wanted my bf to start dealing spice, and read on our local PD Facebook a while ago he had his house raided for selling it. Idk how long the wd lasts but it does look like hell.I was every hour. Shit was farked.Synthetic canabanoids. Like all of those k2 and spice and fake weed.  homeless people been loving going crazy on that shit. That’s a shame.  I’m sure you could go dark and get em from there, no?Lol in Cambodia right now and Valium & Xans are easier to buy than water � I lied. The mdone habit I kicked in jail was 180 mg a day but I took a triple dose before court lol. I was trying so hard not to nod in front of the judge[deleted]I had no idea Precipitated Withdrawals on purpose was a thing!

It really condensed the 5 days of hell into 2 instead?!That's what I figured [deleted]How much timeYeah there's a lot of stories out there about folks dying from benzo and alcohol withdrawals on their first night cus the guards can't be fucked to do anything about it. Shit's fucked. Especially when it's in the middle of a prison dorm and there's 20 people in the room listening to someone seizing all night while the guards tell them to fuck off back to sleep.The full CB2 agonists led to me having worse withdrawals than Ive ever experienced from 6 years of heroin addiction. I was selling like you mentioned also. But that wasnt even when it was bad. 

When I became too addicted to maintain making the big batch and selling it, I was just smoking the powder. It was 5f-akb48 and a gram of powder could make 1-2 ounces of finished spice. The same gram of powder was only lasting a day, maybe. I was at that every 25-30 min mark or intense wd. When I finally got off the shit, the wd didn't decrease intensity whatsoever for 2 weeks.oh ya, never heard it called noids before.  here they call it tune or tunchi.

and yes it can cause withdrawals similar to opiate withdrawal.  they can be pretty addicting.

sometimes those spice/k2 blends don't just have random synthetic cannabinoids in them but also synthetic research benzos and opiods too.I also have heard pretty bad stories about it seems to be nearly as bad as opiates and possibly more dangerous.  Never done the shit myself because most are pure agonists at the cannabinoid receptor.  Delta 9 thc is a mixed agonist/antagonist if I remember correctly.My guess isn’t so much the ordering is the issue as much as customs. 

If your going to try smuggling a 100 pills through customs to make some money why not move something worth the risk and investment like mdma or literally anything other than tramadol  but why  would you? if ur on dnms already you can get anything id be ordering eu oxy or american pandas like shit you can even get real  fent free dope. anyone who order trams off the dn is complelty  retatded lolYes, you can.EwwwwI’d never dare do that. I did it on accident once and NEVER AGAINDon't do this. Mine always lasted like 3 days and it's way more fucking intense than normal withdrawal. Fuck all that.Only 45 days with half time so it's about 3 weeks just enough time to kick. 45 days it's my second shoplifting charge though.I doubt that. Why on earth would the Chinese do that if they can just crank out a new generation of shitty noids. Nah, they may feel sedating or dissociative because we have no idea of their receptor interactions but noids are most likely noids and not cut with substances you can actually have a selling point for.Yeah my sister is a dr and has seen a few kids overdose and die from it. It’s very rare but def can happen which is surprising that a canabanoid is even able to cause that. 

I forget what the cause of death is. I don’t believe it’s from depressed breathing like opiates Exactly. This is why we don't get hash in Australia like we used to. Smugglers worked out that a kg of heroin or meth was just as hard to get in as a kg of hash, but the return on the risk is orders of magnitude better.Yeah makes total sense lolLol I feel you.  Tramadol is far from my (or anyone’s) doc.  I was just saying that the guy whose stuff keeps getting seized can always try dnms if he really wants to get those trams.  After a few years of use I can get anything I want in my city and stopped using the dw to source.  Shit, my guy even has fent-free heroin, tested at my doctor’s lab to be high quality and purity.  Getting personal use amounts of oxy on dms to Australia is next to impossible because our customs is fucking crazy hot on searching packages. I don't know how Aussie vendors get it through but vendors in EU usually refuse to even try to send here. Trams, heroin and meth are just more commonly sold by AU vendors and much cheaper, probably because smuggling routes from Asia are more established and still work better.Yeah that sounds horrible but for the time constrained individual might be nice if you can stand the WDs

I’ve never taken subs... I’m planning on using some soon. How long do I need to wait and how much should I take?

Like 4mg strip and I do like 150mg IV? After waiting 36 hrs? Fuck that. I’d rather deal with five days than 3 days of pure hell. Thanks for the heads up!>But we've now seen cases where other types of chemicals are being found in herbal synthetic mixtures, including highly potent opioid relatives of fentanyl as well as benzodiazepines.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/07/19/why-synthetic-marijuana-is-more-dangerous-than-ever/#43da815be767

>“We call these cannabinoids but that doesn’t mean they are—this is probably one of the most varied substances we’ve seen, we don’t know how these things metabolize in the body.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/synthetic-weed-is-back-bigger-than-ever-and-scary-as-hellIdk if this has anything to do with it, but the 2 places where I used to donate plasma had a real strict policy against spice and had posters all over explaining that in rare cases it can cause bleeding, both internal bleeding and bleeding of the gums.

And I can't even imagine what it might do to your lungs, just based on the smell/taste/feel when smoking it. I've only ever taken one hit a few separate times and it was just a panicky hell for 15 minutes. I hate it, can't understand how people smoke it.Yep this is why prohibition creates incentives for stronger and more dangerous drugs. We saw the move from cocaine to meth and now we’re seeing the switch from heroin to fent. 

The war on drugs has always been a losing battle but it’s only going to get worse as our knowledge of chemistry grows. Is the tested heroin more expensive in comparison to the strength and duration of the fentadope?  Will a 40 bag of fent/dope hit harder than the real shit?

I think fentanyl analogues will end up increasing the demand for high purity heroin.  Although I believe this will drive the price of heroin up if only because profit margins will be less as the customer demands a pure product. 

 I think there are many people myself included who have basically stopped using besides maintenance.  I know many that have stopped because of the absence of high quality fent free dope and would likely use at least occasionally if quality product was more available.Its my doc.... What i started on ...Wait as long as you possibly can, then take a sliver of the strip (like 1mg worth).  24-36 hours+

Wait 30-45 mins, take another sliver.  Repeat until you feel better.

Some people will tell you they can switch back and forth between dope and subs no problem and they never get bad WD's, other people wait 24 hours and still end up feeling shitty from subs.  Best way to do it IMO is just take it slow, a little sub at a time.That sounds like a pretty solid plan.  You probably don't need to wait the full 36 hours.  Google the COWS scale and rate yourself once you're feeling unbearable withdrawals.  Wait at least 14-16 hours, and if you score a moderate to severe on the scale, you are good to begin inducting at like 1-2 mgs MAX under the tongue.  If after two hours you're still feeling crappy, take another mg.  Rinse and repeat until you reach 8mgs max for your first day.
A full 8 mgs is excessive, and you shouldn't need THAT much, but everyone is different, and you will decide how much makes you feel comfortable in your own skin again.  
Personally, I like to maintain on a low dose like 1-2 mg/day, max 4mgs split dose: 2-morning and 2 at night.  But in full withdrawal, coming from a heavy 1-2 gram per day dope habit, I find flooding my receptors with buperehnorphine the only way I can get out of withdrawal.
Slowly titrate and give the medicine time to work.  It's strong and you'll be successful!I still doubt that the Chinese would mix opioids or benzos into their blends. Whatever some idiot dealer might do is unpredictable. It's still idiotic. Benzos don't work well smoked and if fentanyl in herbal blends was more widespread we'd say a whole other picture of overdoses.I mean there is a LOT of variance in different brands and blends. Although a lot of them now are just panicky hell, there are probably some out there that aren't, although I'm not gonna go looking for them lol. The earlier generations were a lot different though with most of them being a lot closer to regular weed, just with some more psychedelic effects or more stimulating/depressing effects. They all got banned though (rip) so now it's just a bunch of random shit thrown together that they'll sell as long as it's active and not banned yet. On top of that there's also a lot of personal variance in reactions because endocannabinoid receptors can be quite unique from person to person, so some people just think it's panicky hell not worth touching cus that's all they've experienced but others will have different reactions that are less hellish to the same compounds. Also the majority of use now is in homeless people with fuck all to do who are down for basically anything, even panicky hell, as long as it's something other than reality, so they don't really give a shit as long as there's some relief.

Like I'm not recommending trying them or going hunting for a good blend (mostly cus itll be banned again in a month lol) but yeah there is, or at least was, a lot of variance. I haven't touched any of it in years cus of analogue laws in Australia basically banning any and all RCs so you can't just go to a baccy shop and buy some "incense" here anymore, and also because regular weed is just much more consistently good and safer.Realist comment in this entire post. Fair enough, my mistake.  Sorry, it’s just not super common. Okay thank you! I’ll make sure to at least wait 24hrs and make sure I can’t take it anymore. 

I’m not planning on maintaining using the Suboxone. So at what point can I go back to using heroin again? Like a day after the last dose or so? 24hrs?

Edit: Read your second half — saw the wait 24 hours! I wait until I am kicking hard to take subs to avoid PWD. I will definitely utilize that for this, just googled it. The COWS scale is great, thanks you!! 

What should I expect the subs to do? I should still feel a tad meh right? Just that’s about it? I’ve read a bit and it seems it varies on the individual. 
Seriously, don't believe every article you read on the internet. Half the posts about Kratom are so biased and intentionally ignore the evidence of overdose situations. Like, someone who took Kratom overdosed, but the article fails to mention the other chemicals that said person may have had in their system.That's true. 24hr MINIMUM. Seriously 36hr is a more realistic minimum if you use daily. I'd rather wait nearly 48hr just to avoid PWD. Projectile vomiting 15min after taking suboxone is not enjoyable.Same, I wait till I absolutely can't take it anymore then dose a sliver at a time till I feel better. The longer you wait, the better the effect of the sub imoYou should feel pretty good your first time doing subs.  It eliminates physical withdrawal but I would still get cravings really bad.  Hopefully yours will be minor though.  Lmk how they make you feel!I wouldn’t exactly say “meh”. I think they’re fabulous if you’re in a serious mindset of quitting dope altogether. They allow for you to feel normal again while still being on a routine of “having something”.  On subs (or at least in my opinion), you really have to make a true, conscious decision to seek it out and use again.Exactly the Forbes article has no secondary sources.Okay thanks! I definitely just wanna play it safe than sorry... all these PWD experiences I’m reading just seem like hell on earth. YepThanks for the tip. Def gonna do this. 

Kinda seems like idk if anyone else does this but... sometimes I like to get a little sick on purpose so I feel extra good when I fix my shot and get high I will be sure to let you know! I am going to be getting some over the next week so I’ll have to follow up then. I’m happy the physical stuff will go away — it’ll def help me out at work. 

I’m pretty excited tbh. I might just use it to hopefully get me by enough to the point where I can power through the weekend then hop off. Or just use them to keep me at bay till I pickup again... cannot decide. I just know that I need to take a tolerance break from near daily usage. 
I haven’t pursued a legal prescription route. However if I ever plan on getting off dope it seems like subs might be a good option. 

Usually I just cold turkey (with comfort meds) or try to taper down as much as possible then jump off. I’m kinda more or less getting to that point where I need to stop again :/. 

Are you currently on subs or used them? It seems like it really helped you out (just how I’m interpreting your response)  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 10/10 I would try, Content: , ups: 629, downs: 0But what if you already sold your house for dope? [deleted]I’ve been in WD for 3 days. I hate existence.I "allegedly"burned our house down and almost died. Then realized i had 3 30's and 15 or so oc 40's so I ran past the fire fighters and saved them, passed out from smoke inhalation, woke up homeless, but had my shit. Addiction is a horrible disease. Been sorta clean ever since that was 14yrs agoI actually knew a person that died like that. RIP FSCYo no bed sheets can light the fuck up lol bad experience If I had a dollar for everytime I burned a hole in my basketball shorts from nodding out and/or dropping my cig on myself I could afford new shorts.

I definitely would have had fire issues haha.I once fell asleep in bed with a cigarette and woke up 20 mins later with the blankets on my chest in huge flames. Alarms were going off wife was screaming everything. I calmly grabbed the bedding and went into the shower with it. I've stopped smoking and most opis years ago at this point, sometimes take a pic or two but that's it. I still have burn marks all over my chest from all the times I fell asleep with one in my mouth and didn't feel it burn me. Fun times.I still have a fat scar on my shoulder from dropping a lit cig there during a nice nod. Good thing Jeff forgot his shower shoes and came back to the room or I'd have probably fucked up my pretty face and/or burned the hotel down.This has really happened to me. Twice.r/shittylifeprotips

Edit:tipsThis joke is dark... I love it. unfortunately, my carpet seems flame retardant. The proof is the dozens of burn marks near my bed, recliner, and computer chair. Also,FSC (fire safe cigarettes), as others have mentioned, contribute to my ongoing misery too. i'm cool with the nod life. Oh man. I knew this bitch that had a black leather love seat and that motherfucker had like 40 burn holes in the right arm rest. I don't know how she didn't die.dankrecovery is omnipotentSomehow I'm 0-for on that front. I have to have almost killed myself in a fire like 200 times to no avail. My bf at the time and i were on a big chaise lounge like chair, nodding. Woke up with the house completely full of smoke, with the half of the chair we were not on completely smoldering. Was an area about 2 ft by 2 ft. Coulda totally died.No. Just set my apartment on fire and woke up to it, luckily.True story r/technicallythetruth[deleted]Why has godforsaken me? Fuckin fsc :(If I nod out with a cig I dont drop it. It stays in place and burns the living fuck out of my fingers.Loser Boo shit memeYou can still burn down your cardboard box. I miss non-fire safe cigarettes. Yeah that's why there's lines on the ciggarette paper now, it's for that[deleted][removed]FSC "Fire safe Cigarette" more chemicals to make it burn out whenever you don't hit itIt's effective for the beginning and middle of the cigarette, but I find that the fire safe cigs are much less likely to go out when you're down to 25% or less. In fact, on my cheap Sonoma Menthol 100s, after 25% it's much more likely that the heater itself will fall out completely. Which is even more likely to start a fire in my experience, having started a few small fires this way lol.That’s why u buy cheap natives or the bag ones

Anything without the rings that make it go out so I die properly 



Hahah no
If I was gonna kill myself over being sick I woulda done it one of the hundred times before today Damn dude, hope you're able to score again soon.Hi me too. Ur lucky it almost over.
 I mean I have methadone if I want but. Not the same. So I don’t take itSame here. The kid I knew was a piece of shit but still didn't deserve to go like that. He wasn't high on dope though, he was drunk as fuck.that made me burst out laughing lmao my chest hurtsYou died *twice?*Did you mean to say *fortunately* ?Once my barred out friend tried to cook ramen by taking this plastic thing you cover a cake with and throwing it on the stove eye with an unopened pack of ramen in it. My inherent laziness prevents this. I would've just eaten the ramen uncooked and woke up in a bunch of broken up ramen.This is why i like this sub, people dont give enough of a fuckin crucify this man over having a differing opinion.Jokes on you, I'd trade a box for dope any day lolYeah I remember right when they mandated it, you could get the regular ones if the store still had any back stocked and we compared the old ones to the new "fire-safe" ones, it was like night and day...just extra chemical tasteCan still get they’re just shittier brands and illegal markets or natives Lines have always been on cigs even before they made FSCI thought that was to make them burn straight. The lines help it burn more evenly. The paper is basically corrugated > chest

ow I’ve replaced my sheets 3 times already.I remember it being mildly different and slightly annoying and now, people  don’t  notice until someone says something then it’s a pile on but really I doubt anyone thought of it during their first smoke
Today unless they were reading this at that exact time
My paycheck comes in direct deposit at midnight, and I’m calling my dealer so god damn early.Damn that sucks man either way. Yea it would take a lot to deserve to die like that lol. In the persons case who I knew was just an older lady who was hooked on oxy and passed out in her trailer and then had a lit cig. Sucked cause she was a mom. i think i did.HuhYou can stay in mine for some dope.There was a period of two months or so that I only bought soft-packs because they tended to be less popular, meaning they were more likely to still be non-FSC at that time.

They really were much better before.This Wikipedia articles says all they do is add more paper to make it burn unevenly. How does that make it taste different?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safe_cigaretteI don’t live anywhere near any natives. and i’m stuck in my marlboro menthol ways, lol. Fuckin Safe Cigarettes FSC = Fuckin Safety Cigarettes?[deleted]No, not true . There's usually 2 or 3 bands on em. 
Bands are "speed bumps"TIL...Lol ya mattress look like Swiss cheese tho. And I know cuz ours probably look the same
I can’t afford to fix the mattress tho I no longer smoke in my house ... ughHaha, I know that feeling. Glad you don't have much longer to wait.Damn, always sad when a mother dies especially in such an avoidable situation.Im highDon't tease me with a good time �What do you mean how do they taste different? I had been smoking before they made them fire safe and when they mandated it they put FSC above the barcode so we compared them with the old ones by finding older packs that weren't FSC and everyone that compared them could tell a difference, the FSC just tasted like more chemical/less tobacco flavor than the original

FSC really stands for Fire Safe Cigarettes, they put FSC right above the barcode on them..Cigs def had lines long before FSC. It’s for measurement, they’re like 2 mm per line.I couldnt stand the FSC marlboro menthols when they first came out. They took twice as long to smoke and burned too slow. The non fsc cigs definitely tasted way betterYeah but I’m raging the fuck out I have cold sweats i sweat to god I tucking wanna kill myself right now I can’t take this shitMe TooYea they had lines printed on the ppaper.  What they are talking about is the new FSC (fire safety cigarettes) that replaced the old non fire safe cigarettes around 2010 depending on where you live.  These new FSC cigarettes will go out when you stop puffing on it.

Some brands of FSC cigarettes have bands of what look like a clear strip of glue on the paper that are about 1/2 centimeter long and spaced a centimeter or so apart.

Some brands dont have the glue lines. My newports im looking at don't have glue bars. I think marlboros are a brand that have them.Its sucks, that is why I fucking quit. Suboxone is my friend. Cheap as hell, not sick, guaranteed not to use cause it's a blocker. I just take my stupid strip in the morning and move on with my life. There's so much more to do besides either suffering or nodding.No access to kratom? That stuff is a lifesaver for me.Sounds like we are on the better half of this sub.What are the use of these glue lines?Yeah. I've been on this sub a long time. Folks are either over the top friendly or total assholes...

Aka high or in wdThey are too thick to burn by themselves so if you're not puffing it it goes out when the cherry hits that part.Yup this sub in a nutshellboofholes*Yea exactly, so when they came out my cigs were always going out and I'd have to relight it...it ends up making you smoke the cig faster and take bigger pulls and take puffs more often..it's just more bullshit they've added to make cigarettes even more unhealthy, all in the name of "safety"... @@@@@@@@@@ Title: A morphine bottle from about 1880, Content: , ups: 624, downs: 01880? Looks like something from 2880...Bang that shit.


In all seriousness, that's pretty cool. Thanks for sharing. Perfect for boofing.may be a stupid question but how tf do you get it out lmaoThis kinda stuff, along with just that whole time period where you could just buy stuff like this always interests me a ton and makes me start wishing I could go back in time. There are no words to describe how much I want this. I would pay exorbitant amounts of money for this. I collect antique items (my home is full of them), and since I'm very much interested in medicine and psychopharmacology, this would be the pinnacle of collectables. Especially because opiates have a particularly important role in our history and even brain evolution. I'm going to be thinking about how much I wish I could have this for ages now. It is truly beautiful. That's dopeInteresting butt plug � �️oof itThat thing has to be worth some doughGimme!Looks like a meth pipe TBHAm i the only one who thinks this looks like a potion from Shrek 2?Has anyone seen "the knick"?

Salute, comrade.Yes pleaseGonna need a real clean break on the stem for that to not cut up your asshole �Unless the glass tip breaks in your anusGreat minds think alike. BOOF BOIZ 4 LYFEThese are called [Ampoules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule). The stem is usually a weak point  and can be snapped (using your hands) to gain access to the contents. 

Files were/are also often used to create a score mark to make opening easier. Break it A true junkie never needs to ask this question. Innovation is one of his key wasted talents you break it likee you'd do with an ampule that would be broken to open todayyeah, walk into a chemists and ask for Laudanum, no questions asked. Or raw opium. Toothache? cocaine will do the job. 

I liked reading De Quinceys "Confessions of an English Opium Eater" in which he describes how he would drink the Laudanum, or raw Opium if he had it, and would go to an opera in bliss. Reminds me of my early days getting high and playing TFC.

He then describes how he then developed a habit, and because Laudanum also had strong alcohol in it, he was addicted to both opium and laudanum. He had a weeks long withdrawal and it did not sound pleasant. He had the mind-fuck dreams/looping thoughs where he was in a massive city and it felt like 1000 years passed for him.

I wonder why they banned opium, but kept alcohol legal? Was it to piss off the Chinese immigrants? Same with cannabis. Problem with opium is that it is very easy to die of an OD. Stupid kids would buy it, take a high dose, not feel anything in 20 minutes and take another high dose.  Then the first one hits and they are in bliss. Then the 2nd one hits and they die. 

I'd have opiates (morphine, oxycodone, H, codeine, etc) legally available to buy at low prices (it costs cents to produce a dose of morphine) - but it would be strictly behind the counter, and you would need an ID card to buy it. To get this ID card you must piss positive on a drugs test to prove you are a user. (Maybe even a short test to prove you know what you are doing). Then there would be strict penalties on selling to other people, especially children. But other than that, you go in, show your ID, "I'll have 50 OC80's please"I have 5 or 6 Morphine bottles from  the US War of Aggression on the Southern States. My grand dad gave them to me..I'll post the pics later. The paper is super fragile..yeah opiates have been used for thousands of years and society never collapsed. The ancient egyptians knew the secret of the poppy. The greeks knew about its sleep enhancing properties.  After the dark age collapse, during the renaissance, it was available in chemists shops in the UK no questions asked - during this time Britain built the biggest empire at that time.

It was the USA that forced the world to ban opiates. A bully boy country. Honestly, you described that so well, made your appreciation for antiques so clear, I wish I could buy it for you!Seriously? The fact that the label looks like it was made yesterday doesn't raise any flags to you as an "antique collector"? I've got a bunch of these out in my great grannies old root cellar, and an awesome bridge in Brooklyn, if your interested pm me. Price negotiable. Yes    it isEverything is a buttplug if your brace enough That show was dope. Wish it was still on. Exactly. People so Damn gullible these days. Label isn't even worn or damaged. *Your mom looks like a potion from Skyrim* �Just getting into the blood stream faster1 guy 1 morphine bottleits worth noting that you should always use a micron filter when using ampoules, as there’s microscopic shards of glass in it. I wonder if they had similar technology back then or if they even realized that was an issue.What about cutting your hands on glass I’ve seen lots of sterile water ampules made Of glass with I think something similar? i’m no junkie. just a lurker who thinks all this drug shit is super interesting i had no idea an ampule was even a thing till a little bit ago lmao Yeah I'm down for all that. Shit would be fantastic>"I'll have 50 OC 80s please"

>"Yes that'll be $50"Sounds like somebody is from the south. I'm weak as fuck at u broYou mean the civil war?> US War of Aggression on the Southern States

Based and redpilled.War of Aggression on the Southern states??? Do you genuinely believe that?I just posted a pic of these..Good one, boss. School those carpetbaggers! While I see why they got banned from a safety standpoint (considering how many lives I've personally seen crumble around me due to opiates), I agree wholly with you. Allowing things to be fully studied and understood is the only way to use their positive properties, and overcome the negative. All illicit drugs are left out of important research and people can't talk about it because of the taboo, and this creates the issues imo. Addiction is just starting to make real headway in medicine. Maybe future understanding can lead to an age of decriminalized opiates (and anything else).And now the us is all dying of fent. Isn't it ironic, dont ya think?

Its lilliililiiiliiliiiiliiiiike  feeeeeent on your coping day, its it's a free ride (to the ER) but you've already paid.I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish you could buy it for me too �I've never seen any antique medicines. It does look a little strange, but I figured it was photo shopped to make it look nice. I've never seen ampules like this, so the thing in the pic has to be pretty old regardless. Maybe the label is new tho. I would very much be interested, but it would need to be shipped across a boarder so unlikely that's possible :(Dr. Thackary would write me the best scripts, wish I was alive back thenWhy do they even make vials? isnt there a storage method that doesnt involve broken glassThe glass is gonne break ONLY at the breaking point. If you cut yourself with that, you should not have access to these morphium vials \^ \^That's the whole point though, you see. At that time the hypodermic needle was still in its infancy and so certainly not easily available to your local chemist let alone a layman. The fresh wound almost always resulting from opening the bottle allowed for a simple, fast, and, given the time, efficient method of administering the drug into the blood stream providing instantaneous relief while the remainder could be consumed orally as needed for the ailment. There’s a technique to it https://youtu.be/3o-_E26rmWAI always use a OSHA approved method of a sock and channel locks because ampoules scare me and my eyeballs.Hey friend. I didn’t mean to imply you were a junkie, sorry mate.  
Was literally just making a joke about the resourcefulness of the average junkie, especially when drugs are at stake![deleted]For the daily dose.This guy has a pic of him with Trump right on his page, I’m not surprised lol. “War of Aggression” that’s a classic. The proper nomenclature is what I called it but it is known as the Civil Way. Lol Southern people hate that they fought a war over their right to enslave other humans so they try and make it like they were attacked unprovoked. In the articles of secession filed by every state in the Confederacy they all specifically cite slavery.My kin  lived it. We had huge  family farms in Alabama and Georgia confiscated by the US Govt, a long with all my family assets and our guns. Give em a Missouri Boatride..In the 1950's, the public was terrified of homosexuals, putting them in prison, saying they hunted and "turned" boys. They even made a film called "Boys Beware" where a homosexual was described as having a "sickness". Homosexuals lived in secret and were ashamed. There were big public figures who were homosexual, who hid it and hypocritically spoke out against gays.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the present day, homosexuals are liberated and open. Now, Junkies are stigmatized as being sick in the head, bad people, weak people. Just because we use a substance that is actually safer than alcohol. There are people in society who use and keep it well hidden. Here in the UK, lots of high flying businessmen use cocaine. Hell I had a boss in my school who I suspect used it (he was from London, always gurned his teeth, had unnatural amounts of energy) - yet they will all speak out against it if asked. 

Maybe we will get legalization, who knows. 10 years ago I would have said the USA would never allow legal, recreational cannabis. Yet here we are, some states and Canada have it.  The UK will be the last as our politicians are all cowards and boy lovers.Ampoules provide better protection from air/ moisture etc than other forms of storage and have an all glass interior for better inertness.Yeah that just sounds dumb to me lol, why they would use this instead of bottle is beyond me Why care about your shredded hands? Chug that morphium and on you areLolllll And if you *do* cut yourself, you handily have access to these morphium ampoules!haha, I must be really clumsy - looked up videos on how to break ampoules, did it exactly as I saw and still managed to cut myself..

edit: actually the morphine vials broke fine, it was a reagent test kit ampoule that got me.no please don’t be sorry i wasn’t offended at all! you didn’t bother me or upset me or anything at all i was just saying lolyeah it's a joke the markup. A dose of H apparently costs 10 cents to make. It might even be as low as 1 cent.Oh god. Que the debate about a 150 year old war nobody cares about in 3..2...1I am a business man, my company does $400M a year in  Govt contracting. When u get a chance to go to dinner with the Man, you go. I bet those Northern assholes took all of your family's slaves too! Fucking pricks!Your point is...? The Nazi party also had all of their land and assets confiscated after Germany was defeated in WW2. Doesn’t make their actions okay, same goes for the Confederacy. I don't know what that is but it sounds kinky af. Go to Mississippi  and walk down the street  holding hands with another man.  Let me know how that works out.Its a cycle that also happened with booze too. PS I'm truly sorry that Boris Johnson also happens to literally look like a boy, I can't take the man seriously. I live in Canada so I know the feeling of cowardly and pointless seeming politicians. But hey we got the weed now, so ot makes me hopeful for the future! Break it with your teeth and chug it like a bawsFellow longtime lurker, one of my fave subs My homie lives in Pakistan and can get a gram of some pure Heroin #3 for 90 rupees which is a less then 25 cents.Hahaha, nah. Nothing to debate. Just funny.I highly disagree, I'd say a lot if people still care about that war.That’s true, good for you. 

Edit: How do I get the gov to pay me too?Do you mean the company you own or work for? Curious is all. Good for you with way.Plenty of southerners ran farms and owned zero slaves. The Nazi party claimed aka stole land, assets,etc..that belonged to other people. So after the war, the land was given back to the rightful owners, granted it was probly shot to shit.

Very different than what happened to us. Our family farms were ours , for generations. The Govt took possession of our land, livestock, field hands,etc..

So the US Govt employed the same tactics as the Nazis did. Just roll in with a big fuck you, your shit belongs to us now.Lol..its a line from The Outlaw Josey Wales, when Josey is speaking with the Carpetbagger. I thought I was the only one.  Never used illicit drugs of any sort, yet here I am.  Holy fuckCare about it in terms of history and in an effort to understand where we as a country come from, yeah of course we care about that. A lot of important points in American history came out of it. 

But I'm not going to argue with someone over how something went down over 150 years ago when we have all the facts....and those arguing on one side have a tendency to be apologists for slavery. That I don't care forFile a tax return.No, I am just a cog in wheel. It's a publicly traded entity. We are known as a Blue Chip company � I run  the Mexico/Central America operations. IIRC it was $20k for a seat at his table that night. It came out my personal budget for the year but it was well worth it. Lol I hear you man but to call the civil war "the war of northern aggression" is fucking absurd.I have no desire to argue. I disagree and leave it at that. Eh,  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Never ask how is a G, Content: , ups: 618, downs: 0**Me** “Yo u good right now??”

**Plug** “Yo... I really appreciate you asking, bro- things have been pretty hectic lately what with Nino taking over the old spot. Fiends ain’t payin they tab, neither. It be hurting my feelings dude, for real...”

**Me** *Silence*

**Plug** “And my grandmom, you know I be treating her right, but the other day she call me the wrong name- it kills me to see her fade away like that, she raised me and my sister right like my mama couldn’t.”

**Me** *Silence*

**Plug** “My girl, she aight. Been with me since the beginning, ride or die. Got that birthday round the corner though, you already know she getting that Louis bag. She loyal as fuck, you know? You be that way too...”

**Me** “Wow, thanks. I’m sorry shit’s so wild, I’m just trying to cop a few buns...”This been posted so many times, but it still makes me laugh. Has anyone else had awkward moments of dealers try to be buddies with you? Like, dude you're a nice guy, but I'm trying to get back to my place to get well as soon as possible and I really don't care about hearing what your kid did today.If a dealer wants you to stay for just a little so it doesnt look so bad with people coming in and out i can respect that but most of the time i just want to get my drugs and go home or where ever and enjoy them, i don't like making the drug buying process take any longer than it has to takeShit in my experience it pays to play therapist for a bit...hang around long enough and they go "man here's a bag/pill for sitting here listening to me, i know you need to get well" ...worked for me every time.  

Then again, im a small blond haired blue eyed girl...that might also have something to do with it. Never fucked for drugs tho, never had to. I've forced my friendship on every dealer I've had and it paid off big time for me. I don’t sell weed anymore but I felt this. I used to have some of my best friends stop by after not talking to them for months, and they just want to cop a dub and leave. It’s fucked up. My plug is this younger Mexican guy well I go to his parents house to meet him down the street from mine. His mom always tries to feed me and his dad always Acts super impressed with a little bit of Spanish I know and tries to teach me more, and the plug is always fucking spawn the fuck out on drugs definitely not heroin, he's really into Crystal and girl plus he goes out and drinks every night and he's a champion professional boxer in our area so he's a fucking whole trip on his own. meeting him out and about can be super fucking hectic. But I love going chilling at his Folk's place especially when there is some fucking lengua or some Cabeza braising in a stock pot before it gets fried up on their flat top. Definitely had to go to a lot worse dope spots. I'm actually going to start seeing one of his runners when he gets back out of jail in March. That's who I initially was getting served from but since the plug had seen me running errands and doing a shift for other dope boys and being a tester he didn't mind directly serving me. It's turned out to be totally fuckingawesome is my gram price got cut in half and I never have any cut on my shit. I mean at least from my dude. Legit as fuck old school cartel ties. junkally blessed right nowTell ej he needs to get some friends My guys (both current and past), did not want to hear about my problems. Very kind and friendly people, but it was pretty much straight business. With some people, this is just good pusher/client etiquette. I've done small favors here and there though. I strive to be the ideal client, so I get taken care of promptly when I call and this approach has usually worked. I laughed way too hard at this. But seriously tho. They never ask if a nigga good , they always asks if it's good but they never ask if I'm good �Aw poor EJ.Just because I'm bad guy, does not make me bad guy

That's what this reminds me of for some reasonBTW I’d never of thought this post would get so many upvotes�� right like I got time to hear about nana and Shaquilla purse just give me shit so I can get out the hoodThe scary part is when that convo goes the other way-ur dealer asking if ur ok, you don't look so good, have you eaten lately? And then you just open up, and he's like....yeahhhhh listen i got a few stops to make so....  

That was near the beginning of the end for me �Yo I’m stoned. This king Louis got me reading every word 5 times, and I’m still confused. My dogs are licking my ankles like lil junkies, and I love all y’all. May you all stay safe. ���I know, I still just picture a big ass D boi all in his feels and shit... why deez niqqas never wanna chill no more? Head in hands and what not Lol heartless... no they usually only want my $$ lol but I’ll talk of you coming off a few extra pills and paying for friends Yes and you don't want to hurt his feelings I totally agree w you and I have no issue sitting for 5-10 minutes, I actually usually do that so I’m not running in and out. 

I much rather meet at a store, both grab a pop/soda and make the exchange and walk out... easy peezy Now see there is a difference from forced friendship to a therapist, I have a girl that gets shit all the time and she acts like my BFF, I never remember telling her I had kids but yet she always ask and I’m always like “look not being mean but I have friends “ she not a small hot blonde but either way it wouldn’t matter. It’s all about money now if I’ve known you forever that’s a different story I’ll chill and talk other then that it s“off till the next text”.That's what they all sayYou should write a story. Maybe it becomes a screenplay. You got a grimy ass writing style (from what I felt reading this) that is what I’m always looking for with books and movies. 

Sorry so random I just had to say something. Must be on that Dirty South Coast I’m assuming Damn EJ only started hustling to make friends... yet has no friends Bro there are like 5 classes of junkie, including me I’m just trying to come up w 5 names lol��� right it’s always about them and don’t even ask me how my day is goingI know right poor fella just wants some friends to smoke and chill with, the guy I go to at times actually turned out as a good buddy where now we actually go hang , I’m in his wedding party because no one ever wants to hang w him they want their shit and bounce. I’ve been to his baby shower, family bbq’s usually only white guy there but hey all good. Nah im friends with all my dealers. Smoke blunts and take bumps with acid guy, smoke out my weed guy, im my own ghb and opiate/benzo guy 

Its nice to be friends with dealers. Got 3 tabs of lucy for free and get smoked out alotI agree. I sitting in his house sick and he wants to talk. Let me get straight and then you can blabber. [deleted]Shit I'm so emotional right now for some reason that made me tear up � I'm gonna text my guy right now and bake him some cookies Yes me too, since i shoot i don't like doing it at my dealer's house because he doesnt really like it much so i usually wait til after i leave and stop at the first gas station to do some so i love it when he has me meet him there so that way the whole process is quicker and I'm already where i want to be to get highSee I don't deal with people I don't know, when I have to find a new dealer I ask around and have a friend hook me up. If it's good, you're stuck with me now. So after a month or 2 of seeing you almost every day, we're gonna start to chat. That's just how I am, I'm great with small talk and like to be friendly. So I just always end up forming friendships. Idk if its just me or what, but I've heard so many times "i don't usually let people come to the house like this", I'll get invited to parties or whatever. My last dealer was cartel, and he told me once he doesn't even sell to users like me in the small amounts I'd get, but I was always on time and he liked me. Dude had a serious gf too and we all became good friends, it wasn't like he was trying to bang. He just...liked me lol. 

In contrast would be a friend of mine that hops on some app every time he wants to pick up. He doesn't keep people's numbers or establish relationships, just quick deals with whoever is around. That is sketch af to me and just increases the chances of getting set up. He was always scamming people too, like if he linked up with some tiny dude he would just take the bag and hop out the car without paying...imo he was doing a lot of work for a small amount of free shit, where as I put in a little bit of friendliness and got a junkies dream in return. Being welcome at a house that never had less than 5k m boxes at a time was my personal heaven. If I didn't want to pay I just had to chill long enough (read 30 mins) to be offered some.  

Edit: im always vocal about having a boyfriend too, whether i actually do or not. For me it set the vibe that im not a trap ho, and don't fuck for drugs. Lol what do you mean??Hey random redditor, I really appreciate that. My mom and therapist both tell me I should write bc they like what I put out, but you're the first person who's told me that outside of people who are obliged to love and support me lol.  

Thank you. It means a lot. True gratitude and appreciation for others are things I get to enjoy now that I'm sober, so thank you for that. That's sweet, I respect that.Yea I was being sarcastic, I’m friends w my pill dude and his dad lol... they both will undercut each other it actually funny as hell. It took a little time but worth it cuz he will grab pandas for me without asking and just text me wholesale prices.Lol I know aint no one on here smoking blunts and taking dumps, but that's what I read. I think I may be dyslexic or some shit.Metro where you been blood? I haven’t seen you in a minute my niqqa... Every time I see my mom. 

“You’ve got a nasty cough going on. Are you ok?”

“Yea it’s just that time of the year again” 

“Here. This essential oil blend helps strengthen and clean your lungs out. It’s not cheap though.”Damn I need custo’s that bake me cookies, glad I could make ya laugh.

Happy New Year be safe!!!

I done already F’ed up 2019 but 2020 is all meYea I see your point and I’ve formed friendships like that it’s just not really me as I know THOTS that think me saying “you’re welcome “ means I wanna bang when really I’m just thanking them for driving extra or whatever. I just have always been business is business.. I don’t front, I don’t wanna hear about lil Johnny hitting a T-Ball home run or your hubby is jealous blah blah..
I do get what you are saying as I have great relationships a my main plugs... First off you are welcome. When reading your comment I was imagining your brief post as if I was watching it on screen. I’m very much into film/movies (whichever you prefer calling them), so that’s probably why. I think it would be very interesting and you should definitely tap into that skill you have. Finding what you’re good at is hard sometimes. Good luck, friend. Hey the Dboi is human like us, I get where they are coming from, some ppl I hook up I don’t wanna be friends at all it’s all business.. shit most don’t even know my real name nor will they. Thats whats up man. Back when i was selling clam double stacks i saw a customer at work going to heroin W/D and just gave her keys to my car to grab a barHaha i hope the hell not. We take *bumps* aka shove powder in the noseI always gotta dump when i bump cokeI am on furlough so my money is really tight. [deleted]I bake my guy a batch of cookies twice a month! He deserves it :) I'd send you some as well if I knew how!

Happy New Year, love, and you too!

You didn't fuck up, it's the first couple of days! You have the rest of the year to make it your year and it IS your year! Make 2019 your bitch!And I see your point too, business is business and 95% of clients are just that, clients. I realize that I am not your typical user in that sense, but I've found that forming relationships with people who regularly have good drugs is more beneficial than just keeping it strictly business. I hear all the time that I'm abnormally easy to open up to...my background is in psych and counseling, and it comes easily for me. So it's never awkward, like if the guy has that attitude of not trying to hear about "lil johnny hitting a home run" then I'll drop it and no hard feelings. Its just that I rarely get that reaction, so an organic friendship tends to form.  

I've had friends who complain about the dealer wanting them to stay and chill for a few mins (you know the type, worried about people being in and out makes it look like a traphouse), complain like "dude im just here for my shit i dont wanna chill". And i don't get it, like usually we're sitting there getting high on the dealers shit while i wait for 30 mins to pass so I can leave. I've always got time for free drugs, idk why people complain about that shit lol. Yea I guarantee she was a loyal customer too for life, I take care of my ppl I deal with just no time for talk talk talk to everyone... not enough timeLol yeah I got that after like the 5th time I re-read it. The thought conjured the image of two dudes passing a blunt under the bathroom sall. Lol that's something more than friendship right there.MAGA �Sorry to hear that I just had emergency surgery in my eye so I’ve pretty much been on restrictions ... have to sit in dark rooms, no driving, no work... good to hear from you homie... hoping you a happy safe new year my friend Correct. 

No joke tho, that shit burns. I accidentally got residue on my hands and rubbed my eyes and they looked like I got maced. Lol I was just joking about 2020 I saw a post on FB earlier that made me lmao so figured I would use it here.

I mean I accept cookies all year around if you are offering.Lol who doesn’t like free drugs? I don’t have NO ONE come to my house, I have a few places that are just meeting spots A/B/C and know the owners of the business and I own a business so makes it easy, but different strokes for different D bois Hey check your PM.. I asked a question and want a woman’s outlook on itMuch Respect man. My benzo and opiate guy OD’d not too long ago (very very close friend) and I learned to appreciate those guys much more than I should. A lot of them were forced into living that life. I always bring food like a medium pizza or wings or even just fucking fresh toritillas (since I’m Mexican) or something. I never expect anything in return, ever. I just wish I would’ve done things like that for my late friend. Respect to all the Gs out there doing their thing keeping their people grounded. This is r/opiates. None of us take dumpsThx. Lol I wanna see this post now! 

And absolutely! I'm the cookie queen of the south!RIP to your friend man I’m sorry to hear that. 

You would think dealers wouldn’t be giving shit to ppl they don’t know what it is (fent pills) but this game is so F’ed up out here you just don’t know. I only buy from a few guys as I’ve known them 10+ years and I will literally take them to get their scripts so I know it’s from the pharmacy not that I don’t trust my ppl but I like to see for myself.That's why I kept re-reading it lol. I knew that couldn't be what he meant.[2020](https://imgur.com/a/k3kfoIP) Hold on I’ll send it to ya...Hahahaha that made my night, thank you so much for that � I felt that way at 12:01am on New year's [deleted]Lol- that is 2 times today I’ve made your day.

Unfortunately I had emergency surgery the Friday before the NYE so I was home in bed restWhat is real shit? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Found a girl’s credit card stuck in the ATM...taught her a lesson, Content: Man I spent so much money on it. I mean I had a field day. I bought a TV, an Xbox, and a new laptop. Dumb bitch shoulda been more careful.
Taught her a lesson.....


Just kidding.


I looked up her name on Facebook, messaged her and verified she was who she said she was like appearance of card, middle initial, etc. Then I drove back into town (about 30mi) and gave her back her card. She was very thankful and pleased. I taught her the lesson that there are good people out there.  Even if she didn’t know that i was, drug addicts are capable of being decent and moral people.



Why I posted this is because we all make choices everyday. I coulda hit a lick on this girl to go get some meds, but I didn’t because I decided to make the morally correct decision. I also thought about all the shitty things that people have done to me and I didn’t want to pass on that hurt. When I met up with her, she assumed that her card was already screwed up and that she was going to be broke. Instead, I proved that there are still good people out here in this fucked up world. 



Before I met her, I went and got meds with my own money. Money that I was holding on to that I didn’t need to spend but better me be broke to fund my habit than a girl who just so happened to leave her card somewhere. I went and picked up 6 30s. 



All I’m saying is strive to be better. I know we all do shit we’re not proud of as addicts but also, we can hustle without fucking others over and treat others with respect. Ya feel me? 



Have a good night opifam🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤



EDIT: WOAH! I just woke up from a nod (3:25am my time) and I have 130 upvotes currently! Jesus Christ! I feel the love guys! Stay safe out there. I’ll respond to comments tomorrow. I think I’m going to try to sleep off the rest of the night now. See you in a few hours!



EDIT EDIT: I got gold?!?!? And 350+ upvotes! I never imagined! I just thought I’d get a discussion going about doing decent things as addicts!    Holy shit! Thank you to whoever spent their money on me! I don’t deserve it! 


Ok, now to address the people who are being hateful (I mean it wouldn’t be the internet without them right?).  All the people saying “you would’ve stolen the shit if you would’ve been sick.” Uh no, I wouldn’t have. That’s not cool. I know this game can make people lose empathy for others but that’s something I hold on to. I’ve probably had 8,000 stolen from me since I started my addiction. I’m more careful now, but I’m still empathetic to others. In fact, I think going to trap houses seeing little kids walking around in dirty clothes and dirty diapers has made me try harder to be a better man. Everyone needs a moral code. I think all you angry folks need to re-evaluate and put a moral code in your heart. 


Thank you everyone! Much love!, ups: 621, downs: 0I missed the “just kidding” part so for a second I thought you hit a lick on her then drove out to return it to her lmao I was like damn that’s savageAround here a lot of atms won't even give you the money until you take the card.Respect. Should be more people like this out there. Know and believe I would do the same thing. You should have told her "btw I'm an addict you coulda lost bigtime. bye now" lol    


good for you OP I have a similar story about a wallet I found on the ground while I was in treatment, I was trying to get into a room on night for yoga.  The room was just being used for a Cocaine Anon meeting by outside people, and being the first person into the room after they left I found it on the ground.  It had enough paper to be like $200 I thought, and everything else you'd find in there.  I just went and found the group about to walk off our hospital floor and found him. It feels good to do that shit, but if found that wallet like 2 weeks earlier I wouldn't have done that. Even two weeks later, nope.  That's pretty much the only story I have as an adult of finding cash on the ground, hahaWas behind a guy late one night at an atm. He pulled away and he left his $300 in the tray , and his card in still.  I wasn't going to chase a guy down at high speed at 3am..so. I did call his bank to cancel the card thoughThis is such a good lesson. Life is hard for everyone we gotta work togetherThat’s cool you gave her card back. Not sure what I would have done in that situation. 

But, can I add something?

If you didn’t have money for your “6 30’s”, would you have done the same thing?r/wholesomejunkiesI do think this broad was dead wrong for not even throwing you gas money to come all the way back out to meet her. Sounds self entitled like a mother fucker to me. Me being the broke bitch that I am most of the time, ALWAYS tips very well, ALWAYS makes it worth someone's while when they go outta their way for me whether impromptu or not. I never assume people have the time and money to run around for me. Good on you for not being a filthy thief.  I do honestly believe our habits should inconvenience no one but ourselves, but hopefully JJ blesses you to make up for what that broad with the card should have done. I'm betting you were too chickenshit to run wild with itI woyld of fucking had a field day with that Thank you for being an awesome person. Great storyThere are still good people in the world! ��������
That was an awesome thing to do.  ❣️�LameThe consensus in this sub always seems to be, “getting well justifies anything immoral it may take to get there and fuck you for making me feel bad about it.” 

Before anyone yells at me to get off my high horse, I should say that, yes, I’ve stolen plenty. But it’s not impossible to make an effort so that those we’re taking from aren’t as damaged or set back by it. 

Instead of taking your family’s gold, why not shoplift from a giant corporation? Open bank accounts to overdraft like a motherfucker? 

Because yeah, please excuse the fuck out of me for thinking you’re an asshole if you take your mom’s engagement ring without an ounce of remorse. This isn’t an irreversible judgement though. I can respect someone that at least feels bad about it in retrospect. But to those thinking you’re *entitled* to drag others down to fuel your addiction, well, yeah, you are kind of an asshole. The stereotypes shouldn’t inform your personal conception of morality. If someone ghosts on me cuz I fronted $40 I don’t think, “it’s fine, he’s addicted.” No. Fuck that person. 

We’ve all done scummy shit. But let’s not pretend there aren’t other hustles that can be found either. That laziness or unwillingness to hustle in more “considerate” ways is what irks me. You *do* deserve to incur the risk of shoplifting or whatever the fuck else, it’s not your family that deserves to be taken advantage of. It’s like snitching. You wanna play criminal, well eat the consequences too, don’t rat on others because plea deal

In OPs situation, I would’ve researched the credit card to see if fraud protection was part of the plan. If so? Cha ching. If not? If she has high ass APR cuz the credit score is shit, it’s gonna feel like stealing from a bum. Am I perfect? Fuck no. Clearly. But let’s at least stop pretending this shit is totally fine because muh addicshen i gotta short this kid waaah Had you wouldve been broke and dope sick then what? Hey man I’m glad you did the right thing I mean really that shows and takes a lot of not only will power but shows your morality in this ....

THAT BEING SAID lemme just be blunt and honest with you here....

If this was a slow day or 2 for a habit sick as dog getting the last 10 out to hopefully pitch with somebody and get a half 30 to just feel somewhat off empty can you honestly say you would do the same ?

Be real man I’m not expecting a no or a yes just be real with it would you of taken at least another 20 to get a whole 30/15 whatever you prefer?And she didn’t even give you money? Like 20 or 50euro?? You drove all the way to her place, and for what? I Would feel bad if I were you..This is how everything could always be with legalization.This is such an amazing post. Thank you for showing the world the good. Your drug use does not define whether or not you’re or a good person, your actions like these do. You are a good person, this was a very kind thing that must’ve taken up a lot of your time but still, you did it. Thanks for sharing this great thing you did ❤️ I'm a super, also found someone's card left in the ATM a few weeks ago. I knocked on the door of the back until a man cake up to me said he was waiting for his wife to finish closing up the bank. I have him the card and he got his wife to come out and grab it. I also could have had a field day but I was taught better.Found one the other day walking home... Pin written on the back and it was the owner of a local restaurant so there was probably a decent amount on it.

Gave it back and they were happy.Well if you did it I bet you would have gotten locked up FAST. All ATMs have cameras. She simply reports the time used, they trace the time on the ATM and you're a convicted felon in a few months.

But you're a better man than I. If i was sick id.probably take.my chances and run her dry.How could you have screwed her over without her pin number aside from ordering things online. How would you have gotten cash out of the ATM?Good on you man for showing that all addicts don't steal and rob people.   What goes around comes around and I wish you well.   Be safe and keep your head upGood stuff OP, good karma headed your way. ��I wouldn't dare risk ruining my clean record by going to town on a tap n go card if I found one unless I knew I wouldn't be caught. I'm in Aus and know people who've been followed up and traced pretty easily using cards they've foundGood on ya homie. I try to practice the same principles as an opioid dependent person and it warms my heart knowing others do as well. Have a good one and keep being awesome!But did ya fuck er An absolute king
.Sorry life has not quite brought you to where you deserve to be by now,but It will.Usually you need to put the pin in again if their first transaction is done. Also they could have been recording you so possibly avoided jail time.Honestly I am a good person I have always worked to fund my habit, still get up work when I am dope sick but come on.. are you even a real drug addict? This reminds me of the stories of little kids turning in thousands of dollars to the police when they find it lol. I call this being a sucker. And she didn't even give u anything.. just think, she is a shitty person to not even throw u $20 or something. Now that is straight up ignorant and that's a fact.r/thathappenedOne time I was on my way down to the city to cop and I was texting while I had my card in the atm and I didn't click anything fast enough and it ate it... I was flipping out . But luckily i was able to open the front of the machine and saw where it was sitting inside . I think there was another one there too. TD bankWholesome I didnaame 400 quid in hambag left in cominalmarea not even a thanks like I'd stole the cubit obviously took to long to find out it was hersI was so scared for a sec, ya got me![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF2P-hLAZZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF2P-hLAZZ4) <3I am so proud of you fam! Good work!!Good on you! Was nervous at first but glad I read the rest. It seems that some people didn’t see that you said just kidding. I'm NOT hating but you're going to tell me if it had been 2 days since a hit and no money you wouldn't take any? I dont buy that under no circumstances would you take it. You're funds are good so you're not an ass hole. That's good. Some people are an ass regardless.You know, you could have done all that, AND sold that info to Russians?! That way you're still being a good person, and making money, and also being a complete dick!

Come no, whatever happened to being chaotically neutral in life?!  :(I'm proud of you. You are one of the good ones.Awesome. Funny thoughr, I know plenty of sober people who would have taken that card and had a field day. It's a shame that it happens. I'm glad that there was a happy ending though.  she would of got lickedIf u do not have boundaries, then u will truly b lost. It is so much harder to come back from tht. And we all dream of a day when we will come back. Even tho she did not know, ty for repping the good side of ur opifam. Oh, and.. never surrender!From a fellow dope fiend...amen . Blessings to you. I'm SO tired of society demonizing addicts.I had posted a while ago what I did when I was in this exact same situation a while ago (the opposite of what you did) and I got absolutely destroyed on here. I was about to be like, "see, I'm not the only one..."Man. Way to wreck a preconception. I am disappoint. Well nice job doing the nice thing. ��You are a beautiful human being. We need more stories like yours.After reading this I came to a conclusion. You, my friend, are not a REAL drug addict. Junkie scum like my self would have ran that shit into the ground!You would’ve been caught sooner or later While reading this the only thing i could think of was how hot was she? Did you at least try get her number or nah?**God Bless You :) <3**could have saved me 15 seconds reading that dribble. What the hell is wrong with everyone on this sub just break it onto 2 and put it in the bin. Can't believe people are patting you on the back for being normalNah man. I don’t play like that.  The just kidding is very important. HahahaHAHAHA! That would be savage as shit!! Lol. You did same thing I would have done. I would have turned it in...but I would have been hoping for a little kick down! :PYeah I know what you mean. Apparently, she was depositing cash into the ATM after work and forgot to hit “finish” which would’ve told her to remove her card. When I pulled up to the ATM, her bank account was wide open. I hit cancel. Then it asked if I wanted to withdraw and I hit cancel again, then it prompted to remove card.


She said she had a rough evening (she’s a waitress so she was dumping her tips in the bank) and that she’s so glad a decent person found it because she would’ve been completely broke if someone would’ve taken all that money out.Yooo Kyuss is dope!  


I caught them at Hellfest like 8 years ago.

&#x200B;

I saw Electric Wizard and Kylesa too.

&#x200B;

Shit was beyond insane. Electric Wizards set was surreal, like giant crowd swaying as one, I had no drugs but legit felt high as fuckAll Chase ATM's are like that where I live.GoodThe one I use beeps at you and if you dont take it within 10 seconds or so it sucks it up. Without a pin it's useless if it's just an atm card So you did keep the money then, right? Exactly what I said...Yea it all depends on the circumstances, this specific one I would return the card cause id  already b caught cause of cameras, but, if he randomly found a wallet, he’d run that bitch up no doubt about it.  It all depends on how much self awareness and knowledge each person has. Most of the time, junkies have little to none, that’s why they do dumb shit and get caught, giving them and everybody else a bad name. Now they’re are junkies who aren’t dumb at all and are perfectly functional. Apparently, they deserve the bad name in this modern society unfortunately, but whatever’s, everybody gets categorized no matter who they are. The one question that is on everyones mindThe one question that is on everyones mindWhy should someone be rewarded for doing something they are supposed to do? I think you just don't have much of a moral compass. It really shows.that's what I'm thinking too bro-sif/r/nothingeverhappensWhat language is this?Nope. I would’ve done everything in my power to not do it. I know it’s hard to believe that there are good people out here but there are. If I absolutely had no money, no meds, i would rather pawn my shit than to steal from a hard working woman who was so tired that she left her card in an ATM. I’m broke a lot and I’m dopesick a lot so I know how it is with money. Sometimes, you have it. Sometimes, you don’t.I prefer to stay in the chaotic good category �Gatekeeping addiction. Classy.No, you're just scum.  Junkies can have morals.  Don't put everyone in the same category as you just to justify your shitty behaviors.Ya sounds like you’re already just a piece of shitNo you’re just a piece of shit. Dude, shut up. I was addicted to drugs and I never stole shit. If I was withdrawing then I would just go to work and not make my problems other people's problems. There is a difference between being an addict and being a piece of shit. I'm sure you would do a bunch of horrible shit to keep your addiction going and it's people like you who give addicts a bad name. You really shouldn't be bragging about this...Before you put him in the category of a saint realize that he did what he did for the same reason all people do to get that great feeling inside of doing the right thing which in its essence can be seen a selfish. The ones that do good and don't brag or tell others about it are the real ones. I knew a guy that would give homeless people up to 100 dollars at a time, and he never told a soul about his good deeds or bragged to anyone about it. Let's be honest if he was dopesick as fuck would he have done the same?Idk why all the thumbs down. All atms have cameras on them and he even said her shit was on the screen so they would easily know who took the money out of her account.Not really. I know a few family members who’ve had their cards scanned at restaurants and the people who scanned the card took the info to Walmart and made off with around $1k (it’s happened about 3 times to friends and family) each time. None of them were caught. Exactly. Find an envelope full of cash with a name and address on it, return it, then toot your own horn. Are you 12?Why does that matter? One could quite easily have clicked back. Oh, and it's drivel r/boneappletea found the edgy teenagerGosh, everyone hates you.Bone apple tea my friendI think you mean "drivel", Iverson.Lol what did you dribble on?Kylesa!! I saw them in N*shville in 2005 and it was awesome, so was being 15 seeing kylesa hahaI'd give anything to see Ewiz. I just imagine a horde of people droning so hard. Kyuss and Electric Wizard at one fest definitely sounds worth the price of admission. 

Seems like I've watched some sets on YouTube from that specific Hellfest, now that I'm thinking about it. The jealousy did flowHellfest? Which hellfest are you referring to?Yup..Who cares? I don’t read comment replies so I couldn’t know..He’s NOT supposed to do that. Everybody knows “finders keepers,” he’s going against that doctrine to boost his own morals and dignity. He did a great deed and that’s why it is a deed, because he wasn’t supposed to do shit, he could have kept that shit and not think about th consequences she would have went through and the benefits for his self. But, the good man did the RIGHT thing most definitely. Yeah, except no. This guy obviously didn't haven't the balls to use the card, justified it to himself as 'I'm just a nice guy' and then posted here for affirmation, which you then gave him. The fact that you even have things to pawn makes me feel like you havent "seen" the shit I have. My addict career lasted 15 years. I only had a bank account and stuff I could pawn the first 4 years or so. No offense I absolutely commend you. But it doesnt matter if your mr Roger's or jesus him self, your brain rewires itself. Give it a few more years. You're not desperate enough....yet. I did unthinkable things towards the end of my using cAreer, things that haunt me to this day. I'm sure you feel like you've been around the block plenty and have as much experience as anyone else. But I can promise you. Even the best of us will steal to feed our addiction when all other avenues have been exhausted. You just said I'd pawn first. You said you had a car. Well yeah I did too. When I had a car and a job and lived at home and had extra money and was still tethered to reality, but a fea short years later everything changed. Theres a lot of people in here with nothing left to pawn, no car, their taking public transpo. So before you get on here preaching about how holy you are for returning a most likely un usable card anyways.  I think you should consider your addiction.  Its apples to oranges man.  You think the average heroin addict has a car a license and pays insurance? You say "there are some good addicts out here" yeah were not demon spawn until the end and were ready to off ourselves dealing with this shit. I didnt like this soap box post much.If you "knew a guy" then you're post means nothing. Somehow you found out. If you're the actual homeless recipient, then how do you know he told no-one? And finally, if you're the actual guy who gave the money, then why are you bragging?  I could go on, but I'll stop there. You're not worth my selfishness.Not if he had gone into a store with glasses and a hoodie and gotten cash back just saying if there's a will there's a wayYour right in the grand scheme of things it matter's not the least, and is not the purpose of the story whatsoever. But if she was attractive it could have worked out for him maybe he could of scored? I mean what better way to prove character than to do what he did.  2011 I believe, in clisson France.

Used to be a festival in New Jersey im pretty sure What a douche bag. Simply agreeing with you"Finders keepers"? Are you twelve?You seem super nice.I am not preaching anything, man. And I’m not going to get into a “who’s a bigger junkie” contest like l’ve seen in rehab or AA meeting. Some people just handle their shit differently. I’ve been doing this shit for almost 8 years now. My original post even says that I’ve done shit I’m not proud of BUT I think we as addicts and as humans in general can do better. You feel me? That’s what is resonating with people. That’s why people are upvoting. I don’t want the spotlight on me, i just want people to be good. Fair?Bro not everyone is as weak as you. Believe it or not there are some dopers out there who were raised much much better than this lifestyle suggests, and we tend to accept the dt's as paying to play. I in fact have been called a masochist for letting myself go straight into dope sickness. My only rule is as long as my choices w.drugs don't directly or indirectly effect pplvi care about it's all "good". Some of us can handle it...and yes you don't need to tell me I wasnt doing enough I was and sometimes still do. Your story may reflect the majority, but some of us understand that your going to suffer for choosing to use the drug. Know ahead of time and plan to fight through a few days of insanity.Go shoot up your dope buddy your stupid ass acts like I havent been thru every stage. Including the stage where you think you've got it under control. Like you do. Your only hope is stoppingNo i was with with said person when he gave the homeless guy 100 bucks like it was nothing. And never have i once heard him tell anyone or brag to anyone about it, when i told many people he was close to about it they didn't know of it and when i asked him if he told anyone about it his exact words were " That's not why i did it" That my friend is what i call REAL character. Out of the conclusions i don't see how you came to the other two which are least likely, must be all the drugs fucking up your brain.New York. Well it was a few yrs in NJ. That’s the one I was wondering if you were referring to. i know right?!Oh sorry, I took it the wrong way. Thought you meant that my comment was useless cause I was repeating what you said and that It annoyed you. English is not my main language. Sorry buddyLol i might be , and im pretty sure everybody else when it comes to that. If the owner is nowhere to b found wtf r u going to do about it? Leave it there? I doubt it g, quit playing yourself fair enough man. Mad props, brother.. I agree 100%,fuck being judged as all the same, etc... I been doing H daily for 6+ years with my wife, at minimum $40 to $75 per day.. I'm early 40s,in younger years spent decades in and out of prison and rehab (for trafficking, and rehab for hardcore alcoholism)my first treatment was 23 years ago, so Im obviously not no rookie or "haven't hit bottom yet " type person! I've been to the point sleeping in a car (no keys)in 20 below weather, and desperately ripping my beercans with a knife to eat the ice cause they keep freezing up in my hand.. I don't care what anybody says, that more then qualifys as a bottom to me! Today I can't stand the taste of beer, alcohol, buy a top shelf bottle of tequila 2-3 times a year, do 3 shots and give rest away.. I just woke up one morning and realized you couldn't pay me a $50 bill on my brokest day to chug a beer, I don't know what the f happened, but I love it and proud of myself.. first male in family to not die from cirrhosis, for real! My worse day on heroin is blessed compared to my best day drinking, I honestly believe alcohol is 1000% more dangerous, debilitating and life wreaking then any other drug (notcounting shit like salts/flacca, etc).. I have burned bridges, and reluctantly run scams, shit I hated myself for, never for my dopesickness, but for my wife's sickness.. long story, but  withdrawal,( 12+ hrs and on)is tremdousley life threatening for her,in several ways, on top of her underlying conditions, and many of you guys would be ashamed of your definition of sickness if you glimped what happens to her .. fortunately, I've got myself established and into the habit nowadays of never not having at least a few subs stashed,go months without needing to touch em,(a G lasts us at minimum 4 days and change, between the 2 of us) never crossed my mind to pick up a needle, never had, never would..we  snort only, everyday , since 2012 ish.. gossippy family members have actually wandered up to us and exclamed"geee, everybody bs about us being bad on H, so how come in 8 years ,never hear about us overdoseing , even dieing, like everyone else associated with h around here is.. basically it's because same connect for last 5 years, she buys so much at once that the type only changes 1 to 3 times per year. Talk about bulk.. always do testers when quality changes, and always make wife wait by me for 20+ mins when I do the tester, before I let her touch it.. I couldn't imagine letting my additcion worsen today, fuck self pity, I got tired of waiting to get back with a sub doc, or both not ready or able to quit immediately, so just give up? Well fuck that, I'm gonna get a head start on my goals, fiancial, relationship, even education wise, instead of letting haters win, I declared "who the fuck made all those rules  that  I'm helpless, lowlife, circling the drain piece of shit? "Well fuck that, instead of letting my earlier in life AA experiences brainwash my life, I decided that even if it's true when idiots say success is impossible while useing, so be it, I'll be the first one then.. (OMG, Adderall make me type insane, lol) circling around to the subject of this thread, never in a million years would I take her card for my habit, but I would take that card in a heartbeat to save wifeys life.. their are other circumstances that vary my opinions, if it was a rich Republican country club type that looks at my brand new Jordans in disgust as I pay in line with food stamp card, I would be grateful to take that disrespectful assholes card for new clothes, shoes, even jewelry for wife.. Oh yea, btw, I was born in the hood, inner city, bred and still live here, except when in prison never left.. we are far from comfy, live "check to check" and I have always delt coke and pills and occasionally H for income, just enough to keep our heads above water, and shop for things we need/want... Hardcore addict here, but there is a pair of shoes and watch I'm actively saveing up for, even in the throes of addiction... Flat out, guys, stop letting things define you, and if not going your way, fuck suffering just because so called peers keep telling you that there is no other option.. peace out , my friends, and no offense in advance.. I don't give a fuck if I'm not liked, I'm used to haters hatein all my life cause I also have a serious physical disability, but still got helova game, and people cants stand that on so many levels, you know?? He apologized. So we good. 

The English language is a mother fucker sometimes. I forgive you �
I meant no disrespect. Maybe I should have used the lame reddit lingo and typed "same". 
I appreciate the apology, that is a rarity around here. Take care friend, be safe. You sound like a wonderful guy/SSorry that my brain chemistry’s been changed caused by years of downer usage Mine too and I'm not a dick. Hmm.Hmm I guess your automátically a better person than I am :) pat yourself on th back bro and do whatever u can do keep your boat floating and don’t get off th high horse , cause dicks’ like me will knock u tf offf!!! LOLLol you sound pathetic and like you have a serious inferiority complex. You probably drag people down because you hate yourself. This is why you either have few friends or shitty ones. Hope you get better. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Guilty🤷🏻‍♂️, Content: , ups: 624, downs: 0He’s good he gets 90% of my paycheckWhen my dude got locked up (it was only got like a week) I got in contact with him to see if there was anything I could do to help him out. There definitely wasn't, but he remembered that when he got out. He was always good at what he does, but since then I'm getting like an entirely new level of customer service.

Sometimes it pays to see how the dopeman is doing. Sad lol
Maybe because he makes us wait like 2 hours and he has money and drugs so he’s gotta be fine lolHad to be a Blackman huh �Laughed then showed my boyfriend he goes “cuz nobody cares “

He might be part of the problem lolEverybody ask the dealer ‘yo , you good yet?’ But nobody ask the dealer ‘yo , are YOU good though?’ 
LmaoThis a pic of Tyler the Creator?This reminds me of Omar “Hey man you around, I’ll smoke you out if your tryna chill?”Actually I was always good friends with the dopemanI always ask how's the dopeman! Dopeman has feelings too.Cause most of they time they are lying, bull shit artists who would dime their own mother out if need beSame meme was posted a few weeks ago smhToo real WordI put $ on my guys books while he was in, and I guess word got around cause other dope dealers also treated me like a king. Dude got life, so I’ll never really mess with him again, but I really felt for him.God, the waiting. Fuck having to wait���� I’m from the west coast so most of my bth connects were Mexican or white. But the picture was just too good.Idk about where you live but mid Atlantic probably 90% of connects I know are black, but most users are white. Funny thing is they're probably the smart ones for not touching it so it's not like it's a racist thingJust stay on deck thats all I care about lol.I’m not really sure but it looks like his sad lookin ass.Its kodak black on a morning radio show called the breakfast club. Look up the interview on youtube he's fucked up the whole time. [removed][deleted]You’d be surprised at how many dealers also are users but don’t want their customers knowing.

It’s better business if you don’t actually know what’s going on in their lives. Some people and I had mutual dealers before we met, and when I mentioned I’d done dope with X dealer before they just go “holy shit I’ve known them for 10 years and they always acted like they’d never touch that shit” or something along the lines of it.

If not, good chance they’re popping other opiate pills.

Then of course there are a ton of dealers that don’t use, so I don’t know why I even made this post.And dont tell me 10 minutes when its gonna be 30, we good!!Lol I kno we was on your team for 5 years. It’s true ... we didn’t care how we were and no one else did either I'm like 90% sureFucked up on what? [removed][removed][deleted]Fuck 10 min right around the corner. 3 hours later can you meet me across town. 
It’s nice when you have options and can tell them to fuck off. But their always on time at first even kick you down an extra point or two. That all goes out the window once they know their your only plug.30? That would be fast for my guy. I call him 4-5 hours before I need anything No idea, but you can just tell he aint in the right mind. Id guess lean or some shit. [removed]Specific locations aren't allowed here.

/u/NorthBayPsychonaut /u/synthetic_opioids310Checks post history, sees exactly 0 pics of you ever getting a zip. You do seem very young though (under 21) and new to the game (got your first ever ball of tar about a month ago, already bragging about getting zips, constantly wondering if this is the life you want, still taking acid and other drugs p.s. eventually all those other drugs won’t matter cause your money will be for dope only). Please do not think I am bashing you, that is the last thing I would do: I started using at 16 and continued to do so for 10 years.

I was a dealer, so I guess my life was quite a bit easier than most (assuming your position is pretty similar) and I just wanna let you know eventually you will lose the game. Or at least, eventually the game won’t be worth playing anymore but you’ll realize you signed a much longer contract than you wanted.

I know I would’ve never taken my own advice, but I still feel obligated to give it: get out of the dope game. I don’t mean don’t use dope / opiates cause that’s somewhat unreasonable for an internet stranger to even suggest, but just cut back on all the “other life” stuff and try to actually live a somewhat normal life, use when you have extra money and a strong desire to use. It won’t be fun anymore if you’re using everyday, and when you finally wake up from the haze you won’t even really remember the fun times because it was a chemically induced feeling that you would now be feeling the damages from (you just won’t be the “old” you anymore, and you will constantly wonder what “life could have been like if only...”

I know we can’t stop people from joining our dark side, but don’t go balls deep into it to where your whole life revolves around “the game” / that lifestyle. It only makes it harder to eventually get out of your mental prison. And trust me: eventually you’ll beg for a taste of “a somewhat normal, maybe even one you would had considered boring, life”Hahahaha. My guy is Spanish and literally always says "10 mins" then you call him in 10 mins and he says, "less than 10 mins" and shows up 15 mins later� I'm in a big city so across town is usually only a few exits away. They dont like to stray far lolYeah after ten years I having my dboys apologizing to me and beggin for my biz (60k a yr)

I won the game bitches!

Never have only one connect and never have only several connects but all from the same operation 

My latest one just decided once I took my business elsewhere that he’d try to force me to come back (didn’t pan out well�)
THEN he lowers the price I been arguing with him on to my preferred amount, drives halfway to meet me, and is early not just on time 
Oh, and the counts are better even at th lower price 


He know if he fucks up one more time (left me 3 days in a row with no notice or temp boy) he done Yeah where I'm from like an hour away from where I am now, it's a real small town and my face is good everywhere so I have so many options. It sucks coming here and only having 1 person i van go to by myself.It just took me an hour and a half. Like literally just got good. But I also live 45 mins away. He said 11 and it's now 11:40 so not too bad Ew that blows
And not too bad; raise ya standards! They need you! They make damn sure u don’t know it but they do[removed]...and everyone clapped and got clean.Do u still use or na?That is some fucking great customer service. I only have one dealer that is honest about time.Damn 4shoThe post never said get clean, I never even recommended it lol All my other guys I have to go to a trap, so I just pull up 24/7 and there's someone there at any time. I love it.Hella hella hella brahYa, one unexpected day you’ll be at the wrong trap at the wrong time. You’ll most likely get to go home that day. But it still won’t be fun. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: are shooting videos wanted or allowed on this sub, Content: , ups: 620, downs: 0I wish I could like this...I'd watch lolYea if it's a clean register and hit, don't upload vids of you poking around and having a hard time thoDamnit why can't I like??

What the fuck Omw to get it homieFuck if you say so I willThanks bro! Appreciated. Insomnia is killing me. I took my meds, 1 am and it’s 3 now. Just came out to kitchen to smoke a cig.
Thank you! Every reply is my motivation!Thanks bro! I had a hell of a night! Wouldn’t wish even for an enemy. wat I mean I guess this isnt the same drug but I used diclazepam at 40-50mg equiv to diazepam and still barely could catch a nod lol my eyes were a bit cross eyed but stillThat’s only equal to 2.5mg alprazolam man, but yeah my benzo tolly is quite high.. I’m prescribed pills for pain so I’m still technically using opiates I just don’t get high anymore (besides weed)and tag nsfw if you wouldn’t mind, that way I’ll have to click into it to actually see itYeah, and the kid would've been pimped out. No I was saying what the other guy said. That he’d have already pawned it for oxy money.  I don't find the latter interesting at all, just as I wouldn't find someone snorting stuff interesting, but if they allow shooting posts, then whatever, it's definitely better than memesIt ended up being 10 minutes of me finding the vein, shooting a little, then losing the vein and having to find it again lmao. I'll have to do my first one later since I got some sleep and they're all fresh now.:(she wanted to do it herself. we basically had to plead with her to finally let us intervene /r/nocontextMy nigga You try getting sleep meds from a doc? If not that melatonin and unisom are nice... unless you’re already doing thatGood for you, that's always good to hear. tag me I love needle porn bro What a brainiac. You already know. Four days dry, it's bout to get gnarly. I got it from the dec who prescribed whole withdrawal process and very strong one and Not only the sleeping meds.  Still I have to redose most of the times. Drugs what ever I was on has the worst and the longest  withdrawals and sleep comes in months:(I hear ya. Even “normal” insomnia is bad enough. Adding WDs or even psychological cravings is enough to drive you bonkers. IDK if you've tried it, but seroquel has always knocked me the fuck out. Some people say it makes them groggy the next morning but I never experienced that. Good luck and congrats, 28 days is fucking awesome!I had one of the worst nights. I was just wondering around the living room until 6 am, almost unconscious from meds, but not able to sleep and sometime after 6am i fell asleep on one of the sofas. I wouldn’t wish this shit to my enemy.Seroquel is not an option in this country. But I have have a combo of several strongest prescription meds that I take before bed around, but last 3 days in  were the worst. Almost same as the withdrawals peak days that I had. 7
/8/9/10 - 17/18/19. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I lost both my arm and leg from an OD., Content: , ups: 615, downs: 0This is a picture of myself. Last may I suffered from a very bad OD and like the post earlier of the dude who slept on his arm, I slept on both my left arm and leg. I died twice due to organ failure, first time I was dead for over an hour, second for 5 mins. I woke up 3 days later without an arm and leg. Was on dialysis for a month due to acute kidney failure and was in the hospital 10 weeks plus 2 weeks in physical therapy. When I first woke up I told my then fiance of 3 years what happened, and she said shes sorry that happened but goodbye because you broke my heart bc you cant stay sober andblocked me on everything, still kinda fucked up from that but fuck it. I'm currently on bupe since then but if you consider bupe clean I've been basically clean since then. I lost everything that day, may 24th I lost all my friends, freedom, invincibility, fiance, a literal arm and leg, and my life, twice.

Edit: I am 22, ODed off what I believe to be some kind of extremely potent long lasting fent analog.

Edit:2 I had cpr done the time when I had no pulse, I was given 19mg narcan and 19mg epinephrine. And someone said in the picture I lost both legs? Lol plz look againSo compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis I’m guessing? 

Glad you made it.Holy shit... Story?Dead for an hour, how the fuck does that work. Thats a scary story man. At least you’re still among the living.take care man.That’s a dark as fuck story. God damn. Insane and very touching to hear. Especially currently being on bupe like myself. I consider bupe a blessing and it’s helped me tremendously and has kept me off dope for 7 months now. I really hope it can work for you as well. Extremely sorry for the pain you’ve been though and hope you can push through these gnarly speed bumpsI wasn't even aware that this was such a common thing... People don't really talk so much about this aspect of the dangers of opioids. In fact I recall fellow junkies being more nervous about folks nodding out on their backs than on their side, because of the whole choking on vomit thing. But I've never actually seen someone vomit while checked out before, but have seen (and been myseld) nodded out in positions that cut off circulation. 

I wonder - is this one of those things where friends need to look out for each other and push nodders onto their backs if they're passed out in awkward positions? Like... what's the safest position to be nodding out in? As I try to imagine it it seems flat on one's back is the only option. Seems like if you try to put somebody in an upright sitting position (against a wall or something), they could easily just fall over onto their arm, or lurch forward and maybe cut off circulation to the legs, or what have you. Maybe flat on the back but with their head propped up on a pillow or something?Sorry that happened to you... at least you still have your right arm and a leg. I wouldnt blame you if your outlook is down now since it happened recently and youre also recently sober, but you can still do great things in life if you will it. I wish you the best.This could not have been easy to share. You are very courageous for that. And thank you on behalf of everyone that you will help with the bravery in sharing this.Thank u for posting this. Im sure u just saved a life or two. Shit in 2019 maybe 30-40. Fuck fent.Are you still using opiates?Wow you must be so STRONG to rebuild from that. You need to start public speaking and get on the circuit.Fuck, OP that's fucking hectic.. Before today I didn't even know this was a thing. I will be so careful from now on when I have the nods. 

I hope you're doing okay.. <3Gotta say from the pic, it looks like you lost TWO legs. I nearly freaked man."So how much does drugs cost these days?" -me

"An arm and a leg" -you


Replace "drugs" with anythingFuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkDead for an hour? HuhMan I dont know what to say man. I feel like things will improve for you. Your post really grounded me this morning. I am in recovery in a woe is me mood. I had lost alot of things. Respect to you.I bet most just assume alligator. Ignint bastardsHey man, you still got your fapping hand. That's what's important, right? 

Keep your chin up- no matter how dark everything seems to be, things get better with timeI think you're an inspiration brother. Thank you for sharing your story. I know what it's like when people turn their backs on you for things that are now completely out of your control. I hope that someday you can achieve sustained happiness.I’ve been given so many extra chances from god. I’ve slept through ODs and got lucky that the shit had short legs that I didn’t suffer any noticeable brain damage. What disturbs me most is that I just found a 6 month old video my webcam recorded during a delirious Benadryl binge, and I had a full on seizure for a couple minutes. I can’t stop thinking about how much worse that could have turned out. The fact that I woke up from it 20 minutes later like nothing happened is pure luck. 

If you want proof, check my recent post on r/DPHYour recovery is amazing, both physically and mentally. Stay strong and clean man.May I cross post thisAwh man that's really rough � I'm sorry to see that. A guy I used to buy from way back when, passed out in the snow in January a few years ago here in canada. He ended up in a wheelchair for almost a year with half of his foot missing.Well may 24th is my birthday so it's bound to suck for everyone.


Sorry broI am so incredibly sorry this happened to you.How are you dead for over an hour?

Edit: I'm not trying to start shit, I have never heard of someone being dead for an hour, then coming back.I only do dope casually every couple months or so but in January I nodded out slept on my arm and couldnt feel it formonths. I didn't know that was as risky as it is. This makes me reconsider fucking around and be more careful if I do.Hope more users see this and seek help for their addictions. Most of my family and friends I grew up with are either dead, in prison, or currently still abusing drugs and their lives are always so full of despair and destruction.  What may start out as a fun thing - getting high and partying with friends leads to the addiction and subsequent destruction of said life. 

Good luck staying sober and hopefully finding a way to enjoy life missing your limbs.[deleted]You're an incredibly strong person, I hope you stay clean and have a good life. There are a lot of shitty people out there, if anyone is abandoning you over this, they're not worth your time.Wish you the best of luck in your recovery. Thank you for sharing your story.I lost 2 of my fingers to frost bite because I was nodding. Passed out with wet gloves on when I was sleeping in my truck one winter. Always thought I had it bad. But damn. Really puts shit in perspective.Fuuuck man I'm so sorry , goddamn you could be dead at least you made itThis is unfortunately not the first time I've seen this . hang in there .Compartment syndrome? Like blood trapped in area for too long? Or something else ...

I’m sorry this happened to you. That’s bad luck. I love your username. It’s clever. Makes me wonder what made you choose it. Other than the obvious meaning in the first word.. I mean. 

I’d ask a million questions bt it looks like this post is super busy with commentsI got Endocarditis from using. Got on Bupe and havent used dope since.I need my friend to see this. He is convinced that if he dies, he dies. And, if he lives, he will live as he always has. I need him to understand how life as he knows it can be altered forever.

Thank you for posting, and I am so sorry that you’ve had to go through thisGod bless you I wish nothing but the best to come your way !I don’t even know what to say this is terrible for someone so young...I almost lost my leg and life due to infect in 2017 I was doing IM fent with the long rigs and had bone deep infection they pulled out 1.5 liter and I needed surgery...I was lucky to make it out and recover. I’m so sorry man. I hope ur family is at least there for u.I'm not trying to be that bitch but one of your other post from a month ago is about buying a shit ton of pills. So how have you been clean for a year?Damn at least you’re alive my dudeI'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/morbidreality] [A lot of the posts over at r\/opiates are worthy of this sub. As a fellow junkie it breaks my heart to see the constant list of deaths\/ODs\/people hurting so bad. Here’s the latest that got me- a 22 yr old guy who’s just had an arm and a leg amputated after passing out in a bad position after an OD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/bekmkr/a_lot_of_the_posts_over_at_ropiates_are_worthy_of/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*How can this happen? Is it lack of oxygen from laying in the same place?I'm so sorry for you. Hope everything will start to get at least a bit better for you after the tragedy.Are you on suboxone or just bupe?You were dead for over an hour? how are you not braindead if your brain didn't have oxygen for an hour?I'm really sorry to hear this. Life will go on and you will be stronger for this.

I do have one question. Did the OD cause any cognitive issues/impairment due to lack of oxygen? If so, can you describe?Sorry you had to go through so much man. And I'm just saying that if you relapsed and are using it's nothing to be ashamed of, recovery is a long process and full of ups and downs. Just gotta take it a day at a time. 

Just wanted to say that since I saw comments about your recent posts about using after you said you were on subs.That's rough as fuck, hope things end up better for you man. Sometimes this life really doesn't feel worth it with all the bullshit, but I always take a look at nature and think I might as well appreciate anything that's here while I am.I can somewhatI can somewhat relate I am 29 been an Intravenous heroin users on and off for 10 years. Last April my leg was getting sore to the point I walked with a limp buy j was so strung out I just kept using and numbing the pain. One day I finally went to the hospital and I had septic arthritis basically an infection had ate away my entire hip joint, I am now waiting for a total hip replacement!...haven't used a needle since November 5th 2018 and down to 25 mgs of methadone. This will be a life long battle and I'm quite lucky the infection didn't spread to my heart or some shit. One day at a time is all I can say!Good luck to you! I hope you stay clean.Thanks for sharing your story man ❤️ I'll be praying for your recovery. I was thinking of trying opiates, I am already familiar with the needle. This makes me reconsider. May God help you and your family ❤️❤️Lmao!! Your leg is the same color as the floor! I was like “seems like he lost both legs. I could be wrong though” �


Anyway hope you feel better.How long do you have to sleep on a limb before it’s too late? Can someone please answer? I actually did this to my leg last night but luckily it was only a few hours. and how high do you have to be to stop your bodies defense from preventing this?If you stopped I respect you. Their is two people I know personally who had a leg removed st the knee and didn’t stop and the other leg was taken too a year or two later.I’m late on commenting but I remember talking to you on the r/drugs discord once. Take it easy man, you’re a good dude who was dealt a bad hand.And I thought MY shit cost an arm and leg...That's the reason why whenever someone goes out around me I straighten them out and use as many pillows as is necessary to keep the neck in a position to keep the airway clear. I always end up babysitting since it seems so many other j's are concerned with getting the hell Away from someone in trouble. I got enough dead friends.....F[removed]Lmfaooooooooo damn that sucksDude, best wishes to you. You still look very well. You might want to try to contact some sort of charity for a bionic/robotic arm or whatever is it called. Despite your loss of an arm and leg I believe you can find a perfect girl with awesome personality and awesome tits and ass. You have another chance. Best wishes to you.In these times everyone needs to volumetrically dose their "heroin" or end up like this

Spread the word, fent can be safely used.

https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosingYou should go to a NA meeting? Get a sponsor Someone with a year or more and working knowledge of the 12 steps. Do a 90 in 90 make a meeting a day and the 90 will take care of its self. Get and use phone numbers, dial them don’t file them! Take it one day at a time, take it easy. I’m a heroin addict with  2 years 1 month 17 days today. I owe my life to the program.Thank you. I’m 22 and seriously considering quitting opiates because of this post.Holy shiiiiiiit!Oh my god I'm so sorry. About 5 years ago I lost my fiancee (pre drugs, not related) and had a hard enough time coping with that. I cant begin to imagine everything you've gone through and lost. HMU if you need someone to talk to anytime.I’m 30 now and I had a similar thing happen when I was 20... I thought I was the only person that something LIKE this happened to. I did a dose made a phone call and woke up in the hospital two days later. I had passed out on my arm for about eight hours and when I woke up it was swollen as fuck and partially paralyzed with intense nerve tingling pain. I was also on dialysis for kidney failure and I had a heart attack and blood clot. They had to check me for compartment syndrome and the method for that is to take a pumpkin carving looking tool and stick it in your arm in different spots to see if there is circulation.. I think. Anyway I lost my home and pretty much my gf and everything that day too. Well, my girl stuck around for a while but the trauma of it all eventually sent her away. I remember I had to think very hard to move my arm. Like my brain would say “move damnit!” And then after a delay my arm would shoot up in the air. It went on like that for days and then after a few weeks I could mostly do stuff but the nerve tingles I have still. Like you could lightly touch my arm with a feather and it would be painful but a lot less than it used to be. I also died and came back during all this, I don’t know how long I was dead for.  I walked away from opiates after this nightmare, for some people it takes AA or NA but for me a horrific OD was enough. I still have mild PTSD from it all and I never talk about it but it haunts me. I am so sorry that you are going through the version of it that you are. I wish you the best and truly hope you can stay away from the opiates and that you find a better girl.Sorry this happened but glad you're alive and have another chance at life. And glad to hear you're using that chance to make things better as well as clean. Being on bupe is totally valid (especially if you suffer any pain from your incident - but even if not..) and while by the definition of some it's not really "clean" its surely recovery and a kickass job at that.Probably a giant overdose of something like Carfentanyl or 3-methfentanyl or along those lines. Both infamously stupidly potent and more/equal euphoria and duration as heroin.

Why didn't narcan help? I assume you got medical help fastYou still have life. Get busy living it and not thinking about what you had! I'm sorry this happened to you but maybe you can use it to help others so it's not in vain .Hey man, for what it’s worth, I lost everything in one moment too. 7 years later I am a completely different person who is capable of loving myself and others and found happiness outside of a chemical

It was the hardest fucking journey ever but worth it in the end. My spinal cord is severed and I’m paralyzed from the waist down. If something drastic hadn’t happened, my life’s trajectory never would’ve changed. I’ve learned it’s all about perspective. 


On a different note, seeing how we are both survivors of things that reaaaaaally should’ve killed us, check out Quantum Immortality, it’s the idea that your consciousness will always perceive itself as surviving if there’s a chance of survival. 

DM if you ever need to chat, my manFucking hell! I've ODed five times and was once dead for most of a night, but that is brutal. I'm thankful everyone I know knows about my use.Sorry you had to go through this. I can't even imagine waking up without two of my limbs. Must have felt like you were dreaming or something.

Just wanted to say that it doesn't matter if other people think you're 'clean' or not. If ita working for you, then that is all that matters. Hope you're able to keep going with it.You "see" anything while dead?You have a career in public speaking.Jesus.  


These posts are making me paranoid I'm gonna fall asleep on my arm or leg. Probably not gonna stop anytime soon, but def gonna take some precautions again.  


2 weeks of physical therapy? I had like 3 months for me and my fucked up leg, god I hated that shit.If there's some light there's light. Stay close to the things in life that brings you joy. Diogenes knows his shitIf it’s any consolation, you still look very nice in my eyes :)

Thank you for making me an 18 y/o, want to never try opiatesHow did you die for an hour and aren’t brain dead? You don’t have to answer obviously. I’m just curiousThe most heartbreaking thing I could imagine. Your strong af dude. UnbelievableHow can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did your heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygen, i'm not being a smart ass i'm just wondering. I'm glad you survived.as someone who suffers from a chronic illness that will always require pain control? and having issues with drugs because of that? bupe is clean. I have been on it for 3 years now as maintenance. It is the only thing I can take that is a partial pain reliever but doesnt cause me to get "high" or loopy of fuck with my head. I still have cravings and I will have to fight those every day for the rest of my life, but because of bupe I can be a functional human being and not feel dirty and gross. 

&#x200B;

So you and I have both been clean! keep it up. My illness has taken alot from me, and I have had alot of surgeries that have changed my body, but on the outside i only have a few scars. If I kept doing what I was doing I would have been wheelchair bound or dead. You may have lost a lot, but you havent lost it all.Where is your right leg?My heart goes out to you. So sorry you’re going through this. I hope you can heal emotionally as well as physically and spiritually, soon.Sorry to hear that man, wow.One week clean. Thank you. I hope you’re getting on well bro.Yes being on bupe is being clean.. don't let anyone tell you differently. Anyone who says you traded one drug for another doesn't know what the fuck they are taking about so just shrug that shit off. Your story is an intense one but my only hope for you would be that you can look into your future and live there rather then in your past, wrapped around this incident. Good luck to you.

Also, maybe change your screen name? Your not a junkie anymore right?Wait why’d they give you epinephrineWhat is OD?Yeah basicallyDude that was my thought as well... what the actual f*ck....What is bupe? I've never heard this beforeSeven months? That’s great. Keep up the good work.This. It's not really something I'd even thought of but it makes sense it would be such an issue. It should definitely be talked about more esp. in harm reduction circles.

To OP : that is just a crazy thing to have happened and awful that you had to go through that :( I'm likely going to keep this in my "look at these when you want to use" folder because just...wow. I'm sorry this happened but glad you posted here about it because.. Yeah I really hadn't thought of that being a possibility. The SO aspect hits close to home too, mine has said she wouldn't stick around if I was in active full blown addiction and I can't blame her.

Tl;Dr you're an amazing person, and I wish the best for you.I'm going to nod out propped up on my bed from now on, limbs will be totally free, and i could vomit if needed.Yea it seems so. He has two recent post about fentanyl and hydromorphone. Op says this happened last may so.........Lol no just one HahaYou could probably mod the other arm too. Mount a  flesh light on the wrist and you have yourself  a  neato cybernetic pocketpussy.That’s really sweet for you to say these things. You have a lot of compassion and so I don’t think you really need serious help.  At all.Wait, what? I take Benadryl every night. Is this a party thing? I’m going to look for your post. I’m glad you’re okay now. Stay safe. 

How can he be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did his heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygenOh this is good to see. Stay safe.No go ahead and PM me lol I had people seeing this that I didnt intend to lolWhat did they pull out 1.5 liters of?Dude never came thru, yeah its fucked up I still crave opiates, and I'm a pos for doing so. Idk man ur not bitchingGood botThey did CPR whole time and  I had PEA, Google itMan man. That was a while ago. And I letgot only talked on that discord once! Add ,me back Somnus#9244Thats actually kinda funny lolYou’re a good person.Seriously?Lol I thought it was funny lol life is too short to laughJust� braI've been doing this for years.. Not sure why you're being downvoted (except maybe the fent comment). I was terrified of an OD when I first started and so I used a sterile vile and filters to create a solution and dosed small (sub 20 units) each time I picked up new shit or shit from someone I didn't know. It's kinda like 'smoke before you poke' but more precise. I'd recommend both this and micron level wheel filters to anyone who IV's especially with them being so damn cheap.How to volumetrically dose H? I'm gonna end up using some soon enough I'd say since we finally have what is apparently good tan H powder.Remember attraction rather than promotion.Please do. It can get very fucking dark quick if you're not careful. Opioids will take your soul from you, if you realize it or not.You can do it homie. When u quit the first 3-5 days are absolute poop. Then you will feel physically 100%, but mentally, your going to be in a really weird, lonely place. Your going to say “im never going to be the same, Ill never feel like i did before opiates”. You'll get urges and your going to feel defeated but dude just keep in there because after 2 weeks, your going to wake up with a cheeck to cheek smile because your going to feel EXACTLY how you did before opiates. Just gotta tale those 2 weeks on the chin then like magic, on day 13 you'll be good. It works like clockwork trust me. Ppl who say your never the same just lie or never truly go clean. Just stay clean for 2 weeks and you'll be good and just remember any urge, any depression, any negativity you will feel is just the residuals of the chemicals in your brain. You can do it man. Don't use subs. Don't taper down. Don't do any of that bs that the pharmaceutical companies tell you. My indian doctor convinced me addiction is 100% mental and once you truly face that fact, there no more “i feel like shit until i take my subs”. Theres no “p.a.w.s”. Its just you feeling sick for a week and a half or 2 weeks, then you completely revert back to normal. DO NOT listen to the people in your rehab or any of that shit because all that does is hypnotize you to where if you even start feeling slight withdrawal, you'll start panicking and making everything 100x worse. Its all just a trap. You can quit soooo easy, dont let them trick you. Its like in vietnam, almost every american GI was addicted to heroin. But they didnt know how heroin addiction works. So when they came home, they just assumed they were sick from the atmosphere change and after a week or so they were fine. But if you sat them down and explained to them they are addicted to heroin, their mind will start filling in the blanks and they would have a much harder time quitting. Trust me, i was 100% convinced that my life was going to consist of being a homeless junkie shooting up on oark benches. But now i have zero urge and i feel better then i did before. And i had a full blown 1.5-2 bun a day habbit.Do it while you can.. I’m 25 and now take 110mgs of methadone every days to get sober.   I go to my clinic every single day.    It’s not something you wantYes, definitely do it! Get help, find a group and a sponsor. Check the links on the side, but there are a ton of resources and advice, there are apps to track sobriety too.Please quitYou lost an arm and a leg to opiates! The pain of withdrawal will fade, but you’re not a starfish man. Quit now while you still have your life.[deleted]I think OP had compartment syndrome.  When circulation is cutoff for hours your muscles begin dying and breaking down in to protein.  These proteins clog the kidneys and shut them down as well.  That's why he needed dialysis.  It's similar to what happens when rattlesnakes bite people.  I had a friend do this number as well, but he wasn't able to turn it into a positive and get his life back on track.Narcan doesn’t work on cardentinal does it? My bf OD’d on it and they were narcaning him and it wasn’t working if I remember correctly...Man I am in recovery and im being pouty this morning. I needed to hear this.Felt like I was halfway between being asleep and awake. Just floating, I knew something bad happened but ar the same time I had no thoughts or sences. It wasn't like I went out then instantly woke up, I was there for some time, idk how to explain it.Not if they keep using.Untill yesterday I didn't know this is even a thing. Holy shit.
Feel terrible for these guys. Your own body weight and that's it.Good. I’m glad that’s your response so we don’t have to read about something like this happening to you, or read your obituary. You have your whole life ahead of you and can accomplish anything you want to.>How can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did your heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygen, i'm not being a smart ass i'm just wondering. I'm glad you survived.

i know, i'm like How can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did his heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygenThat confused me, too.I was getting CPR entire time at hospital, I had no pulse tho till I came back I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soCPRI'm so happy to hear this. I've struggled and struggled to be clean and still do. I truly hope the best for you.Over-dose. He took too much manAnother person from here lost both his legs from the same thingThere are times that we work on patients (cpr and medicine) for up to an hour and get them back. It’s pretty rare but it does happen.Buprenorphine. Its suboxone if youve ever heard of that. A long lasting partial opioid agonist that people use to get off other opioids. Keeps you from withdrawalYeeshLooking for someone to comment on this. 

Nobody actually cares if you’re sober or not, you’re only lying to yourself.High doses of Benadryl produce the same effect as datura.[deleted]CPRMan I'm on your side your brain can't go without oxygen for as long as this person said.  If you have organ failure from such a large overdose you would most likely die.I didOf pus from the infectionDon't be any harder on yourself dude. I'm here if you need anyone to talk too I'm 23 female never had an o.d. but been through plenty of drug related fucked up shit. Stay strong and keep us updated!I try, I've been doing this long enough that I understand that when someone goes out they're not necessarily dying so it isn't time to run away and worry about if someone's calling the cops or not or some other lame excuse about getting in trouble.  It doesn't take 30 seconds to check a pulse or put a mirror or compact disc to someone's mouth/ nose. More often than not common sense will tell if someone is in trouble or if they just need to recover for a bit. I will admit that nowadays that fent bullshit  got everything fucked up. Cold showers or ice on/in genitals wont work everytime and I've got no access to narcan so I've learned some other tricks. Just trying to take care of my own.I may be a bad person...Seriously what? Op said himself he used since this happened. I hate to sound cruel and im horribly sorry this happened to them, but if thats not the biggest wakeup call to get your shit together ive seen, idk what else would get a person to stop.Cheers, we'll be among the survivors

Why would my fent comment be justified to downvote?You weigh out a large amount with a scale then dissolve in X units of water, then try a bit, if nothing then increase dosage etc.

https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosingYeah it’s happening. I’m pretty much broke despite having a job.[deleted]Hey man how you doing? Just another reminder you changed a lot of people’s lives getting just one person (me) off opiates. Always here to talk. Thanks as always.Do you exercise or anything? I feel like I need a replacement for that dopamine rushExcellent comment, thank you. A lot of people on this sub need to hear this :)I needed to hear this. Thanks goose.I can tell you from experience that tapering off methadone is painless. I know there are many horror stories, mostly from people that rushed it, and it prevents many people from tapering. If you tapered down 2mg a week you'd be off in one year and you would experience no discomfort at all."Just quit" yes because that's how addiction plays out. Your comment is ignorantFuck you man. Thinking about it is the first step. Don’t belittle that, it’s a big fuckin step.You mean carfentanyl? Sure it does, might need more tho. Veterinarians who use it also carry naloxonrI could never imagine what you are going through but I have had some adversity in my life too. Maybe not on your level but I have learned to be greatfull for the things I do have and not angry about the things I don't have.
Holding onto anger is not good, it will only hurt yourself. You can never change the things that have happened to you, you can only change where you are going.
I hope that someday you find the solace that will release you from this pain. Good luck brother.That's crazy.Thank you so much. I have such big dreams and I’m going to accomplish them, I promise youHeart stopped, was getting CPR the entire hour[deleted]CprI don't understand how you got around needing oxygen to your brain as CPR does not provide that but regardless I'm sorry for what happened. I'm glad you are using it as a positive.

On a side note - do you experience any phantom limb issues?Yeah. I’ve been seeing these stories a lot in the last few days. It’s really scary.  I’m clean almost 50 years and when I was using I never heard  of anything like this. I’m wondering if the dope is just so powerful now that this can happen while nodding.  Stay safe.Ooooh ok. What's the difference between that and methadone?My thoughts exactlyWell that’s the crazy thing about this life we choseThere are a few reasons why medical staff would consider prolonging CPR- reason for arrest, age, and CO2 outputProbably got a pulse and lost it multiple timesThey didn't for me for some reason, I asked why they didnt I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soIf you look around this thread he has explained it several times. They were doing CPR on him for that hour and someone in the medical profession said that happens. I know it kind of blew my mind too until I read more.Oh damn, that's a lotUs please, stay safe. I thought Marciano’s was available everywhere. It should be.ProbMaybe maybe not. Comment was a bit in poor taste but mehHe said he slipped up twice since then. Which I mean I get the wakeup call thing but we are drug addicts it's not unreasonable that someone slips up once or twice and hopefully he stooped IV use. It does seem his shit is together he said he's on bupe now. Unless I'm missing somethingNot justified but understandable. Opiates are demonized but fent is treated as the antichrist. That's all I meant. Haven't ever intentionally used fent but I damn sure had it twice unintentionally. Put my dick in the dirt before I could clean up and woke up sober as a judge < 30m laterI'm 22 too, and on the dole indefinitely. It isn't the opiates that kill you in the end, it's the money.Good luck. Just remember that wanting to get clean isn’t enough to overcome this disease. You will likely need intensive therapy and medical support as well as possible 12-step fellowship. Don’t forget that opioid maintenance therapy is safe and effective too. Way too many people have died because they became convinced that being on buprenorphine means not “being clean”. “Being clean” is subjective, what you’re going for is stability across the different areas of your lifeman I wish you the best.  first step has been taken with your willingness to admit this even if just to reddit.

I was a high functioning oxy addict, but like OP said, it got very fucking dark quick and I was relatively careful - never even shot up.

lost all my money, eventually my job, gf went to court mandated rehab, then I went myself.  15 months clean, new job, new city - it can be done.  but man it's not fucking easy, i'm still trying to change my thought process.It's easier if you can maintain the right outlook.  Thats why people say hit the gym and shit, get those free endorphins any way you canFuck it do a lineyou should def exercise and you should def find something to replace the habit. a new hobby, a new sport, a new game, a new class, a new toy, a new goal - something to occupy your mind, especially in those two weeks where you're especially idle. and exercise will physiologically make you and your brain feel better too. forcing yourelf to exercise for 20 min. each day will do wonders.The few years I was clean, excercise helped a lot. I loved that rush.
What I found messed up though was that on subs I didn't get the rush. I just got fat.

So, if you can get it into your life, excercise is awesome for recovery.[deleted][deleted]And it kills the effects? It wasn’t working on my bf but by this time he was unresponsive and spewing pink goo out of his mouth like one of those high school science projects with the volcano.


And I **knew** it was spelt that way! I changed it bc someone else spelt it carfentinal and I got paranoid I was spelling it wrong lolI know you will.Statistically, Doubt itWhere is his right leg?If you're dead for an hour, CPR won't revive you.Yes at first, I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soMainly that suboxone you can be prescribed on a monthly basis and methadone going in daily for which kinda sucks. 

The reason for this is because suboxone is much less abusable I would say. You can abuse it but the high is pretty shity compared to most opiates as it’s only a partial agonist rather than full like most opiates are.Suboxone is an opioid block. It binds to the receptors on the brain, making it difficult to feel the effects of an opiate if taken while suboxone is in the system. I believe methadone is not a blocker but rather more of a craving suppressor . Suboxone supressee cravings we well. Methadone doesn’t block other opiates thoBupe is partial antagonist and methadone is a full antagonistIm not sure exactly all the differences. I do know that suboxone typically comes with naloxone in it, which is a chemical that will kick opioids off their receptors. Im pretty sure its just an anti abuse formula. I dont think methadone has as good analgesic effects either. Both have really long (24-48 hour) half lifes thoughYeah I know but its just really, really young to be going through that.No someone who SAID they were in the medical profession said that happens. it doesn't for a drug to cause him such a massive overdose that his organs failed he would either have died or would not be revivableYeah my butt cheek looks like I got in a savage ass knife fight lmao huge scars from the surgery[removed]Ya think?? Not even I laughed.Just last month he was in here asking how to best use fent saying he was a high tolerance IV user. He said hes slipped up sonce starting bupe. Which for all we know started last week.We are in r/opiates, I always got the impression people here aren't teenage idiots from r/drugs or r/kratom but actually down to earth open minded people like in r/stims

But there's always the exception that proves the rule lol. 

To be fair, an antichrist is just a new version of Christ, like the Mormons who believe Christ is American or something? Like how there are antipopes that people have chosen to see as the word of god rather than the papal pope throughout history.

Brian in Life of Brian is antichrist.

Uhhhh where were we? Oh yeah, fent bad ooga booga ban fent [new super potent opioid class appears]

In Europe fentalogues really isn't much of a problem, they're sold for what they are in nasal sprays usually. Sweden had about 70 deaths from fent in 5 years I think, 250/year or so overall deaths from drugs and we have one of the highest per capita in Europe

Also, >implying sobers are judgeHahaha it is often the opiates dude. The money just makes it super rough on the way down.Yeah the only reason I'm clean rite now (well on subs but I've quit subs before and i can taper relatively easily) is i ran out of cash. I blew through about 5k in saving in a matter of months, all while getting paid an additional 1k every 2 weeks. All that plus my ironclad tolerance made it totally worthless to continue doing dope. Now i’m extremely great full i went broke. It basically saved my life.No it’s the opiatesit can be maintainable. you have to get away from dope though and the needle. that shit will kill you quick. there are more natural options available. i plan on living as long as the rest of my peers, i just plan on doing it a little more pain free than them.>Just remember that wanting to get clean isn’t enough to overcome this disease.

You work for a rehab or something? Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.really? i jumped off at 2mg after several years and didnt have symptoms at all.I wasn't the one that did that what are you talking about? I dont useYes, it kills opioid agonist's effects.

Oh both ways to spell are correct lolYou must be living very low to try and bring others down like that[deleted] I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soThank you for answering! You're awesome.Yeah, I’m not familiar with any of this. Not any of these new drugs and pills because I last used H in 1970. This sub blows my mind. And no, I’m not triggered at all. I’m really glad I’m not in this scene any longer but I have great compassion for addicts.You're a dickOh, well I didn't know about any of his prior posts here. I only read this current thread and he portrayed it on here as if he's been on bupe since this happened,  with only one or two slip ups. Shrugs, idkGood luck with that. Everyone thinks they are smarter than the people who ODWishful thinking will be your downfallDealing with the things that cause you to self medicate in the first place is critical. The desire to be clean is important, but if you don't fix the underlying issue's that drive you to use, then maintaining sobriety is hard. Addict's don't have healthy coping skills, and once you stop using, you need to learn them. Drugs for many of us is our coping skill, and obviously, that dosen't work once you want to get clean.Sure, it can be. But for most addicts it’s not. If it was then relapse rates wouldn’t be so high. Of course addiction treatment isn’t one size fits all. Fortunately there are several options. Nonetheless addiction is a chronic disease and not engaging with any sort of treatment will not work for most addicts. Also it is very rare for addicts to not be forced into some sort of treatment at some point in their lives; there are acute and long term effects associated with treatment. There is evidence that suggests treatment has a cumulative effectDo you work for a rehab? Because "wanting to be clean is all you need" is the tripe they peddle with their NA nonsense.You must be ignorant to be offended by statisticsI do. Lol. Look at pic againNo -- the OP said he lost one leg, his left leg.  The guy in the picture appears to be missing both legs.And you didn't initially say this because???No problem! Someone still downvoted for some reason though �‍♂️That reply was incorrect. Naloxone is there for patent purposes and for anti abuse. It’s bioavailability when taken sublingually is vertically non existent. The bupe has a higher binding affinity than other full agonists kicking then off the receptors, not the naloxone which is a common misconception.IndeedIt's true, doesn't need to be fent either. When your tolerance is low from chipping you're at more risk too. I od'd almost fatally from morphine and oxy no fent, and 1mg of clonazepam.it's not about being smarter. i've had this conversation a million times. i'm in my mid 30s, i have a family, i have a job. i know what i'm doing at this point. i don't use street drugs or needles. i'm not looking to get high but for pain relief. there are many many people like me living a normal life on opiates. please don't pretend that anyone who uses an opiate will end up dead, unsuccessful, or in jail. that is one outcome of many.U can bro; pfff u just happen to live in the wrong country ; big pharma pushing em pills to people who doesnt even need it; songs bout it; clothings; its a trend to pop pills and do dope; in here we take it easy ; theres a lot of more ODs from benzos and booze than opiates because if u take some its recreational ure not gonna go and buy more the next day; they sell em perkys without prescription ; but everyone knows that one week and ure hooked; no H were i live ; people smoke opium and weed mixed; only if there is ; same as pills ( hydros, dillys, even fent) but all of us are aware of the degree of addiction; better stick to the sticky ; when americans come they all want those whole perky boxes hydros they even stay to live here for that; but yeah i guess is the place were u grow up and principles u learn in life; ive been dead from a benzos OD but opiates? Pfff who likes WD ; fuck ur veins up? Like damn u dont how the cartel is fuckin up the heroin with fent and as one of my aussie brothers said; they wanna die dude they just dont care; and im not saying it to blame people or make anyone uncomfortable but look around people are hooked ; doctors give em pills like candy; then u end up with the big bad wolf that brown rock u never ever imagine would be inside of you; and damn media goat ; big pharmas; fuckin rap songs ( talking bout perkys like if they were something like weed to fuck with; Actavis like if that shit wouldnt be on ur drink everyday after u try it) i like opiates; a lot but fuck i have a stash and havent touch that shit in weeks or months ; its sad im sorry bout ur story and i hope u realize how worthy ur body is ; it carries ur spirit; when u start to depend on a substance to live ; get mad with everything if you dont have it; or spend thousands realizing ure all alone with that needle; that aint life ; but fuck it ; just a message from someone who yeah i love drugs; i smoke weed; i take micro-dosing of shrooms or lsd ; all for the sake of well being ; gotta be one with urself pf course i smoke opium and weed; but i would smoke it everyday; i would die to go to a pharmacy and buy oxys ; etc; fuck that i wanna be free✌��� start thinking bout yourselves not making em people who dont care shit bout u rich; creating more monsters everyday ;  fuck the FDA the Sacklers ; Purduoom; how much karma they got how many lives they fucked how many futures they ended; and most important how many lives they already took�There are plenty of ways to reduce your OD risk to near zero. Most users aren't willing to do them.

Use test strips, don't mix opioids with other CNS depressants, and *always* do a test shot of 30mg or less. 

If you suspect your dope may have an analog not detected by test strips, you can always make a solution to get rid of hot spots that might exist.


None of these things are hard to do, but most people don't want to spend the money on test strips or wait the extra two minutes before getting the dope in their veins.

I also know many, many users that refuse to do a test shot because they "don't want to waste dope or a high".I'm on /u/mj0r 's side on this, to be honest. If you're cautious and not a daily user you can function just fine with very little trouble. All it takes is common sense and self-control.I'm the person who just got clean one day. For over ten years I was effortlessly clean. I was even occasionally around drugs -- piles of pill bottles at relatives, glassine bags at a friend's house,  finding drugs under my own bed -- and it was like being around broccoli.  I had no interest, no desire to use, nothing. 

What did I do to achieve this? 

Nothing. 

No NA, no MAT, no therapy.  

For years it was a mystery to me until I started learning about phenomenon like aging out and finding out how common it was.

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/

Anyway, it is possible to just get clean and all the people who hysterically told me to go to AA, etc., did nothing to help.  They just annoyed me. 

I am NOT saying it is this simple for everyone.  I AM saying it can be. If other people are helped with therapy,  MAT, whatever,  that's awesome. 

But it's not always necessary and in the case of therapy and rehab, it can be dangerous.  I've posted here before about being in an abusive rehab when I was young. 

There are many different paths to sobriety.  It's frustrating when people insist that any one thing is necessary.fuck coping skills. who needs coping, when you can cop!>Nonetheless addiction is a chronic disease and not engaging with any sort of treatment will not work for most addicts.

Look, NA and rehab have 90% fail rates. And addiction may be neither chronic nor a disease. 

I am very intrigued by the "learning disorder" theory.

https://amp.businessinsider.com/maia-szalavitz-unbroken-brain-treating-addiction-as-a-learning-disorder-2016-4

God knows we need new theories since the options we have now have such huge, unacceptable fail rates.

MAT is your best bet when it comes to mortality rates -- it reduces mortality rates in recovering addicts by 50% or more. 

>there are acute and long term effects associated with treatment. 

Yeah, I know.  PTSD. Found out the hard way., unfortunately.I never said wanting to be clean is all you need.

You shouldn't lie about what I said. 

As for NA, I am no fan of it or of rehabs or their 90% fail rates.I don’t work for a rehab and not all mental health clinicians advocate 12-step attendance. It doesn’t work for some people. Fortunately there are other options out there. Doing nothing is likely not an option for most people. When people prescribe things on a societal level they are looking for processes that are replicableLol I get it but you’re just being a fuckhead for the sake of itPlz look again lol I have my right arm and legBc? Idk man I just wrote from the heart not really getting into details like thatWell, so upvoted you to counter the downvote. Who would do that? I mean, what’s their rationale?Idk why people cant just chuckle and move on. I make the same shitty jokes. I woke up paralyzed once and people were mad at me for making jokes.. ABOUT MY OWN FUCKING PARALYSIS! Geez.>  I od'd almost fatally from morphine and oxy 

How much, if you don't mind my asking?> i don't use street drugs 

There's the difference. You know you're not getting fent, or worse yet, carfentanil.I wholeheartedly agree with you! Never cared for the "HIGH", just the pain relief. I'm disabled, and have lost quite a bit over the past few years since I haven't been able to work. Now I just pray my soon to be pain doc won't be scared to prescribe me the amount I need to function. Opiates are not problem, it's what you want from them that gets dangerous.Anyone using opiates to get high is at great risk of addiction and subsequently overdoses. If you’re using them as prescribed you’re pretty much going to be alright as long as the doctor tapers you off them if you ever decide to get off painkillers. If taken as prescribed opiates are a gift from the universe that has revolutionized medicine since their discovery.I'm a toss my story in.
My od was after using for many years, but after a long break. It was tiny, I mean tiny. Less than a third of a point, and I woke up on the floor surrounded by medics.
4 days in coma after that. Aspirated something into my lungs, was coughing up blood and drowning as I got to the hospital.

We all think we're smart. It has nothing to do with that.It's about being consistent. Everyone can be smart. I use heroin and a needle, been doing it daily for 12 years. Past 3 I've only done it weekly. Life is fine. Going on vacation in 2 weeks to the Caribbean where I won't have anything. I'm looking to get high. But also looking for pain relief, ain't gonna lie. Main reason I don't use H every day is because I don't want to scar my arms (anymore worse), and money. If I had the money like I did before, I'd use, no problem.

&#x200B;

But it's about being consistant in doing the things that prevent OD. For example, testing my dope everytime, always assuming I have a low tolerance, I never assume anything about the dope. Never mixing drugs (I still do sometimes, but very rarely and carefully). I use alone, and that soudns stupid, but after I use, I always go outside to the dog park, in the event I do OD, it's in public and someone (which nearly everyone who lives near me knows) can do something. It's not about being aware, it's about making it a habit.  


In short, respect the drug. I always treated injecting heroin like a medical procedure. I tell alot of people who ask me if I can get them some to try, etc. That this is no fuckin joke. This isn't 2005 where any joe blow can go buy a cap of H, and slam it and be fine. There's fent in them pills! There's NO room for error. None. It's like skydiving.Careful...it's like an avalanche..all beautiful and serene...til it breaks loose and destroys everything..You sound exactly like every addict I've ever known.U are right, i am one but for the sake of harm reduction ehhhh...exactly thisAh yes, common sense and self-control. Along with "willpower" and "wanting to get clean and live a normal life," the easiest cures we have for the opioid epidemic. I'm not sure why anyone didn't think of this before you did. You'd think all the mental health and medical professionals busting their asses on this problem every single day would have figured that out by now.


*tongue in cheek, because this is far and away the most ignorant and most dangerous view anyone can have regarding this problem.Don’t you think that everyone said this at one point?Dude, for almost 10 years I danced on that thin line. Unfortunately, at some point I fell off it and now I'm shooting 1 g a day. Its just like death and taxes, if you gamble with it....eventually EVERYONE will fall to it if you play long enough! It may take 1 person only a month to fall, but the next person is like me and it took nearly 10 years.....but everyone eventually falls. Unless they quit before that happens, its going to happen!Thank God this wasn't me, I love broccoli!I'm sober as well, after using drugs for 25+ years. Everyone's path in life and sobriety is different. That's great that it worked for you like that. But generally, it's not like that for other people, mainly the people who are self medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma. Those things don't go away on their own, they need to be managed and addressed. The person suggesting OP seek out support or therapy to help them deal with the things going on in their life was hardly out of line. Sobriety for most people takes work, it isn't "effortless". There are ups and downs, at times you struggle, at times you feel great, but for the majority it isn't something that just happens and your just "healed".Thanks for posting this. I thought I was pretty well versed in my understanding of the different theories about addiction and I have never heard of this phenomenon before.Thanks for posting this. I'm getting to this point. Older now, I use less and less every year. It's almost gradual how my recovery is coming aboutGood for you—sincerely glad this happened to you. I’ve seen it happen very rarely. Sadly though from my experience living among/working with addicts and all the literature (legit medical research) you are definitely in a very small minority. 
Very cool thoFor some it works to white knuckle it out but for others especially if their environment encourages them and there is no support mechanism or coping skills, will revert back to using. 

It is easier doing it with a group of people. Even here online there is support.Listen man I hear you. I was transported as an adolescent to wilderness therapy, therapeutic boarding school, etc. Still, the biggest problem with advocating “doing nothing” is that it’s not a replicable process. We have no idea why you were able to spontaneously recover. And since we have no idea it’s not smart to recommend it to people. Additionally evidence suggests that treatment may have a cumulative effectYou weren't a real addictI also think NA doesn’t work for some people, so I’m not sure why you think that’s what I’m suggesting for everyone. It does work for some people though so it’s at least worth checking out. If anything I’m upset that AA/NA have a cultural monopoly on the “addiction as a disease” model. Addiction can be a disease and there can exist plenty of other treatments, like as you suggested, methadone, to treat it. Are you still clean? That’s a genuine question. I understand that even if you’re not clean that that doesn’t invalidate the ten years you wereI tried NA when I was younger, and everytime it caused me to go out and use. I couldnt sit there and talk to strangers about drugs without it penetrating my brain and causing a definite relapse. There must be others like me.oh maybe i misread.> Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.

You did though. Are you going to really emphasize the “can” in that sentence?Doing nothing was the best option for me, eventually my use slowed down. :/Seems like you are too with your unnecessary aggressionBro, this guy is the lowest of lows, look at his comment historyYou wrote something that sounds impossible and clearly raised a lot of doubt among people.No idea. Someone probably didn't like something i said and went through my account randomly downvoting my comments. Or maybe its someone coming onto the opiates sub to downvote "junkies" 

People are weird �‍♂️Because being the one to throw punches at your own self is something entirely different from throwing punches at somebody else , a stranger at that, about a sensitive topic.Would like to know the answer, feel like I ODed on xr morphine and that’s why I want to kinda quit.210mg or so of morphine and 40-60 of oxy.My boyfriend ODd and almost died from carfentanil but ended up okay.

Then I saw that horrible movie Jurassic World 2 and the fucking **dinosaur** had to be put down by that shit. Now my bf thinks he’s bad ass cause he survived dino sedatives �ironic that you quitting was what caused you to overdose.If you OD your not going to make it outside to the park. It's usually pretty instant when IVingfor sure. you're just playing a bit more of a dangerous game but it's the same game. our lifestyles are probably quite similar, you just take more risk. the stuff i use is technically legal until you make it so i don't have to worry about the police. i don't have to worry about infections from needles. overdosing is nearly impossible. no obvious signs of use on the outside. so i have a little more room for error than you do but like you said as long as you are vigilant you should be good.my avalanche already crumbled years ago. i've been at this for 15 years. i had a lot of the same issues that people on here post about. i've learned and adapted. i'm not saying there is no chance of something bad happening but i take a bigger risk every time i drive my car. i know it's not the norm and most people will assume it'll catch up with me eventually, and maybe it will, but my life is stable and consistent. with the stuff i take i would have to try really really hard to overdose, i have narcan, i don't spend more than i make, my life doesn't revolve around the substance. as far as i can see, i think i'll be alright for the foreseeable future.okay, are they all in their mid 30s with a happy wife and kid? are they house hunting? do they and their wife both drive cars less than 5 years old? are they comfortable financially? if so, good for them!I can bs on that. All the will power and "wanting to get clean" and live a normal life doesn't mean dick to me when maintenance with kratom seems like an easier route to accomplish "living a normal life"   


Only thing my will power gave me, is the willpower to continue using heroin and not destroy my life. I guess to do heroin smarter.I don't really think that's true. Maybe MOST will fail at some point, but there are plenty of examples of people who consistently practice harm reduction and can maintain a decent lifestyle.LOL!! I needed that! ������

And so it IS true.  People who like broccoli actually exist! Who knew?!

Update: Who would downvote this? Smh.>I'm sober as well, after using drugs for 25+ years.

That's wonderful! �

>But generally, it's not like that for other people, mainly the people who are self medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma.

Oh, I've had trauma. One of the worst was a rehab I was stuck in when I was young.  I have PTSD from that.

I know what happened when I got clean doesn't happen that way for a lot of people. 

I just want people to know it can happen.  And that it does happen.  

>medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma. Those things don't go away on their own, they need to managed and addressed.

I agree. 100%

>The person suggesting OP seek out support or therapy to help them deal with the things going on in their life was hardly out of line.

I didn't think they were.  I am just very cautious when it comes to therapy because of the abuse I suffered. 

>Sobriety for most people takes work, it isn't "effortless". 

Again, I know this. Trust me, I was as absolutely stunned as anyone else. That's why I want people to know it can happen.  Doesn't mean it will. But it might.

I think in my case, it was a combination of aging out and my life falling into order. For once, there was a perfect storm that was good.

>Sadly though from my experience living among/working with addicts and all the literature (legit medical research) you are definitely in a very small minority.

I am also talking about legit medical research and have provided links to both the research and articles about the research. 

The research indicates I am really not in a minority. 

Read this article:

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/>For some it works to white knuckle it out

Omg. I've heard this before.  I didn't appreciate it then and I don't know. 

It's like you don't know what the word "effortless" means.

There was no white-knuckling at all.

NO WHITE-KNUCKLING. 

It was EASY. Effortless. Like someone flipped off a switch.

>It is easier doing it with a group of people. 

For some.  Remember when I said there is no one right way? It's not always easier with a group.  It sure wasn't for me. I didn't appreciate people assuming I was white-knuckling it when I wasn't. 

I didn't like having my truth utterly dismissed because it didn't fit some people's paradigm.>Listen man I hear you. I was transported as an adolescent to wilderness therapy, therapeutic boarding school, etc. 

I am SO SORRY that happened to you. 

Have you read Help At Any Cost? It really helped me understand what happened to me. Here's a link:

http://helpatanycost.com/


>Still, the biggest problem with advocating “doing nothing” 

I am not advocating that. 

>We have no idea why you were able to spontaneously recover.

Actually, we do. Check this out:

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/

>And since we have no idea it’s not smart to recommend it to people. 

I didn't. 

>Additionally evidence suggests that treatment may have a cumulative effect

Link, please.Oh, really? Please share your definition of what a real addict is -- and explain how you know I don't fit that definition. 

I'll wait.

The truth is -- my experience with addiction is pretty darn typical.  Here are some more links.


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/can-you-get-over-an-addiction.html


https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/opinion/addiction-recovery-survivors.html>I also think NA doesn’t work for some people, so I’m not sure why you think that’s what I’m suggesting for everyone. 

I never said that.  I don't think that. 

>It does work for some people though so it’s at least worth checking out.

10%. Yes, it's worth checking out.  But if it's not for you, andbodds are it won't be,  well, then, it's worth checking out. 

>If anything I’m upset that AA/NA have a cultural monopoly on the “addiction as a disease” model

I agree 100%!

>Addiction can be a disease and there can exist plenty of other treatments, like as you suggested, methadone, to treat it. 

Mmmm, the disease model has some things to recommend it, definitely, but the learning disorder theory makes SO MUCH SENSE to me. Did you read the link? Here it is again, just in case you didn't.

>Are you still clean? That’s a genuine question.

That's a tough question. The answer is.....I don't know.  I unfortunately developed an autoimmune condition that can be extremely painful.  I don't use any illegal drugs and have no interest in using illegal drugs.

But I do have my prescriptions.

Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences.  I don't think I fit that.

I definitely use my medication to feel better -- but Jesus! I feel terrible, so what am I supposed to do?

>I understand that even if you’re not clean that that doesn’t invalidate the ten years you were

You are awesome..I like you, man! �Oh, man. There are so many others like you!
>Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.


>You did though.

No. I didn't. 


> Are you going to really emphasize the “can” in that sentence?

Yes. I am. That's why I said "can be" instead of  "is."I did haha, it made me feel much better :)Too much time on their hands and a small mind.Its not a punch tho, it's a joke. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Heroin to get me through it, Content: , ups: 614, downs: 0Oops... it took wayyyy too long to get this. For me the weird part about being clean more often then not is taking a shit everyday like a normal human being. Not used to that at all[deleted]This took me way, WAY too long to get. I'm embarrassed for myself.:)I usually hate memes and think they have no place here, but I have to admit that this one made me chuckle out loud. Good one. AhahahahahahahaBeautiful.LolA meme is only funny when the picture actually has something to do with the textI dont get itLiterally when I was in impatient rehab I would shit everyday and think. My god this is weird, going everyday and there's no intense fear to use the bathroom and no pain when I do. This seems wrong.lmao same. Late here but getting used to eating every day/more than a couple times a week was hell when I cut off mandy. Have some 'friends' who felt the same cutting out tina. Goddamn marroon.Keep it up man!No matter what you think of yourself, you can get through it.  Do it for your daughter, please.

PleaseReread the meme. Hes clean because he showers, not clean from dope.

But good on you man, keep it up.A very top notch shitpost lol[deleted]The picture is relevant, the lil homie hates to shower and he's sad about it. At least he's got dope though.Nah, that shit is funny. And true. The shower is what keeps him cleanI just feel so dirty after doing the deed. I'm not used to that much poop all the damn time lol. Right? dude comments right away to make sure we don't laugh at an incorrect meme lmao sweet life!Not sure opiates is the best place to be making fun of people for being a failureNot really, just thought this particular 'meme', an animal making a sad face.. was a shit one.[deleted]because he showers, he doesn't do heroin. I logged on to reddit, clicked this sub - saw this so I clicked it. It's not like I sat there clicking refresh waiting for it... and while your making incorrect assumptions - my life is pretty sweet, thanks �[deleted]Opinions are okay.  Nothing wrong with having opinions.  But when you tell everyone else what's funny (or not funny,) you open yourself up to being called out as the asshole you're actively being.  Work on thickening up that skin a bit and laugh or not laugh at your convenience.  Hell, nothing wrong with even saying you didn't like it.  Just don't tell everyone else not to and you won't be ridiculed.  Easy peasy.  This concludes today's lesson of Not Being an Asshole.  It's a cute baby bear I mean what else would be more appropriate? I think it works better than a pic of a fucking actual heroin addict shooting up everyday and showering. Hmmm jus saying it's not that big a deal either way. yeah man, i think would've been mad funnier with a photo of a junkie in the shower shooting up.

or at least they could have put the bear in the shower. or made the bear a junkie. or something.I like dogs. Do you like dogs?10/10 prefer showers to methadone'My life is pretty sweet...' except for when someone posts a goddamn incorrect meme!I don't know shit about you or your life I was just calling it how I saw it in front or me. I think I accurately did just that, minus the misunderstanding about the excellence you piss daily, my bad!Ahhahahahahahahaaaaa, ohhhhmg, gimme a sec.....*i gulp down some water + hack*........*flopping heavily down in my chair, a mirthful smile upon my face, i grab my blade and lift it to the top of my smartphone*.......*with a shake of the head, i drag it through the pile of powder and scoop some into the metal cap i'm holding by the edge of the phone*.... laughing is a blessing especially for those who's dopamine and serotonin levels are inherently low - and seemingly require, whether as a byproduct of or the reason for no one knows, the use of artificial means to prop up the levels high enough to make it so that suicide becomes 'not an option' instead of 'well, that sounds like a fucking good idea'. so thanks for the laugh @completelyshitfaced!

1. memes are funny often enough when the text and photo don't match
2. sometimes that's the content of the joke - that they don't match
3. who the fuck cares??
4. fuck you, asshole![deleted]Yep, 2016. Where I know the difference, I'm just typing on my mobile and aren't all that concerned about the occasional grammatical error.Go home, you're shitfaced. But super concerned about a meme error.

Also, "aren't" is not what you want to use in that sentence. Ewwww alchohol, sorry we don't associate with addicts in this sub :PAwesome name. I think he meant to say "I'm not," but idk he's being all nazi over here.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Saw Fetty Wap on my way back from copping, Content: , ups: 613, downs: 0Did you say hey what's up hello?yo dont lie, hes your dboy. #fettycoppeddamn dats really dat nigga fetty waphe winked at you bruhfenty wapThey let niggas with only one eye drive?

Niggas got the Christmas i8 that's crazy lol1738i didnt think you could drive with one eye (legally i mean)cuz of bad depth perceptionI actually really want to hear his new song with tekashi69 Best pic ever posted on this sub Reddit.

DaaaamnFucking awesome NICEOh Its Lit fam[removed][removed]He kinda deserved to fall off the way he did. He isn’t very good and was a terrible performer.

Edit: yah I’m a Fetty hater. Anybody who has ever seen him perform knows he easily one of the worst performers. Shows up 30 minutes late to every concert and leaves early in 75% of them. It’s not a one off thing.[removed]Upvote this if this is dank. I am a bot and this was automatically submitted. Please rate.Literally who? Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door!Hahah classic! I bet he gets that all the time...good to see the man still rolling thru his old blocks, Fetty seems like a pretty straight up nigga, he just needs another hit to get back poppinYo for real tho imagine the shit he gets.. hahaWetty fap*You'd think it was from some "cool" hood rat story, deal gone bad or something... in an interview he said it was from conjunctivitis as a kid. :(He’s got like 6 kids from 5 women to pay child support for. Randomly took a picture lmfao Hahaha yeah I feed the homeless sometimes It's actually a ninja-turtle theme i8 but still dope i'm like baby girl hello?!My dad drove all the time. (Lost eye in childhood hunting accident) He could see deer way before the rest of us could. (We grew up in a rural area)  He also had a plane that he flew very illegally. I flew with him quite a few times. He was damn good pilot.Fetty's new shit is pretty fire and I'm a white dude from Oklahoma.Nah he was moving bulk my nigggguhYep. That’s him[removed][removed]Still so fucking rich that he doesn’t care what we think tho Fell off???  I guess you live under a rock this nigga is all over the radio.> Shows up 30 minutes late to every concert 

You've never been to another concert with any person/group that "made it", have you? 30 minutes late is actually early.Fuckin haterNjBad botSexybotIt was in that moment that Jessica realized she was not in fact, a "trap queen," and probably shouldn't have let her D-Boy nut in her.Fetty most likely doesn’t do H idiotI think letting your kids conjunctivitis get so bad they lose an eye is pretty hood.I give him props for not making up a ghetto story.poor guyUsername checks out! I can see it in my head as we speak. You copp, you're excited, about to get high, Oh look! Fetty Wapp! ::casually snaps picture while cheesing and keeps it moving:: LMAOOO LOL, that would explain his facial expressionAka myself

Ephasis on SOMETIMES. Because I need dope ALL the time. Feeding myself isn't always in the cardsOne of my flight instructors was blind in one eye and they let her get a license. In fact she flies for American these daysHahahah this whole time i thought one eye willie was from newark hahahah..my bad bruhhHahahah well im retarded i always thought he was from newark..im from jersey too[removed][removed]Contrary to popular belief, most artists are very prompt with their performances, and venues have time constraints they have to stick to as well.

Source:  worked & played at a bunch of different music venues my entire adult life.I went to a Guns n Roses concert in Philly 1991...they were notorious for going on late... plus, it was a crapshoot whether it was a good night or bad in terms of show quality, performance, and length. 

Anyway, show was supposed to start at 7:30ish. Soundgarden was the opener and they were AWFUL that night. They were off the stage by 8pm.....G n R didn't come on until 11:30...but damn, it was worth it.  To this day, it remains one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  Short of like Kanye arena tour that starts right on time, this is basically universal>D-don't criticize stuff I like

Why is everyone on the internet so thin-skinned?Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that DawgfoodMN is not a bot.

Not shitting on his parents, I’m sure they’re nice, but no kid from the suburbs loses his eye over damn pinkeye. Most of the time he doesn't talk about it, he just kind of wants you to assume it was some hood shit. Think he just slipped up one time during an interview. Probably too much *lean* and he let down the facade. Does shooting a twenty to some street kid to get u sum fire, count as feeding the homeless?Wow. Thought it was very illegal. [deleted][removed]Lol I'm such a noob I've been to hundreds of concerts and only the small-time acts have been anywhere near on time for the start-time written on the ticket. It's expected to be an hour or an hour and a half laterUnless Pearl Jam is playing. I think that's one of the funniest stories. He's bitching at promoters to have them get off the stage cause they drew most of the crowd. The promoters basically told him, "dude, that's Pearl Jam, you don't just ask them to quit playing."If it's a festival kind of thing, sure, timing becomes more important. I was referring to concerts where there's like one front band and then the main act and then you go home.Bad botLol the fucking bot of canned meat. Anti spam (canned meat) bitch I am 100% sure that perrycohen is an absolute cuck and hive a minded bot. Bad spam detector. You are spamGorgeous George got rekt.I like the user nameWhy downvotes? Do y’all think he does? �Wasn't pink eye.  He was born with glaucoma in both eyes or something. De wasn't pink eye.This would definitely be the smarter approach Hm.  You're probably right.It's illegal if he doesn't have his pilot's license [Yes.](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/et/31-34/mv/)Hahah really is pretty much the sameIf you're referring to the difference between a door time and a show time, okay.  Or the fact that the start time means that's when the opening/support act goes on (not the headliner), then okay.  But there are strict set times for ALL acts at all reputable music venues, from clubs up to arenas.  Always.  If an artist goes on late, it's them exhibiting diva-like (aka shitty) behavior...it costs promoters a shit ton of money when artists don't stick to advanced and agreed-upon set times...especially when the local crew is unionized (overtime/time and a half is EXPENSIVE) or noise ordinances are involved.

thanks bro. He don’t they’re trippingNah his parents got him some type of surgery or some shit and the doctors fucked it up .[deleted]
i'm talking about the time it says on the ticket.

Like " BLAH - 9:00" means they will start playing by 10, at the earliest.

Against, festival and multiple-act situations are different.[This Comment Is Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food))Spam is bae Of course you do ODB. God bless> I love spam

I love spamYou can obtain a medical with monocular vision is what my link states, how's it not possible?Usually the time printed on tickets (unless otherwise noted) is the time that the venue begins letting people in, AKA door time.  And in that case, you are spot-on, because doors are usually one hour prior to showtime.  More in-depth tix might state "doors at 7, show at 8" but not always.Spam> I love spam

> I love spam

I love spam

I love spamPerhaps it's different in the shows you're attending, but for the exception of some bar-level venues, the ticket will sometimes list an additional time for door, like "Doors at 8, show starts at 9" or they simply say "Show at 9" and the doors are open prior for people to arrive and take their seats, etc.

Here's an example ticket I found on the internet:

https://images.iacpublishinglabs.com/reference-production-images/question/29897795207a83ff9fc761f3642040e6/aq/700px-394px/purchase-concert-tickets-ticketmaster_30bfba1154701bea.jpgticketmaster_30bfba1154701bea.jpg

You can see it says doors at 7, then lists "8:00" elsewhere on the ticket, but if I were going to this show I would not expect the show to begin until 9.What is spam?

No fucking doubtI've often fantasized about being rich in the old west, just living the life in the opium den or at the saloon with all the doves passing around syphilis. And there was cough syrup containing alcohol, morphine and cannabis... �Now it’s ketamine induction. Apparently it’s curing suicide cases quite effectively Thats the worst part?Probably morphine since heroin wasn't invented till 1874.Interesting. Heroin didn't exist 150 years ago...  Not sure vibrators did either...  But i get her point lmao.My treatment is *still* vibrators and heroin.Did you just have a stroke?That sounds pretty fuckin good. How is it different now?I'd prefer some opium or morphine, but either way it sounds better than shitty SSRI'sYAY FOR HEROIN!!!Reeee PoooostStill funny. Got my upvote.I can

A priest and a rabbi walk into an abortion clinic when one of them stops and say "does this taste funny to you?"No way, really?"Give little Agnes 2 heroins and she'll be fine."friend gets it intravenously. she says its working wonders. gets it like twice every week! 
i wish my doctor would try it :/ I had ketamine infusions and it totally cured my suicidal ideation. It’s a total game changer. Didn’t hole, but got the nice drunk feeling while listening to music for an hour. The downside is insurance won’t cover it (off-label use) and it is priiiiiceyYa... If so, Im not really sure that she is depressed at all. Lol for real.  How about the worst part about depression is having fucking depression.  It sounds like she's essentially saying, depression would totally be worth it if i could get an RX for heroin.  Fuck that, i'd give almost anything not to have depression at all.  That's close enough to 150 years for meHeroin definitely existed While writing the title yeah, unfortunately.  Currently in hospital, wish me the best.Yes my title was actually meant to say "found this in r/funny". But I had a stroke while typing it and barely manages to hit post.   

Currently typing this with my tounge from a hospital bed.  Wish me luck l.You can what?Cannabis indica and laudanum was available in an ethyl alcohol solution as a cough remedy, it wasn't that high of a dose though.[Yeah, I went to the top posts in the Baltimore subreddit for this pic but it makes the rounds on a lot of subs](https://i.redd.it/zhwkh6fqthp11.jpg)I’ve heard great things. I thought I had severe depression and ocd. Turns out I was just a meth Xanax and heroin addict and once I got clean it all went away. I guess being addicted to IV heroin depresses you. 25 months clean now and haven’t had a bad day since like 3 months clean. That ketamine treatment though is fascinating to me. Used to just put me in a k hole. Yeah, Right?�Word up man, fuck this disease in its entirety..I reckon the worst part not being able to physically point to anything, not a splintered bone sticking out of my thigh, not a much higher than appropriate number of white blood cells in ink on paper.

Your children are fine, and they're happy. They're doing really well in school. They have an almost free ride to St Paul's Lutheran. And what the church doesn't pay for, I can pay for it. It's okay. I don't know how to reach you, your number is disconnected. If you see this, I hope that you know that everything with your kids is okay.

I love you. , ups: 594, downs: 0Ugh, this is heartbreaking.  

I hope that your sister is ok and she can find peace with herself.Damn this makes me feel like shit for all the times I've just shut off my phone and gone dark on my family for weeks at a time. Think I'll give my mom a call tomorrowThat's heart wrenching! I hope your sis finds her way back to you guys. 


And Emily, if you're reading this, you don't need to be clean to have a connection to your loved ones. I don't know anything about your situation and this might be off, but it's never too late to turn around and reach out. 




All this pressure that's been put on addicts and the stigma are really counter productive. In fact, if people love you (and it looks like they do) they will be ready to start a clean slate. You don't have to go this path alone. Mostly, people assume they need to be ready to get clean to rebuild connections, but having a social net and a life worth fighting for is a great motivator. Not that I managed to get clean, but I managed a lot of other things! Like getting a degree, working on my relationships with my friends, my mom and siblings - and even tho I'm far from clean (maintenance & using on top), I've managed to make progress in many other areas of life. That next step will be taken eventually. Or not. Who knows. But there's no need to put everything else on hold to prioritize the nigh impossible step to sustained sobriety. 


Wishing you and your family the best of luck! <3 



I hope your sister Emmy is okay. Sending your family positive vibes. You're a cool sibling. I hope you can reconnect with Emmy soon.I obviously don't know you or Emily, just wanted to say thank you for trying to get in touch or at least leave a message about her kids for her. It means a lot to see someone not only perform the act of trying to communicate, but also to have the content of the communication not be something that would fulfill expectations by being accusatory and degrading. 
  You mention in a comment that the last contact you had was the day after you took responsibility for her children when a judge removed them from her care. It feels, just based on that, that you have stepped up to make a horrible situation a little less tragic. Not having had contact with her since the day after that happened makes me think that she probably took the judge's decision really hard. It probably crushed her, I know it would have that effect on me if I had kids and had to go through forced separation from them. Thank you for demonstrating that you don't have to assume that people with drug problems are sub-human and uncaring. I hope that she feels worthy of your care, and not totally degraded by being told (whether rightly or not) that she is not capable of being a mother to the children that she gave life to. What a sad situation.Sitting here while my son naps on me, and this definitely made be start crying. I hope everything works out for you. She is lucky to have you.Love and support To be frank, I fucking hate people like your sister.

Thank God you stepped up for those kids, many children of deadbeat parents like your sister aren't so lucky. Love you tooBro this fucking hurt to read. Youre a saint for helping your nieces and or nephews man. If I saw my sister try and reach out to me I'd bawl my eyes out. Emmy I hope you see this babe. Just know your family cares enough to reach out to you. Because not everyone's family would do that. As someone who is currently ghosting on family and my dogbabies, I want to say she may just be working on herself to prepare herself to face how things turned out. Hoping that she is doing OK, and that she’s trying her best to get where she needs to be. Also, you deserve infinite appreciation for what you are doing for her and her children. I can assure you that they will all remember your altruism.  OP, you are an awesome person. I can feel the amount of love you have for your sister thru your words in this post. I have negative feelings towards parents who abandon their children but I'm so grateful that your sisters kids had someone like you to step up and give the kids the kind of love and support they deserve and need. It's even worse imo of your sister because I figure you would allow her to be in their lives in the right circumstances yet she doesn't even try. But as you said, that's most likely the best for them and they are the ones who truly matter in all of this. Keep being an amazing person and with someone like you being there for those kids, I have a feeling they're going to be just fine.This breaks my fucking heart. There is no love like the love of family. Sigh. I hope it works out. OP You're a wonderful person for taking care of her kids. I hope your sis finds this post and you guys get back in touch. Much love <3UghOP your an amazing person , I just want to say thankyou for everything you have done for those kids . I don’t know you but I do know you have a huge heart and deserves happiness I wish you the best of luck with everything , seriously your a great person keep it up ��. If you can pls keep us posted if you happen to find her..I wish to hear her story . & I’d really wish to hear a redemption story I know it’s a long shot but you never know what somebody might do . Have a good night..
                                                                  - MikeI'm glad those children have you in their lives. I hope your sister is safe and finds her way back into your life.My heart goes out to you and your family. 
I hope you both find a way back to each other on better terms � bless you for taking caring of your family too. this is beautiful.Crazy fuckin life story dude, AaaakwarrdEmily if you see this there’s still time to clean up your act. Sending love to everyone. Win the war,  not just the battle.  Call your mom. Please do it and not just say you're going too.

As a mom, nothing and I mean nothing is better than hearing your child's voice.  Trust me on this one.Lost my younger (19) brother back in 2010. Would give anything to still be able to make that call again. Don’t let petty stuff come between you and family. Be the better person and let them know you love them every day. Good luckYes!  I put my entire life on hold for years because I believed I had to be 100% clean to have any worthwhile relationships. It's not true. 

There are varying degrees to using. Reach out, Emmy. You may not be able to have the relationships you want right off the bat, but letting family know you are ok really helps them. 

Sorry kinda rambling. I hope you're ok out there.  I guess I understand her situation. I'm a recovering alcoholic. But I've been clean For five or six years now. trust me, I don't pretend to believe that alcoholism is anywhere near as terrible as heroin. But I've been there.

 Don't get me wrong. If she shows up at my house, I will call the police. (There's a protective order). I do want a phone call.Junkies abandoning their kids gives the kids about a 75% chance of becoming a junkie themselves. Speaking of, where is exactly IS my Dad anyways? That was a long trip to go get cigs.

Ah, abandonment issues...
People are assholes for downvoting this. I don't give a shit how much you like drugs. You can't figure out how to use drugs responsibly and take care of your kid? Then quit doing fucking drugs and take care of your kid because they are more important than you are. Drug addiction is a mental health issue.

Do you look at schizophrenics and think, *"Fucking deadbeat parent. What an asshole."*

No one wants to abandon their kids.

No one wants to pick dope over their family.

No one wants this kind of pain and suffering.

Come on man - I mean, really?Piss off.This is late, I know, but just send them a text.  They're terrified.  Just text them to let them know you're alive.  

I love you and I support you.How so?It's not even about cleaning up her act at this point, is what I'm gathering from his post.

It sounds as if her family just wants to know she's ok.[deleted]People down-vote because this sub is full of addicts who don't take responsibility for their own behavior and think using drugs is an excuse to be a deadbeat parent.

If you want to do drugs, that's cool.  I know I personally wasted 10 years of *my own* life being addicted to opiates.  But when you involve children, you're just a low life piece of shit if you choose your fix over the welfare of your own child.I respect your opinion but I don't think opiate addiction and schizophrenia is a fair comparison at all.  Addicts can control the worst symptoms of addiction with free will, I don't believe that's the case for a schizophrenic.

I don't deny addiction exists; I know it does because it took 10 years of my life away from me.  But I don't think being an addict excuses stealing from people, child abandonment, ect.  Thats just bullshit to me sorry.

I just want to know that she's alive. At this point, her kids don't really even remember who she is. And that has to suck for her, but at the moment, it's better for them.A mom[removed]Oh man, why didn't I ever think of that?

*Just stop using drugs!*

Shit - you've just revolutionized mental health care!

Man, no one is saying, *"Yeah, fuck my kids. Heroin is way better than those brats."*

That's what addiction means. To be so fucked in the head that you realize the shit is no bueno but you still keep doing it. It's not a matter of being a low life - it's a matter of being mentally fucking ill.
Couldn't have said it better myself, when it comes to kids, you need to be willing to sacrifice your vicesThis 100%. 

The moment you have children you agree to put their needs and wants above your own, that doesn't somehow exclude drugs for addicts. > People down-vote because this sub is full of addicts who... think using drugs is an excuse to be a deadbeat parent.

Really? You don't think it's because you said "I fucking hate people like your sister"? You've been here for four years and honestly think more than MAYBE a couple of outliers would agree that dope is worth abandoning your children? Come on. You haven't been reading the same r/opiates as me.

You mention your clean time... are you in a 12-step program? If so, I would encourage you to maybe write about this and share it with your sponsor. You've some step 6 & 7 to work on.

Nevermind. Now that you've clarified I agree with you. I'm sick right now because I'm putting my family first.It's more of an established psychological fact than opinion, my man.

The very point of addiction is that no, an addict can not control their symptoms through free will. That's literally the diagnostic criteria - that even though they know their actions are destructive they still do them. They compulsively use drugs even though they wish they could stop.

To say otherwise is kinda like telling a depressed person to just be happy. I'm sure they wish they could be happy, but there's literally something fucked in their brains preventing that.I'm so sorry, I really am.  How long has it been since you've heard from her?Seriously?

GTFO of here with your b.s. negativity.  It's not welcome at all in this sub or any other sub for that matter.yeah, jesus christ.  this is so true.  do you think i want to shit on my children's lives?  I'm fucking trying here.   i got 4 months clean, but i had 20 years not, which includes the lives of my children in their entirety.  I'm trying to be a good dad but i do still have a pretty gnarly addiction.  thank god my wife is clean.Rebuttal winsOpiate addiction isn't a vice. I wouldn't wish this shit on Satan himself.>  MAYBE a couple of outliers would agree that dope is worth abandoning your children? 

Huh?  What do you mean?  Those are the low life scumbags who don't want to take responsibility for their own behavior I'm talking about.

And no, no disrespect to working the steps but I personally got clean own my own.  I have no idea what the steps are and don't really care tbh.What I mean when I say "control symptoms" is with free will a drug addict can stop using drugs.  That is indeed possible, people do it every single day.

The worst symptoms of addiction come about when we use and using is technically well within our in our control and free will. That is an absolute truth.Almost a year. A day after the judge took her kids from her, and gave them to me. What the fuck do you think vice means?Perfect example of the different between people who work a program, and ones who get "clean" on their own. 

People who do it on their own are usually still pieces of shit, just without the drugs - or just without some of the drugs. smhYou are an angel on earth for taking care of them. We need more people like you, sending love and good vibes. Thank you for being you. Wow, what an emotional and horrific experience that must have been for you and her too, even if she seemed to not care or was indifferent because of the drugs.

You are a great and beautiful soul to have the love and capacity to care for those children, if there were more people like you in the world we all would be so much better off.  As a mother myself, thank you, thank you so very much for your complete selflessness and immense amount of love you've bestowed on them.huh? I'm a piece of shit because I'm against child abandonment in favor of using drugs?

Yeah, that makes sense..  Typical junkie loser mindset. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Funny Onion post, Content: , ups: 589, downs: 0"Getting these lethally addictive drugs into the hands of vulnerable communities across the country is just something I do from time to time for a little profit -- I can drop it whenever I choose", said Arcelis Pharmaceuticals CEO Paul Corrier, clawing at his sweat-drenched shirt as he insisted he could "quit in a heartbeat" if generating billions in revenue by misleading the public about the dangers of opioids ever got out of hand. "Sure, every now and then I'll launch an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at getting doctors to over prescribe fentanyl sprays, but it's honestly not a big deal. Seriously, it's fine. Just because I'll occasionally partake in making money off the devastation wrought by drugs hundreds of times more potent than morphine doesn't mean it controls me. "

Their articles are such a fine line between fiction and nonfiction. Let's face it, this is pretty much already how reality operates. �Ah shit i wish i still had it, i remember i retweeted one from The Onion awhile ago but they had some headline that said

EDIT:found it..

-Study Finds Majority Of Accidental Heroin Overdoses Could Be Prevented With Less Heroin-

BALTIMORE—According to a study published Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the majority of the nearly 9,000 accidental heroin overdoses that occur in the U.S. each year could easily be prevented if the victim were to take less heroin. “Our data clearly showed that, in more than 95 percent of cases, had the individual used a smaller amount of heroin than they actually did, their chances of overdosing on heroin would have been significantly lowered,” said the study’s co-author Natalie Czerbett, adding that the results were the same regardless of whether a reduced quantity of the drug was snorted, smoked, or injected. “While these findings are by no means a silver bullet, I think it’s fairly conclusive that putting less heroin into your body is a highly effective preventative measure against overdosing on heroin.” Czerbett suggested that further research was needed to determine whether heroin overdoses could be reduced even further by mixing the drug with less cocaine.I saw this on Facebook today and literally spat out my drink. Hit way too close to home in the funniest way possible. The Onion really is fucking genius. Pretty great. Anyone heard that podcast(might have been this am life cant remember) about the creative process at the onion? Super interesting. Apparently its super intense, the writers go in front of the editors or whoever is in charge, and one by one read their proposed headlines. The guy telling the story says that the editors pretty much never laugh and will simply say something along the lines of 'thats horrible' or 'very funny'. Im not recounting it very well but what i gathered was their very strict editors are a big part of the reason its so on point The onyo.I saw this on Facebook today and literally spat out my drink. Hit way too close to home in the funniest way possible. The Onion really is fucking genius. It's fucked up because it holds more truth than most "real journalism" about opiates. http://www.theonion.com/article/study-finds-majority-accidental-heroin-overdoses-c-51992That's gold Sounds interesting, any source?Fucking hilarious  so true I'm stealing prolly repost10/10 won't OD againI didn't think you could OD on weed?I sure can try tho haha @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Too true, Content: , ups: 582, downs: 0Yup and it pisses me off sometimes but we all know we are the ones doing it . id probably be pretty careful about customers knowing where i lived if i sold drugs. people kill people over practically nothing these days.The best are the ones who spend the money on guns and show you their guns then you get too paranoid to go back lol[deleted]Yea....full top row of gold teeth...lmao i know a kid with sickle sell and he gets a bunch of pills and i use to spend like 1500$ with him the first of every month then like 3 hours later we would post all these videos of shit he just bought on snapchat With a $600 a day habit my guy just bought a house. No joke. He told me he “worked hard to save the money to buy it”. He is lucky I don’t have some one cheaper or he would be back to the house. Hate this shitty fr like thinking bout all the money I gave my main dude damn ,, when I was doing Brown I didn't even have money for food or clothes but plug didn't even use and on FB he would flex buying new phones and clothes getting tatted up all time and shit, he was cool tho gave me a sub for free when I was sick :)No what’s worse is seeing a. Bad ass jaguar car  in front of the trap all I can do is shake my head because it stands out like a sore thumb 
    Flash lil much...haha[deleted]SighHow about growing your own poppies?Yeah, a bunch of shitty jewelry and random electronics lmaoI think money spend for drugs is more usefull than for bs like gucci stuff.. 
Yep it’s been a long time since I’ve actually met anyone in a house. It’s all meet ups these days. It’s pretty much safer than having traffic at the house. Risk of getting pulled over but better than getting a house raided. These days?They started this trend in ancient roman times. They always left the tags on their marble statues and purple tunics. or they want to wear it and return that shit cause they just spent $250 bucks on a Gucci t shirt, a fucking t shirt, maybe a little better quality made than your normal run of the mill t shirt but at the end of the day its a t shirtI never understand that either. Why the fuck would you keep a tag on something? It's ugly and in some cases uncomfortable. The *only* thing I can think of is they're wearing things they want to resell later and figure keeping the tag on it will fetch more money. Supreme and other hyped brands especially.Lol, I'm with ya on that bud, I'm gonna be 50 on the 10th, and when they started wearing the starter hat, flat bill to the side, ( as mines slightly U shaped & centered)  w/ price tag dangling , and gold starter sticker still in place on the bill..? I'd just look in wonder and hand over my 100$ bill and go about my biz, as he rode off to do the same...Oh well, to each his own,  I'm sure when he rode off , he had his own thoughts of myself,  lolLeaving the tag/sticker on a sports team hat is like this to me.  If you leave the tag/sticker on there that is 100%, undeniably left on for other people to see.  It isn’t for you. It is a choice made solely to impress others. So corny. I’m 21 and I’ve never seen anyone do this Leaving tags on clothes and stickers on baseball caps has been an urban AfAm / hood / ghetto trend FOREVER. 

The idea is to show off to other blacks and to signify to whites also. This fashion sentiment is left over from just after slavery when newly freed slaves earned their first wages and tried to showboat by purchasing fine wardrobes. 

Yes.

It is.  -___-

Back then (late 1800s), the Republican party supported civil rights for AfAms; the Dems opposed the concept. 

something something carpetbaggers 

I forget 

Since the early 90s at least. Theres a few different theories how it started. Buy expensive shit, leave the tags on, return it. Although I dont buy that, sounds like something made up after the fact. Like sagging started in prison to signify you're dtf. Just a story made up so people can look down on those who do it. Also some people think it's to show the product is legit and not a knock off/show off how much was spent. But I dont buy that either...it was just a trend that caught on. Sticker shiny, sticker stay on hat. wow that is awesomeGet it was tagged “work hard play hard ;)”Fuck me, 600 bucks a day. Pills? Cause i cant imagine someone spending that a day on like h or anything besides maybe leandont be jealouscause he bought a house... your 600$ a day isnt enough for him to buy a nice house (about 200k a year minus expenses isnt enough to BUY a house) youd be surprised how many people spend money as good as ur or more... if you leave hed take a hit but could certainly still afford the house> but plug

Hah. Yeah I was in jail and prison with a few people that said they would do it. All sorts of shit, pretty much anything you can imagine. It was mainly for heroin and crack or meth, and the stories were just crazy. 

I’ve lived both ends though, not on that, just being a straight up junkie to making pretty nice money from literally starting from scratch. It’s just the way it goes I suppose. We just do it to ourselves. [deleted]I've had both.   I had two main dudes - polar opposites.  One, I spent $$ with everyday for  a YEAR, STILL never saw his place.  Other guy was like a damn convenience store - sometimes I'd walk in, there'd be two dudes at the table, I shit you not , selling a fucking BOULDER of H. sittin on a scale... an AK-47 laying on the couch, poeple in the room next door recording rap songs, folks outside smoking - it was wild.  Dude was a one stop shop for any drug you could think of - and if he didn't have it, he'd find it.  He always had someone "at the door," like a bouncer, checking people in and out, whihc was gated; he also had cameras everywhere on the outside of house, "to prepare for break ins;" it never happened when I knew him, but it's been years since I've been over there.  or home invaded by drug seeking violent criminals aka the cops - tombos de mierdaand Guild tabardsMore like 500-800Or things they plan on returning back the store later for a refund lolProof they bought it instead of ripping the tag and stealing it. That and the price being high enough means it's legit. [deleted]Bro... No. Just. Only quiet time nowWhat are you 12 ?I don't remember this being a thing, like at all, in the 90s and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a thing in the late 1800s either.

Afaik it's something that got mainstream with affluent millennials, non-affluent people who did it before that mostly did it so they could return the stuff to the store after showing off with it.Could be heroin and coke easily. 600$ would probably have you shooting all day Oxy 30mgYou only need %15 down to buy a house. 600 a day is a shit load of money when a typical mortgage is only a few hundred a MONTH. he could easily buy a house making 600 a day from just one of his customers. Are u 12 ���I never said I was, and I take responsibility for my actions, I live a totally different life now. What I meant was id be out there miserable stressing, stressing shit, lost my job, almost lost my family had no car. Then id meet up, dudes in a nice ride with 22in wheels, loud ass system, wearing new clothes, probably ate dinner every night, and gets laid. My problem was that I saw the bigger picture for my self, and decided to make a change. 

If the shoe was on the other foot, id have a hard time selling shit like dope, knowing that people were ruining their lives over it, I'm not a Philanthropist and I'm not going to do anything about it, it was just my two cents.U was at the trap ! LmaoAnd epic wooly mammoth vendor mountsI spend some money on some nice designer expensive type shit, but spending that much on a t shirt to me just makes no sense, like its a fucking t shirt, and im not gonna spend that much on a t shirt then wear it with my stupid ass broken in Levis jeans lol

just seems really dumb, all these hype beast kids who have no money in their bank accounts but they just HAVE to walk around in a $1,000+ hype beast designer outfit.... sometimes I see these rich ass asian kids walking around in balenciaga shoes or a MCM backpack or some shit and I so badly wana follow then and rob the shit outa themThat's also a possibility lolThis.  This is the exact reason. Thx alot man. Well being as I'm turning 50, not a whole hell of alot, on the partying side anyway..Working on sobriety these day's ..I think the kid's are taking me to Long Horn Steak house..So I can beat down a fat New York strip I suppose..I'm grateful tho..I could be taking the eternal dirt nap..lolShowboating and signifying == crucial to poor people worldwide since the dawn of man. Leaving price tags and stickers on is just the AfAm flavor of it. For example, back in 1990s NYC, stickers were left on flat bill baseball caps to prove authenticity.

(Old money does not have to brag about how new and expensive items are. Old money often values antiques and understated fashion.)
I remember it in the 80's and 90's.Bro it's time to try heroin. You could cut that amount in half at minimum. Or get on methadone and spend next to nothingYou spend six hundred... a *day*?

I mean, you do you. But like, I could literally live on $600 a day. Damn, dude! Lol. Congrats on your financial success!maybe. you got me there. still tho i doubt he bought his house only thanks to you.Haha. It appears that way. My minds humour age anyway. I hear ya.Basically, except he was the only house on the street, so it was kinda secluded like there weren't a bunch of randos standing around outside slanging everywhere - this dude was the dude *those* guys *came* to lol.  I felt bad cuz the first time I went over there I thought I was fixin to get jumped or something cuz it looked so sketchy, I texted my friend, who was like "nah man, that's his *house*" lol. :/ !!  Gotta live it up while you can mfs die everyday People of all walks of life like to show off, how they do it just varies. Some people of lower-economic status do like to keep tags in clothes to show off when they finally get a little bit of money. Hence the tags on clothes, the bling, and the stickers on baseball caps. But it’s definitely not confined to African Americans. You have plenty of white people who do the same or who buy the car that’s worth 3 times the value of their small, dilapidated home. Middle class folks, too, like to show off. Some do it with expensive watches or maybe with that well-places Ivy League sticker on their car or the ubiquitous Harvard sweatshirt. Even wealthy people like to put out signs of how rich they are to compete—are you following the new esoteric trend? How many seats does your private plane have? How big is your yacht? Etc.  No plug.  I am obviously a successful business person (not bragging just a fact of discussing an expensive habit) and I don’t really run in those worlds. I have one plug and I stick with him. Could live pretty comfortably, that's like $219,000 a year.We all get stuck at the age we start doing drugs I'm super imature too so is whatever lolDont...that's so fucking stupid. I'm a successful "business person" as well. Learn TOR and buy online. Or fucking quit jesus christ. You have good health insurance talk to a dr. and get on subs. But honestly, if you're intelligent enough to be as fortunate as you are you can network with some docs to prescribe you pills. That's insane man.
Wow... 600 a DAY?!?  even if you're paying a dollar a mg (which is a gyp, imo), that's 600 mg, or 20 30s??  Umm... I guess it's possible...  BUt yeah, as others have said:  yo could cut your costs in half (or better) by switching to H, or, as mentioned, try methadone.  I've never heard of a 600$ a day habit on just opiates.  Never.  And if you're paying more than a dollar a mg, you're getting screwed (and even that is high, imo)Yeah, 600 a day is a pretty nice living wage lol.  I could live on less than a tenth of that lolOh I am there and have gotten sober a few times.  I am about to try again but my issue is going from these oxy (really fentanyl) to subs. The half life on the fentanyl is 3 to 4 days of hell.  I will get there though. Besides the money I am sick of the life. I know I am getting screwed but I am to lazy and don’t run in the worlds to get a new plug. You ready to hear the ultimate screw job?....$40 per 30mg. I used to spend $125-$250 per day on my habit. And that was light spending considering what sub were in. And that was only because that’s what I was limited to by what I make from work. I could have easily did $600+ a day too if I had the cash to back it up. But I got tired of dropping that amount every day so I forced myself to be happy with $60-$75/day initially and now currently on a $40-$50 once a day with plans to halve that again in the coming months. Got tired of handing over a thick stack of 20s every other week so I dropped myself down and forced myself to be happy with the small buzz once a day. Sucks, but it sucks less than handing over that big of a wad of cash for sure. And it takes a lot of willpower to not buy more after work or whatever and sometimes sleep suffers. But you gotta control yourself, definitely. Especially when you’re hiding that kind of habit from work and family.I was literally in the same boat. Same drug of choice, the means to buy them etc. Get a high dosage of subs. Cut it into .5 or 1mg strips and after 24 hours start taking them slowly. Start with the .5, if you go into PW. Wait it out. With such a small dose itll be 30m to an hour. Take a larger dose of subs. Slowly increase. All PW is - is the bupe kicking everything out of the receptors. 

You got this man. Good luck.Jesus. I live in a small town hours from the nearest city so you can imagine the prices in my area are already marked the fuck up. Yet I can get an oxy 80mg for $40. That’s nuts. $40 CAD at that. It’s $25/6mg of Hydromorph here. $125/30mg. Expensive. DNM or find a new plug with the amount you spend. Never mind about switching to H as these guys say. Sure, you’ll save half initially. But your tolerance will grow and you’ll be spending that same amount on H in the long run in no time. Or you need to just lower your daily intake to a strict amount and just be happy with a once a day normal dose and stick with it. Drop your tolly by taking a tolerance break. Save your cash. Of course, all easier said than done and it’s your money and your life. Good luck bud. I was paying $100 a bundle for 10 .1 bags. I'd do that in 6 hours and get another. I got a connect for 200 a G and I did that in a day. Asked for 2 he's like no way you can do that much. I said no I can't do it all, I'll save a bump for the morning.Yeeeikes.  Man... that's ...  wow:(  You *really* must be a very, very cautious person!Oh, definitely.  Yeah, when I was using like that, a half a day, minimum, which got down to ~ $60 a day.  But for sure, when I had my druthers, I woulda used triple that, easy.  So I could imagine a $200 per day habit, easy - especially if you had the funds, even another two times over from that - but 5 - 6 hundos a day?!?  Either you're gettin gyped, or.. idk.  That's exterme.  

But beleiev me, looking back, I used to be in amazement at myself that I was able to come up with so much cash ever day lmao.  It was sad.  Fucked up thing is, even though I'm not doing that now, I *still* struggle to pay the bills and eat lol.   @@@@@@@@@@ Title: And I would’ve gotten away with it too if the suburban kids didn’t OD, Content: , ups: 581, downs: 0Seriously fuck anyone who cuts xanax with fucking fent.

Fucking retards.And that's why I only buy my xans from plugs wit scriptsHas anyone considered maybe they just used the same press to make fake oxys then made a batch of xans and didn't clean it good#ThishappenedtomeAre xans even worth taking?I knew it that bumbling bastard made me itch when I took the bars. good thing I took my scooby snacks in moderationtitle gave me a wee giggleRIP LIL PEEPChrist. I feel bad even upvoting but that shits too good lmao It don’t make any sense to me to press a Xanax pill with fentanyl.

They’re not even in the same class of drugs. But hey people are putting fentanyl in literally every thing nowadays He can't do that, shoot him or something!I just lost a closw friend from college to a relapse after many years clean off dope. They are suspecting it was a fentanyl overdose. This makes over 25+ people that I have lost since 2009 from opiates and its fucking ridiculous.LolIt's one of 2 things, either accidental cross contamination, or they put it in the bars as a cheap filler and as a secondary way of keeping customers hooked on their particular bars so they don't stray to another source, as they are hooked on 2 chemicals not just xanaxFuck anyone who presses bars period. But yeah. Sometimes it’s plain fentanyl. No alprazolam. That’s dangerous too, because people will have benzo withdrawals. Rip lil peepTrue but the person buying them should always test their shit.YesIf your resposible with them and never drink on them especially with no tolerance. Major blackouts and doing dumb shit is why.Xans are never worth taking Bro they’re puttin fent in the coke these days. Everything. These people just wanna get people hooked and have no clue what they’re doing. I was in Camden county jail in jersey and talking to these corner dudes and they’re laughing about it just randomly mixin in fent and seein what happens when it hits the block...”fiends droppin” is a joke to them and brings more businessStill so dumb.I dont believe at all that they would use it as cheap filler when they could literally just use an inert substance as filler for practically free. The only thing that makes sense to me is to get em hooked on fent.is Fent. really that cheaper than China benzo? shit costs like 90 bucks for 500 bars darkwebHonestly alprazolam is one of few great drugs to press. Alprazolam powder is cheap, comparatively easy to get and it has a much wider range of safety. Well compared to any opioid that is.

I wish someone would figure out how to make bathtub oxycodone.Nothing wrong with presses man, but fuck anyone who advertises them as pharmaLol you would never see a real bar again if they didn’t have pressies. 90% if all bars are pressies. I prefer pressed bars to pharma, and i get both 1mg footballs prescribed, but i also can buy 4mg presses for 5$. If i buy a pharma bar i still pay 5$ and only get 2mgs. I try to stay away from buying bars though i always end up with a slight habit. Though around christmas i bought 8 presses and 2 pharma, i know they were pharma because no one pressed those new Y 2's and had 8 green hulks that are pressed at 4mg even though sometimes i honestly think its closer to 5. Lets just say they lasted me a month i dont take xanax to get barred out more for legit anxiety or hangovers although im trying not to drink anymore,drinking is not worth what it does to my body plus ive kindled so much a weekend bender and i get withdrawl feel like shit until the next thursday. Alcoholism is fucked.Exactly. And jesus christ I imagine the odds of getting a poorly mixed batch of pure fent passed off as xanax would be pretty high. Especially if they're the kind of retard that's cutting their shit with fent in the first place, I wouldn't trust them to properly mix a batch.I bet fentanyl would stave off withdrawal pretty well in someone that doesn’t have a opiate addiction.

Not defending the practice, just an opinion.It's a sad world we live in where we can't trust our dealers not to kill us with the drugs we pay them for. It's just bad business to kill off your customers, but nobody looks at the bigger picture. They just see immediate profits and dont give a shit about long term investments.Yea that shits fuckin sick honestly. I was a ice kinda guy, but I did have a love for opioids. But when I was using ice there was rumors that people were putting fent in that. And I was like “why tf would someone mix a very potent opioid with a very potent amp” . Shits astonishing, and for any of y’all still using bro, stay safe out there � Fent in xans is for the most part non existent, this whole fent xan thing had been completely blown up by the media but no one has stopped to actually think about it, first off putting fent in xans  just sounds retarded on multiple levels, number one it would cut profits significantly, like by 20x and anyone with the intention of doing this is clear out for money grabbing and losing profit is not a characteristic that youd expect, secondly they are addictive on their own an extra boost from anything would just be unneccisary much less fent powder, 3rd it just doesnt make sense from a pressers perspective, i mean bars are already small grained so use of extra equipment press it is already required to make evenly dosed bars so fent being even smaller granules would be much harder to press without making bars have massive hotspots and cold spots. Aside from all that people who take bars and oxys are a pretty similar demographic and a lot of them take em together, i believe since a lot of oxys are fent pressed that many of these cases get blamed om xanax when alprazolam is found in their system along side fent as is what happened to lil peep, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/police-crime-lab-tests-identify-seized-pharmaceutical-drugs-as-being-fake%3f_amp=true there were seizures of these oxys in the area at the time roughly of the lil peep concert about a month off, and unsuprisngly on the list of drugs he had takin it was stated mbox 30s were part of it, this im pretty sure was the main event that sprialed media sources into creating other news around "fent laced xans" as i never really saw articles over it before which wasnt even a fent laced xan event, the more likely option of why people say they tried fent laced xans or said they know they go around because theyre friend had a couple bars then completely got slumped the next day is prolly due to a different epidemic thats also going on where most of the bars pressed are actually 4mg now, they could be taking two blackikg out or just getting slumped and preaching about it being fent xans, which seems likely since about 90 percent of bars people get in bulk are pressed and almost all pressed bars are 3 or 4 mg granted the impurities in chineese made alprazolam vs pharna might mitigate some of the high dosage not all of it and they are still taking a dose thar they might not be famailar with before if they are used to pharma, the more likely cut for bars people are getting are cheaper alprazolam alternative rcs like etizolam or fluroalprazolam which is more potent than alprazolam and only requires about 1mg to be stront feeling of that and since they are not the same substance but took less and got more fucked up then usual they may have thought it was fent due to everyone preeching its common, eitherway in the end you should worry about it too much as if it is happening its not very popular at all.Fiends dropping=Customers dropping=money dropping. Possible manslaughter charge too if linked back to you. They sound like geniuses. There's a big enough market for fent, just sell it as such.It isn't dumb. Cruel? Yes. Bad business? No.

They get more overall profits from addicted customers, so, they don't mind losing a few.Dunno about it being a cheap filler, but I would guess it would make the users think they were stronger than normal?

IDK I'm no expert, and I only rarely get or take benzos.Idk. I like the ones my pharmacist gives me. It’s also astonishingly easy to get benzo scriptsI tried H while CT WDing from diazepam. By day 7 I felt like I was going insane with psychosis. I had next to 0 tolerance then as well. It was maybe my 3rd or 4th time buying a G of H (which used to last all week dosing everyday) with a few months break. Thought an opi habit is probably going to be easier to kick if I can get through the acute phase... i literally couldn't function even though I was really high on H. I guess that's what happens when you abuse gabaergic substances for like 10 years straight.Totally agreeFacts but it has happened. I 100 percent agree but still, be carful. You don’t wanna be the one unlucky gal or guy...... or maybe you do but hopefully ya don’t Logically, yes. Morally, yes. But I’m talking corner boys in open air drug markets in the hood where these dudes don’t know you from the next. Where people hear there’s OD’s off a certain batch, they flock to that corner in drovesI swear to God if I ever get a pressed xanax cut with fent I'm gonna find the dealer and he's gonna need all the fent he can get once I'm through with him.I’m saying on the street most people don’t know anyone with a scriptPlease give pointers. All my docs seem reluctant. It was incredibly hard for me to get my 10 Ativan a month script... And I actually have anxiety and panic disorder.Ya i get 90 10mg valium and 30 1mg xanax a month but have to see my dr everymonth. My dr would rather me on benzos than drink the way i do. Although i do not take 3 valium a day more like 1 maybe 2 on a bad day. Im usaully fine with just 1 valium in the morning and if i have a panic attack ill take a xanax. They say 10mg valium is equal to .5 xanax but i dont beleive that at all if i took 40mg valium at once im going to be way more fucked up than if i took a bar or 2mg. Valium is a great under rated benzo for anxiety and many other things. Ive tried my fair share of different benzos in my life top 2 are valium then xanax, also depend on situation i guess 1 valium in the am and im anxiety free all day. It took me trying out ssris and all tht other shit and a few drs. To actually find one that realized im one of those people where when im not on benzos or dont have them as a back up my quality of life diminishes and i start drinking instead to self medicate and basically destroy my life with alcohol.For you. Can't get one to save my life.Familiarize yourself with symptoms of panic attacks and general anxiety disorder. But especially panic attacks, Xanax is a quick-acting, short duration Benzo so it’s supposed to be used on occasion for quick relief in emergency. If you gp is reluctant try a psychiatristOr you could say your a alcoholic and you need them to stop drinking for a while thats what worked for me. Although my dr is cool and knew of my drinking problem i was basically honest with her about a terrible relapse and shes been hooking it up. I dont drink anymore either so it definitely works. I’m in the same boat. My doc wouldn’t refill my Ativan script because I couldn’t come in every three months after I lost my insurance (lost my job). I finally went back yesterday and he made me feel like I was just trying to cop a script. 

Like.. wouldn’t I ask for something better? He had prescribed them them to me previously for panic attacks and nightmares (I have the most extreme terrible terrible super vivid nightmares 3-5 times a week). 

I mean.. I am an addict, but he doesn’t know that. And I don’t abuse benzos and I don’t think I look like an addict either. Aghh. He pissed me off so bad. That's how I got my xanax script as well, alcohol was about to put me literally in the dirt.Damn now I feel lucky to have a doc who gives me a benzo and addy. What a champion but holy hell did we go through a rough time. Dude straight gives me Addy 30mg IR from Concerta because I said I want something different and shorter acting. He mentioned it the previous time and I straight told him and he basically said, “Here find another doctor.” After my script ran out and I was trying to wean off hoping my insurance would give me another doc. They didn’t and sent me back to him. We had no real dialogue for two months but kept giving me the stuff. Actually still does till now and he’s just like “how’s it working or how you doing on these meds? Same thing again?” Umm yes please and I’ll show myself out, take care. “Uh huh.”

That’s basically it and I just scrap the Zoloft honestly. Only thing is how you doing? Good days and bad but I’m managing. Here and there get bummed but not bad. Okay let’s up the Zoloft. Sure thing doctor. God I been on benzos for years, opiates and now I’m going on like 5 months of Addy. Good times... to be an addict I was prescribed Ritalin for depression, once. It helped the depression, but I couldn’t stand the side effects. That's a risky strategy because it could backfire with the wrong phrasing. My experience was more or less the same, to a degree. My doc, who I've seen for years, knew that I had a huge problem with alcohol and thinks benzos are a lot alike and was afraid I'd treat them the same way I did booze. So after a year off alcohol she finally started me at 5 tablets a month, then 10, but anytime I request a refill I get it. So realistically I'm able to get 20 tablets a month. But I'm trying to get something stronger for the heavier panic attacks. Ativan is great cause it's functional, I can take it and still work, drive, talk to people normally, etc. But sometimes I have to take 2-3 tablets and that's a lot when I get so little.I cant take ativan im allergic to it weird i know. Ya man alcohol is one hell of a legal drug. Ill straight drink for months straight all day long still work and people cant even tell unless they are also a alcoholic.Make sure you do taper off adderall when you do, the loss of energy i had after just stopping after about 6 months just 20mg a day was terrible i didnt want to do anything. This was years ago too when i was younger and i bounced back faster but it was like i couldnt work or do anything. Ended up quitting my dead end gym job because of it which was actually a good thing though. Pre work outs werent even cutting it after 6 months on adderall. I could be different but heard others complain of the same symptoms. Ya my dr is just cool im honest with her and she helps me out alot. I couod see how that could go really bad lol.[deleted]That’s what you think Thanks and yeah my last mini binge wasn’t as bad. The ones before that though? Holy shit I wanted to sleep then just lay down for a week straight without movement. That saying about doing MDMA then having “suicidal Monday/Tuesdays” is spot on. I recently found out like a week ago or two that thanks to the stims sub which btw is a fantastic one. Shed light on the effect of making a person with depression worse after the fact since you’re essentially draining your dopamine and serotonin couple that with oxy and Valium which is nice with grass just adds another dimesion. Unfortunate yet interesting you mention working out. I had a killer six pack and now I still see my abs but not like before. I found out early on that another person mentioned. It doesn’t eat fat per se but muscle way more. Hence why protein and healthy diets with plenty of hydration is a must. This is coming from a guy who weighed 130 for 5 years then got sick and as a side effect gained almost 60 pounds at 5’7 which is stupid high. Changed my diet and started working out dropping it all and then some to 122-125 with definition and a core I can show off and no lie I try to since I have always been a tiny bit vain. I weighed at one point 112 pounds with no working out or nutritional diet on Addy. I haven’t had a craving for sweets since I decided to better myself, but now I’m eating stuff I never usually do. Then again everyone says just eat any god damn thing or you’re gonna die. Meaning I’ll get sick or messed up. My labs once showed my kidneys, liver and thyroid being elevated due to the Addy. I made sure to drink more water and eat at least before a binge and my labs are normal again. Weaning is a thing I can’t do especially in regards to my oxy since I suffer from chronic pain and I’m technically considered disabled yet you’d never know and some of my family doesn’t even know entirely either. The oxy and Valium carry physical depends which I say is far worse but given my history of suicide, depression and drug use the Addy also carries a sorta heavy psychological one. Yet I can take breaks from it and I can’t re up on it for a few more days, now two and I been out for nearly two weeks. Meaning my tolerance isn’t gonna be there and I better get more landing gear because knowing me I’m gonna go ham again a bit with it. I love doing stuff on addy especially playing video games when it’s late at night and normal people have lives or sleep lol

Oh my weight is back up to 121 now I believe as I been eating a bunch of random shot though I’m being more mindful now if sweets, fatty stuff and nutrition. Working out seems like the first time I tried running when I was a dough boy lol 
Cigarettes don’t help either though tbh Just ativan or lorazepam. Unless you know me sober most ppl cant tell im drinking. Im a better person sober anyway.Ah yeah that sounds familiar. I’m off it two years with a few hiccups here and there but I am definitely all the better for it.  Smoke a metric fuck ton of weed now so must look at that soon. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: What have I become?, Content: Me and my roommate were eating strawberries out of the basket they came in from the store. Before I could take the first bite he said " woah dude you have to wash those first" and I had to remind him that 2 years ago we were shooting fentanyl laced dope in a super 8 motel with a needle we shared with a prostitute., ups: 574, downs: 0Hahaha. That's hilarious. I've asked myself the same thingLolol everybody has their little codes and morals that they live with.

It's kinda like not giving a fuck about buying a $2 cup of coffee but pondering all your life decisions when it comes to buying a $2 iPhone app. �What happened in those 2 years that you can share with me to get it thru my thick, insane, selfish, stubborn and ultimately I guess just down right fucking stupid self so I can get off this hamster wheel. Before I die.I always have the same response when my friends talk about shit like "shouldn't be breathing in that air" or "you know thats got toxic chemicals in it?"  


Yea and 3 years ago we were cramming our noses every night with whatever looked like cocaine in a bag and sticking dollar bills up our nostril.I think about this daily. 

My old girlfriend and I have been seeing each other after a 5 month hiatus. We just got back from a holiday in Peru.

She made a comment on me eating a weird meal, I never even used to eat vegetables.

My response was “I used to eat meth”Maybe, the award of an opiate rush outweighs the dangers; and, by the same token, the extraordinary ease of rinsing strawberries outweighs eating a mildly dirty strawberry. Same universal principles at work.This is awesome.Yeah but that shared needle wasn’t going to give you cancer. Pesticides obviously can and will. 

PRIORITIES! 

/s

Yes I realize what you’re saying. Was also amused by this post.I went to a rehab years ago where my assigned task was washing dishes. Pretty rarely, someone would complain that a spoon was still dirty. Without hesitation, the lady who ran the kitchen would scream at them; you'd use that spoon to mix up heroin if you were still in the streets, wouldn't you?! They would never complain about anything kitchen related ever again lol.Does anyone else smoke cigerette ends when they're plum out of money and need a smoke?

I consider it building up my immune system from hundreds of peoples germs. I never get sick. My white blood cells are on high alert 24/7....my dearest friend....OP, I laughed pretty hard at this! Love it!

I basically go back to the list of drugs I have consumed when I have a, "I dunno, should i consume this?.." thought.

The answer is always yes �You've become someone that cares about themself.My buddy that was homeless living in a car with me would share rigs with me and whoever he needed to if we didn't have enough but was always super weird about drinking after someone else out of the same bottle/can/cupLmao I love this! I'm in the middle of a snorting bender after 4 years clean from opiates, and I gotta say this heroin life is boring now.Yea I always remember in rehab people would say oh smoking is bad for you and those people would be like bro didn't you smoke meth up until like a month ago?i used to do the same thing and be that person. but after shooting dope and reusing my needles more than i liked to admit to, i always tell myself ‘ive done nastier shit before’You've gone absolutely mad! You degenerate savage you.

r/madladsHave to leave a comment so I can see this on my page. So cute, bless.It's the devil you know, right?Pesticide doesn’t get you highI get it but I never wash my fruit anywayslmfaoo this is on pointLmao that analogy too realI have a personal policy of never paying for anything on the internet.

There's more than enough free stuff.> It's kinda like not giving a fuck about buying a $2 cup of coffee but  pondering all your life decisions when it comes to buying a $2 iPhone  app. 

holy shit lol i need to keep that one in mind while budgetingBut you're washing away all the flavor.![deleted]I've only ever used sterile spoons and proper water. In the UK they give you everything you need for free in a pack in most pharmacies (Any size needles, spoons, ascorbic acid for breaking down #3 Heroin and alcohol wipes)

However, I have seem impatient people use water from terrible places to mix up.. puddles? Dude, just wait 5 minutes or ask any bar or restaurant for a glass of water.. even McDonalds will give you a glass of water in a paper cup if you ask. Just don't get it and make a beeline directly for their toilets or they might get suspicious. Especially if you're in a group of people all looking sick and sweaty!Oh yes. Although I take the tobacco out and roll it. I mean, gum disease is *contagious*, dawg.Haha.  I was at a friends place one night and he asked if I wanted to go to the bar down the street with him and his roommate for a quick beer. I thought it strange because he doesn’t drink and money is tight right now for him. I said sure so he , his roommate and myself went to the bar and each got a beer. And then went to the place in the outside bar where we could smoke. That’s when I saw his roommate going thru the ash tray picking out butts he could smoke later. That was the whole purpose of the trip. I mean his roommate really did want a beer but he also wanted to get a bunch of butts he could take home.  I was literally sick to my stomach watching him smoke one. I had a whole pack of cigs that I insisted he take. I’ve done some gross things but I couldn’t smoke butts left  by a bunch of random people.Everyone I know

Goes away in the endI mean... just cause you used to do stuff that was horrendously unhygienic and gross, does that mean you should just say fuck it and always do everything in a gross and unhygienic way? Never too late to change ... or something.What is?I heard agent orange gives you a nice buzzYour flair = 275 $uicide?word lmfaoooI have a personal police to.

The bar down the street actually started pouring water in the ashtray lolThis is sadly way too relatable to me. :/ living the heroin lifestyle. Everyone I knew from the old days, is dead.

"Pulling up" = getting gas


"2 min" = Waiting to reup himself let's not forget "omw" = "i might decide to show up at some point between now and next Tuesday"My guy yesterday said "omw" and 11 mins later was in my driveway!! YESChange 5 minutes to 20-30 minutes and 10 minutes to 45 minutes - an hour. I’m almost there = just leaving the cribThe “dboy” posts are my absolute favorite!!! Love that you guys post them �"Leaving now" = may leave today. Maybe not. Don't call cause I won't answer.Here= 85% chance it’s todayThese posts make me so grateful for my dude. This shit might happen once every 3-4 monthsGot my first ever gold from this post. Thanks stranger! 

Also I’m really happy with all the comments on here and it’s turned into a great post. Y’all the real MVPs This is why when I used to use, I always went to my guy. “Oh your out Xmas shopping? I’ll meet you at target” lol

Although sometimes waiting is inevitable, waited at jack in the box for two hrs, dgirl kept saying in a minute every 20min. After two hrs she was like just come over (it was a freaking block away!). I asked why didn’t you just let me come thru from the beginning? Oh I don’t know. I was nodding. Lol trueeee[deleted]I'm at the light. Umm, ok, after waiting another 15 minutes, I begin to wonder which light and whether it's in the same state. Pretty accurateMy adhd! *say something* = *lie*  
Insert Pikachu meme here-Yeah on a good dayThis would be incredibly on top of things for a dboy are you serious? “5 min” = 1-2 hours away loli feel bad but i guess i have been pretty lucky with dboys the longest i have had to wait is like an hour or two and that's rare (usually waiting for them to put a package together) maybe happens once every few months. they always meet me within ten mins of my arrival to the meet up spot but usually under five mins. they don't like either person waiting around because it arouses suspicion. my heart goes out to those of you that have to wait a ridiculous amount of time. :/This is the reason I am so happy I just show up to the trap motel now and knock on the door to get my shit. Sooo much better than waiting around and way better prices.that's ghetto-timeYep. I always add 4 hours to the time when my dude says he’ll be ready. That way I can actually do something else with my day besides waiting around. Hasn’t failed me yet."Where you at?" = Coming from another state after the re-up.That here I come bullshit always got me.Unrelated but that "Here I come" shit is the best one. You pull up to the gas station then your dude texts you here I come. Next thing you know you see dude pullin up on this little ass bicycle he just borrowed from some little ass kid on the block. Just very funny times lol.You shut your mouth with that positivity! HahaIn traffic = 1-3 hours

Leaving now = Turning my phone off until further noticeAccurate. When mine would say 30 min i knew it’d be a few hours. I'm here = At the Mcdonald's drive thru, will be there in 20 mins.same with my dude he always on pointSame here. I appreciate the dboys that their business as a LEGIT business and don't fuck around. My dude now is always waiting for me when I pull up to his place, I legit never wait more than 30 seconds before hes outside, usually hes out there waiting for me. The longer we sit around waiting = more chance of getting caught, and he knows that. Why would he want his money going to jail? Just wish all dboys thought like this.same here and only because i caught them during a reupI agree completely. The only issue with the dope game is they know for a fact that we WILL spend the money no matter how long they make us wait. Sometimes it works to straight up tell them you have other dudes but they usually have enough costumers to say fuck off. It’s stupid. 

I used to travel for work and the most legit business oriented dealers I’ve ever come across were the Hispanics out west. Those dudes had actual operating hours and had a whole detailed system for hustling. Pretty cool I know that one for sure. There’s a shell gas station near our meet up spot and his answer is always “passing the shell”. Even though it’s only 3 blocks from the spot, it’ll take 10-15 minutes usually. Lol you are such a loserMost of my dboys are the same way. Now I have dealt with my fair share of waiting. Especially with the cartel but my main plugs are almost always pretty legit on time.But despite knowing better, there's a tiny sliver of naive hope inside you that this time will be different.[deleted]Yep I waited so long at a spot one time that eventually a dude that lived on the street straight came to my window asking what the hell I was doing on his street. I had my GPS running for this exact possibility and told him I was waiting for a friend to send me directions to his house and that I’m not from here. He walked away finally but  I called my dude and told him that I’m finding somewhere else to meet up because waiting so long almost got me in trouble. Eh, that depends, if you're copping in the hood, then they know there's no shortage of other dealers for you to go to. Even then, sometimes they have a particular stamp that they know you're looking for so they'll still take their time and proceed to dick you around. Sometimes a motherfucker just has to wait. Maybe he's pushing his car? Yeah my dude is pretty legit too. But I’ve definitely had bad ones. Had a dude legit try and argue with me when I told him I’d been sitting there for an hour. Had text and phone calls to prove it but he was having none of it. I think I quit using him after that And it never isEverytime yeah my guy cuffs me 10g if need be I'm lucky though single grams from my guy is only 65 everyone else around here charges 100 I've been blessed lolThe best part is when you pull up on the block and are obviously waiting for drugs so you have the runners coming by your window shouting out whats good. I am always too paranoid but it always happens and I cant help but think why don't I just grab and get the fuck out of here already.And wait we do. I really don’t even get that mad anymore and he really doesn’t have me waiting too often. I have another guy but it’s a slightly longer drive and it’s not really any better. So for me it’s worth waiting a few minutes to deal with someone who I have a decent relationship with. He’s usually actually cool enough to tell me when he’s eating or has another run somewhere else. I’ve been with him for almost 2 years now and was pretty much part of his come up. He keeps people loyal by being on time and honest. Probably. What’s funny is I’ll tell him them I’m pulling up to the spot and he’ll tell me to let him know when I get there....umm dude I literally just said that I’m pulling up. But they’re so used to lying that he thinks I am too. He wants me to let him know when I park. So I’ll hang up and call him back immediately to let him know that I’m officially parked. Dboy antics are some shit for sure lol That's what's up.  And when I do tell one of my guys that I need to call someone else because they're taking too long and I'm in a rush, I've had them say ok, go ahead, call me later or something. And then I'm like, wtf, where could they have been and how far? Were they even planning to serve me in the first place? 

And then, all calling another dude might do is just reset the whole process and potentially take even fucking longer. Yeah, that shit is retarded, I just told your dumb ass that I'm pulling up. Not to some random block or a fuckin Wendy's, but to your crib, the place I come to every day that I said I was five minutes away from when I called you five minutes ago, brainiac. I swear, some of these dudes are a cunt hair away from being straight retarded. My dude sounded like he was having a fuckin stroke today, then gets mad when I can't understand him. Then he's like, nigga! and continues to mumble something incoherently. Lol, I hate this fucking lifestyle. Happens way too often to me too lol @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I saw this and thought of you all, Content: , ups: 572, downs: 0"Per-co-cet? I think I heard about that on the news!"Yes!!!! I always was like I've tried Tylenol and ibuprofen and then they would say let's try some Percocet and I'm like
Ok I've never had that before!! Wink winkUgh. I need to get health insurance. I'm actually starting to develop fairly significant back pain. Though the addict inside of me can't figure out if the pain would be easier to deal with if I didn't also want the pills to get high.

How I wish I could buy oxys OTC. What a magical world that would be if I could get the medicine I need and the inebriation I crave just by walking into the store. I wish I could just be an alcoholic or stoner.this made me laugh way harder than it should have.Whatever you think is going to work doc, I'm willing to try just about anything at this point.What doc? You're going to prescribe me enough narcotics to put down an elephant. Well I guess we could give that a try!This meme needs to die now because I've said those exact words everytime my pain Dr. has increased my RX over the Years! WOW. Peeps love their memes here. I guess it goes to show that despite our unique sense of community and togetherness, deep down we are all filthy, childish, meme-loving regular redditors!

ps i upvotedWhat you gave me before didn't really break the cycle of pain. Do you have something with less tylenol in it? Haha seriously. Even though my background's in chemistry, I always make a point to stumble over drug names like it's the first time I've heard it. But Tylenol upsets my stomach, do they make it without that?I was going through gallons of vodka like water before I got hooked back on the good stuff. 

Alcohol has too many calories ffs, add in any chaser, and your asking to gain weight.  Plus you always feel it the next day...

I tried switching to weed. Even bought an expensive vaporizer because I didn't want the smoke. It usually just made me feel stupid. Wish I was in a weed legal state cuz I've had amazing weed before with an awesome euphoria. So I know theres strains.

Honestly though theres not really anything that can repalce opiates :pAmen to that. Weed is legal where I live and I can't stand the stuff. And I can barely drink due to migraines. I have a pretty fast metabolism too so I'll probably need to take quite a few a day to really feel them- uh I mean to really help with the painCan you boof this??Have you met Meth? zYour new lord and savior for not feeling tired the next Day?   Or the next...Or the next......Or, well, you get the picture.I was an alcoholic for a quick minute and that was the only time in my life that I've gained weight. I have a super fast metabolism but I actually gained like 15 pounds in a month or two from drinking a ton of beer. I noticed when I could feel myself jiggling going up and down the stairs. Yeah I feel the same about weed, though it makes me anxious and overwhelmed on top of the stupid. But same about the legalization. I'd like to try out some different strains and see I can find something that fits me. My state will probably be in the last 10. We just recently got medicinal through and it's a very short list of conditions.What's with all this hating on weed?? It's a magical plant. There are strains out there for anything and everything you need, if you dislike one side effect or two odds are there's some weed out there without it.  Besides that, it compliments opiates wonderfully, and I vastly prefer it to cigarettes but enjoy smoking something when high so it's a pretty ideal fitumm does saying this actually work?? hahahahI got lucky.  When I was about 10, my neighbor kids, one is special now and the other is dead, stole a beer from their parents fridge, and hid it in the field behind our houses...... On a 100 degree day.... I can't even stand the smell of beer.  Their the same pair that kept me from smoking, same way,  stole some cigs from mom's purse.Some of us just don't enjoy smoking weed. I'm not hating on it, but anything you get here is going to be anecdotal. It gives me anxiety. And I live in a legal state and know there are other strains, just doesn't do it for me.I mean, I don't hate it if other people use it - to each their own! I've smoked a bit when I was young, but was never crazy about how it made me feel (just dumb, sleepy and hungry), had a bad experience on some edibles about a year ago (thought time was skipping backwards and I was losing my mind..lol!!), and I guess I just kind of gave up on it.

One thing about opiates is I don't find it effects mental clarity/ability to think (well, pre-nod off anyway). I feel like weed actually is lowering my intelligence while I'm high. 

I may try a _tiny_ amount of edibles again to help with migraine pain/sleeping, some people have recommended it for that.Fuck no, they'll give you the ol' "well let's just try out this dose first, we can always raise the dose later if we need to."*Dr stars to write script for opana*
"oh but Doctor... I don't IV"More like "well let's try the get-the-fuck-outta-here you stupid drug addict" �In this case, wouldn't it (this approach) work in the long term??Lol yes but opiate users and patience don't really go togetherThis is taking it too far imo. Doctors know what to look for. That's just one too many tell tale signs. Couldn't you just use (what ever you use now) and work on your GP (doc or whatever you call 'him/her' in states) as your 'side job'??Yeah it takes a while and its expensive in the beginning but can be worth if you are patient. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Solid Medical Advice, Content: , ups: 571, downs: 0My old next door neighbor was a cop.  He tried his best to work with the local petty criminals.  Once he was on the phone in his yard saying "I don't like arresting you either!  Have you ever tried not doing heroin?"
Unsigned... Of course. STOP BREAKING THE LAW, ASSHOLE!!Not better then my advise It's in all caps. You better listen to him OP! All my medical records are riddled with notes like opiate dependent, canibis dependence, benzo dependent, known cocaine abuser etc.Lol if only life was that simple.LmaoWell it's not a bad idea.Is it just me or does it sound weird when someone says "take heroin" it just sounds weird. "Take".. I prefer "do". **DID THE DRAKE VOCALS COME IN YETTTT**[deleted]I got this same medical advice after my second OD �It should say "man the fuck up"I've been to that hospital several times. Back  when I lived out there.....that piece of paper makes it sound so easyRight, because it's just that easy.Yes, this is what my last discharge papers say as well. HahahaNah.checks outOh I've seen this paper too many times lol. Yo I lost it at this! LOLI framed mine. Lollol my best friend went to the hospital and his paper said: diagnosis: chest pain from chronic methamphetamine use. Special advice for dylan: stop smoking methamphetamine. Haha I got the same advice typed up a few years ago from my doctor Wow ... That honestly makes me mad *for you*. 
I'm so sorry that happened to you .. >Have you ever tried not doing heroin?

OH MY GOD.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THIS?!?!?

IT'S SO SIMPLE!

THANK YOU KIND SIR! THANK U!!!!!!!!!11Yeah, it was probably one of the nurses playing passive-aggressive fuck fuck games. Underrated comment of the dayto BANG THAT SHIT?With all the fent related hospital visits and over doses on the rise they probably can just click paste when typing and that's what comes up lol. [deleted]Same here, it sucks. I don't like having that stuff written down anywhere concrete.

I've been off dope for over a year now but still drink quite heavily and use cocaine (mostly contained to the weekends) and I had to go to the doctor's recently for something unrelated to substance abuse. When the doctor asked me if I drink and how often, I was trying to think of a reasonable amount of alcohol to tell him (since I do still drink like an alcoholic on the days I do drink.... i.e. Memorial Day weekend was basically a 3 day party of being consistently drunk and horrifying everyone at the party) and j was like "hm maybe 8 servings a week?" And he wrote on the form that I have issues with abusing alcohol! I was thinking how does someone even actually get drunk with under 8 servings, and isn't getting a good buzz the point of drinking???polysubstance/pharmacy addiction or another popular one is the borderline personality and narcissistic personality disorder. so much of my file has not been discussed with me, kind of defeats the point in some ways. This was my first thought too!�That's Doctor Captain Obvious, M.D. to you!  Doctor just having a little humor.Well it is legitimate medical advice...[deleted]It's pretty solid medical advice. In general, it's pretty good for your health to not use heroin. Definitely no need to be so sorry or mad for him.Exactly. It's not the RNs job to tell us how to livetip top advice, like "stop being so anxious" and my personal favorite, "stop being so depressing all the time""fuck fuck games" Came here to post this, was my instant reaction. Nice. DuhNot going to the doctor is a foolproof way. Its one of those things you can only hide for so long. Unless you have an ignorant doctor or just get super lucky with circumstance when you have visits but IV drug use is bound to end you up at the doctors ER or clinic at somepoint.A lot of us depend upon our docs for our drugs. Like if i didn't hide my drug abuse from my doc where the hell would i get my drugs from?...I don't live in Baltimore, i live in the most expensive illicit drug country in the world by a mile. So hiding my use is essential to live.Yeah antisocial personality disorder yadayadaI mean it would be negligent of of the doctor not to recommend this.But your username!I guess I just overreacted a little or took the post the wrong way lol. It's just not that easy to "stop taking heroin". [deleted]u want sum phuk?The most solid advice to ever exist Also if you end up in an ER for a plethora of reasons, they 95% of the time run a drug screen if they take a urine sample. Then if you've tested positive for anything, even if you don't admit to it, doctors will mention it (or not) and put the instructions in your discharge packet in order to cover their liability and bill more! If you tell a doctor you smoke, the doctor can put in their chart "gave 5 minute smoking cessation" which puts them in another billing category, and all they have to do is say "don't smoke" or put in "quit smoking" instructions in the packet. [deleted]OZZIE OZZIE OZZIE OI OI OI

(if ur a kiwi i dont know what ur chant is)Loyal to the foil. I'm fucking dead.  for his health it's a good piece of advice to get off heroin. 
It doesn't say how easy or hard it will beIve had several friends and family members who are nurses, and they are hardly brain dead. They became nurse's because they genuinely wanted to help people, not because they couldn't cut the mustard at medical school. You obviously dont know what your talking about.Also, the bachelor's program for nursing is the hardest bachelor's degree to obtain. (feel free to Google it). The masters program is even more brutal. 

Also, I don't think you have a good grasp on the true meaning of co-dependency. Maybe just a liiiiiittle phuk?... Because i have a legit chronic pain issue i just abuse my meds. Don't shoot so how would he ever know. Better to prescribe to someone who needs it rather than be suspicious of every patient and then have people with legit pain issues kill themselves. I'd have killed myself a dozen times over since CP began if it weren't for opiates. Life quality was zero and the pain so intense that it was unliveable. But yes, the majority of CP patients end up with addictions, it's just the nature of the beast and I'm pretty sure docs know this but there isn't any other option.Lmao, nah Aussie man haha.[deleted]Yeah get a good grasp on the true many.My ex had a genetic disorder called hereditary multiple exostoses or something like that. Basically she constantly grew bone tumors. Can you imagine how painful that would be—constantly having your bones scraping and stabbing your muscles, ligaments, etc.? She was on Nucynta for a while and she recently had to upgrade to Dilaudid—I only know this because she called the pharmacy that I work at (probably forgetting that), asking if we had it in stock. Why she jumped straight past Zohydro and Kadian to Dilaudid is beyond me. But she once told me that she had Dilaudid once and refused to take it again because she knew that she'd abuse it. When I found out that she has a prescription for Dilaudid, it worried me a bit but she never wants to hear from me. Our breakup wasn't the easiest by any stretch of the imagination and I really really hope that her significant change in medication is completely unrelated to that.where abouts in ozIn each of my stints in detox, it was always the RNs and nursing assistants who were the most sneeringly judgmental of the patients. Noticably moreso than the MDs.Yeah fk CP it's fkn just the worst. I mean if she is she's taking Dilaudid she's almost certainly addicted, but rest assured being an opiate addict with CP and a script is better than having CP and no opiates imo. Won't be all that surprised if i use for life. Melb U?sydney bruzLame. Every Aussie on here is from the harbour or Radelaide.

This morning early into my shift we got dispatched to an overdose. We got there and he was in his late 20’s, his girlfriend and mother was there both sobbing. My partner dragged him out of the restroom while he was soaked in his own urine and not breathing. He began pushing narcan while i prepared a bag valve mask to start breathing for him. He came back to his mother and lover crying over him with angry officers asking him where he got it while he is covered in his own filth. As per typical he didnt talk to police and refused to let us take him to the hospital.

We are all human and experience ups and downs in life, life is short and we all have a story to live.

What they go through to just do their job is mind blowing. The amount of good they do and lives they save is acknowledged but what they go through doing it is not talked about enough. 

Unfortunately in this city there is a lot of EMS & Firefighters committing suicide due to PTSD. Just yesterday a 25yo EMS worker who lived around the corner from me killed himself. And last year there was several in one month. 

I know this has nothing to do with your post, but just as you care about the anonymous user out there, know that the feeling is mutual.Thank you for your kindness, and everything you do.I shared a room in rehab with an EMT alcoholic. He was in bad shape with heavy PTSD. We stayed up all night and shared stories. The shit that came out of him was to this day the darkest shit I’ve ever heard and it was all related to his job. Thank god for people like you and stay safe and try to remember to keep your mental health in check as well.thanks for this man, really. there have been days when the kind words of a random person on the internet was all that stood between me and a bullet to the head... or a relapse when I was trying to get sober... which based on the number of friends I've lost are often one in the same.

thanks for the work you do and the passion with which you do it, because I'm gonna go ahead and doubt that it's for the money.Should tell the cops to fuck off if they're angrily questioning someone who was basically just brought back to life.I'm on this sub as a pain management patient.  Used to take pills recreationally, but now I need then to function.  I've never done heroin but I can relate to what it's like to be dependent on opioids.  Thank you for your post.  It really means a lot to everyone.  

One thing that really bothers me is how the police behave.  A lot of people are scared to call because of them.  If you could please protect your patients and make them feel safe from the police you'd be making us feel a lot better.  I know I feel safe around EMS workers when I've been in a situation with them.  The police are supposed to protect us from danger, not get angry or threaten and arrest people going through drug addiction.  

Take care, be safe and thank you for everything you do!Don't think your in my country but still appreciate you sir.

Drug addiction comes in many forms from the ivy league adderall popper's, the construction workers reliant to manage their work related injuries to the stereotype walking dead junkies.

Behind each one is a personal human story, often incredibly sad story's.. Life and the world told them over and over we don't give a shit about you. 
Stories that lead them to addiction  but there still people. You should never look down on them because it really could be you! Or your loved one just like that.. Iv seen it.

Anyway we need more people in the front line services and in general like the OP.

We can bring the change! Anyone with any intelligents knows drug policy has failed and its time for radical changeNot all heroes wear capes, this one drives a big red fire truck. Thank you �you saved my life!! would've been two years ago  tonight!! thank you very much!!This is one of the best posts that I have read since joining Reddit. 
It’s nice to know that there are professionals out there who do care about addicts.Thank you. This post made me feel a little bit of hope."with angry officers" you should tell the cops not to be dicks and maybe they will get more cooperation. waking up to cops being assholes isn't going to get that person to open up. thank you for all you do i know being a first responder isnt easy.911 dispatcher here. Seconding. Please call if you need us.Thank you for saying this <3 I thought most public safety officers despised addicts.  I overdosed once, and now I'll have 3 years clean this Christmas. Some of us do change, even sometimes the ones you see every week, I'm sure you have your "regulars" lol.  We appreciate you.  Know that your effort isnt wasted bringing us back over and over again.  We do recover, and we're all creative individuals capable of change and success.  One time I heard a cop say that he believed an individual should only get to be narcaned 3 times before they had the right to let the victim die.  I'm glad not everyone is like minded to him...thank you for your work and your open mind <3I have realised how much i care for people after been revived by emt in my home in the u.k, if my partner was not giving md oxegyn for 36 minuites i would be toastIt’s professionals like you that can change peoples minds about the stigma of drug addiction, and how showing compassion is way more effective than the failed war on drugs attitude. Thank you for everything you do and have done.Nice Job! Be careful so u dont burn out with that much work tho.. I work nurse/construction (male), and ruined my health thru getting in dept and then heavily over-working.. cant really function much without opiates now cuz of health issues...Thank you, but not all firefighter/emts think like you..the real heroesYou guys are the best, thank you.Oding in front of my local emt has ruined my life is so many ways. I wish I didn't have to look like such a piece of trash while they were saving my life. Everyone I know locally has heard of my overdose and now everyone I call for law enforcement nobody takes me seriously. I've posted about getting my ass kicked by a black � and and wondered why the cops didn't help me. I I asked my older brother about it he's 35 I'm late twentys and he says that society feels like people who are constantly using drugs will OD eventually so these peramedics are sort of jaded because if they save you this time chances are they will eventually be too late one-day and find your lifeless body out there. Why would they invest their feelings In a person who obviously doesn't care about themselves. Ah long rant I'm sorry having to deal with cops again God I hate working down south. Murfreesboro rdThank youThank you, for every day you have the fortitude and love that u share, that u choose to give back.Police officers can be so aggressive with that shit. Like the dude just died, give him a break.I know it's My fault. They saved my life so I can't talk shit about them... They are why I had to spend a hundred on the fire departments donation day "feed the boot" But God damn the attitude the cops give me when the emt tells the cop they have been to my place before.... � � Yeah but both treat me like the trash that I am. I don't really know how I feel about it. They are upstanding citizens and I'm trash according to the copsThis was a beautiful message and you're a great human being. Were you saying at the end there that if we feel we're about to relapse we could call an ambulance to stop us?? Though that would be wonderful if that was the case, I feel as if the paramedics like yourself who would be happy to attend an addict about to make a terrible decision to try and help would be massively outnumbered by those who would see it as a waste of their time. Considering many paramedics already resent having to go out to narcan addicts when that's literally bringing them back from the brink of death, I'd imagine that a much larger amount wouldn't be happy if they find out they've been called just because a junkie is sick or about to relapse. However, the fact that there are people like you out there is enough to reassure me personally that not everyone sees us as scum. Usually we have to look to other addicts to get any kind of compassion or sympathy, so to receive it from someone who only sees us at our very worst and who hasn't experienced it themselves is uplifting, so thanks a lot for that. We need people like you if we're going to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic that's writing off huge swathes of the population, and I just hope that more people realize that your approach of kindness & empathy is far more effective in the long run than callous apathy, stricter punishments or "tough love". 

One little nitpick:

>Everyone deserves a shot

I can almost guarantee that when most people on this subreddit read this sentence, your intended meaning isn't the first one that jumps to mind! hahaYou’re pure class.Bless youThank you for your words, your empathy, and your service. Thank you.Thank you for what you do, OP. I had a similar experience happen. April 28, 2018 I overdosed at my moms house. She found me dead, lips purple face blue. She gave me CPR the entire time until EMT's / police arrived. My twin brother went through my pockets as soon as my mom found me, took the fentanyl and left the house. I'm so fucking lucky to be here, I was dead. My older brother is a firefighter/EMT 8 hours south of where my mom and I live. I'm so fucking proud to say I have been 100% clean since August 6, 2019. Life is getting better, and I've been going to substance abuse therapy classes 4 days a week (Intensive Out Patient, or IOP).

Again, thank you so much for what you do. You and all of your brothers and sisters are heros. For real.

Keep saving ppl man, I know it takes its toll on yall, so dont hesitate to get therapy if dark thoughts start creeping in. I survived a 12 year heroin/fentanyl addiction, and I've lost more friends that I can count on both hands.

Keep being a hero, OP. We're rooting for you. And please be careful, I know how easy it is to lose your life to a house fire collapsing/being burned alive. Please be careful OP ❤Thanks for helping out and caring. I have over dosed many times when I was using heroin heavily and it was happening so much that the emt’s were just sick of it and I don’t blame them. It sucks because the problem is not going to be corrected with this epidemic and “war on drugs” until some drastic Changes are implemented like decriminalize opiates in a setting kind of like a methadone clinic, and I just feel like it will never happen. Thanks again for saving life’s it’s awesome to know that there are people who care. Peace and love - ATLienIt's all good till you get the bill.“Everyone deserves a shot”. Anybody else immediately imagine shooting up?That sucks. Paramedics got a hard job. Obviously you mean well and most on here appreciate it. Personally whole "you're not alone/you can beat this/theres a light at the end of this dark road" sentiment doesn't do anything for me though. Kind of annoyed by it at this point actually only cause you see it everywhere from people who are part of this expectation by society as a whole that you should seek treatment if you are a active user. Its also a big reddit karma magnet... Not trying to be a dick but if that's how i come off i can live with the downvotes. 

You've got a good heart. thanks for being willing to put up with such a difficult job.I know first hand that what you say is true. EMTs saved my life on more than one occasion. I felt very guilty for troubling them. Thank you a million times over.This is so true, it’s heart breaking when I see the low self worth opioids seem to produce in people.   It’s all part of the mind tricks these drugs play on people to just make them come up with yet another excuse to destroy their lives with opioids. 

Most the folks here have many people in their lives who love them, care about them and worry about them. You are not a dirty junky in their eyes, you are their child, parent, lover, etc. in their minds. 

I’ve dealt with many people who have lost their children, siblings or significant others to overdoses. It is absolutely devastating and leaves a permanent hole in their lives. In many ways they are the true victims of the epidemic. 

Please just think of those people in your lives. If you hate yourself too much to care about your own wellbeing then think about theirs. Chances are there are people who will be devastated if something ever happens to you.you da real MVP. thank you for your kind words and all the work you provide ❤️2 cousins are Paramedics and ambulance drivers. They are the toughest two girls i know and mad as brushes. Their brother is a despatch operator due to having to get off the roads due to health,hypertension, no wonder.,he lasted nearly 20 years .I would like to say something to you. First and foremost, THANK YOU from the bottom of my HEART! I am 37 years old, and at 28 I was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer that causes Deep Bone Pain from my blood scarring my own bone marrow. I was a star athlete in soccer and baseball growing up, and also did boxing for several years. I had NEVER tried opiates until a DOCTOR PRESCRIBED them to me. I was on opiates for 7 years ,and asked my Doctors on numerous occasions, "WHAT'S PLAN B?" When I was put on these meds I whole heartedly trusted the Doctors and what they were doing. I was naive to think I could just stop something after so long, and wake up the next day and be fine. I quickly found out the Mental/Physical ANGUISH of Withdrawals. It is like NOTHING I have ever experienced in my Life. In saying that, when I approached my medical professional's (so I thought) they really didn't make the exit plan of getting of these pills a BIG DEAL. I was told it would be about 3 days of some
 "Discomfort" and that's it. BULLSHIT!!!! On Day 3 I was within seconds of blowing my Brains out, and I had never been there mentally in my LIFE. So back on the pills I went. Months later I was furious with the (HEALTHCARE) System we AMERICANS have in place. They get Rich off of turning naive normal people into pill junkies, but don't want to help when you decide your done taking them. The reason I'm writing this to you is because on numerous occassions my Wife had to call out the Fire Department in my Area (Phoenix Fire Dept.) ,and I was treated like a PIECE OF SHIT for trying to COLD TURKEY what a Doctor prescribed. An then some of the Fire guys just stare at you like, well you got yourself in this mess,so you gotta get yourself out of it. Again, I had ZERO understanding of what I was taking at first because this was before the big Opiate Epidemic Bullshit when I started them for pain from Cancer. Now that I've been through it, I really have LOST a lot of hope with anyone that takes care of people medically. EMTS, FIRE GUYS/WOMEN, NURSES, DOCTORS,ETC. THEY HAVE ALL FORGOT WHY THEY GOT INTO THE FIELD TO BEGIN WITH. EMPATHY IS LACKING SO MUCH, and most of them in a hospital setting have terrible bedside manner....but You are a breath of fresh air my friend. So, for that I THANK YOU more than you will ever imagine. ��Thank you for this. I'm a recovering opioid addict, but I'm friends with a lot of people in active addiction. When I was shooting up, I felt like my life didn't matter. I felt like if I were to OD I didn't deserve to come back, and in sure a lot of my friends feel that way, too."Everyone deserves a shot "

heh, kind of ironic to say in this sub given the topic.

&#x200B;

HOwever, thank you so much for the work that you do for your community. know that i and the other people on this sub appreciate your work. what you do for others on the daily is probably more than i have done for others my whole life. thank youThank you for existing, mate!This just brought happy tears to my eyes. Thank you, you’re beautiful ♥️Waking up from an OD surrounded by cops and emts was one of the scariest and most shameful moments of my life, and I absolutely could not have gotten through it if it wasn't for the genuine complete kindness I received from the emt who narcaned me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your attitude and what you do.I wish there was more people like you out there my friend. Thank you so much for your compassion and sympathy to addicts. It is not an easy life and is tough for both parties involved in an overdose. 

Please never change my friend.

God speed.The world needs you, thank you.Big Pharma got my Mom and Aunt hooked on prescription Oxy years ago. Neither of them actually needed it, but the rest is history and the law suits are finally happening. Unfortunately my Aunt switched to heroine and eventually did not make it. Took my Mom about 10 years to get off the Oxy but she’s now been off it for 10 years. When I was 13 we were grocery shopping and she overdosed in the middle of the grocery store. The EMT came and did what you guys do best. I’m very thankful for people like you. My Mom has made a full recovery since all of that, is re-married, owns a house, and got promoted to Operations Manager of a manufacturing plant. As much as I hope they bring down Big Pharma with these law suits, unfortunately it can never bring back those lost like my Aunt.Can’t begin to thank you for this post. I work as a mental health counselor and see so many people struggling with addiction who have lost people they love to drugs, primarily due to not wanting to face police and doctors who are judgmental and unkind. Your post was so empathic and kind. Thank you for everything that you do!This is the best reddit post I’ve ever come across!I'm too broke to give you gold that you deserve but this is better than nothing... ���Firefighters and EMTs are the real heroes. Cops can go fuck themselves.

Do you realize that 2/3 of unintentional overdoses would go away immediately if we ended Drug Prohibition? This is all due to not having a regulated legal market.

Addiction is a problem but Drug Prohibition causes 100x as much danger and 1000x as much violence. Addicts could work 9-5s and get high 3 times a day until they're ready to get clean. And meanwhile not fucking die off of a strong or tainted batch. You'd actually know what you're putting into your body.

This bullshit won't end until Drug Prohibition does.Funny how when they bring someone back with a defibrillator that is obese and eats them selves to death there is no guilt.  Same issue.  Addiction.  Just different substances.  Only issue is one is illegal so we morally condemn those that use heroin. Sad state of affairs for our country.  Thank you for your service and seeing the good in ALL people. Not just those that society deems worthyIt's all good till you get the bill.What I don't understand is the people who overdose multiple times and are known to first responders.  I think most of those people are likely suicidal and would likely kill themselves another way if there were no opiates. 
 I suppose they could be very wreckless and stupid never taking testers on a new bag.   The problem of fentanyl hotspots can be solved by volumetric dosing something that is a lot simpler than having the police come and narcan you.  I would imagine it sucks pretty bad to get narcan'd and a person would take measures avoid it.   I'm incredibly lucky that I have never had to be hit with it in 20 years of use.>*Everyone deserves a* ***shot***

Lol.Thank you, emt’s and an incredibly kind Good Samaritan saved my life two years ago in a dollar general parking lot, hit with narcan countless times and resuscitated, wish I knew who saved my life that night so I could thank them. I’m clean and able to help other addicts these days.KThanks dogg, your work and this type of  encouragement keeps people alive.  It’s a shame that the cops want to tag along and threaten people at one of the lowest moments of their lives but, the fact that another addict survived is the important thing.  Thanks and keep it up.In my home town, it seems like the majority of police officers and EMT have little man syndrome. I woke up w 5 EMT standing above me w an ekg machine on me. The one fuck purposely poked me 5 times for an IV line and said I should be used to it.I really do appreciate you saying that. I wish we could all be a little more open and care a little more about eachother.Good to see you doing well bro.He could be a dirty shitbagNo joke PTSD and alcoholism are both very prevelant in EMT’s enough that they warn you about how to handle rough memories while in trainingDefinitely not for the money, i work 2 Fire depts and a warehouse 90-100hrs a week to make ends meet. It’ll all be okay in the end, if its not okay then it is not the end. If you need to blow off steam or need someone feel free to pm me or comment right here and i will do my best to get to you in a timely manner. Lotta people in this world need help, you cant help anyone if you cant help yourself and youre no good to anyone dead. Chin up man.Yup. A fucking cop comes to me while I'm out of it in the hospital, just getting Narcaned for the umpteenth time, and his only concern was where I got it. I told.him I was sorry but I couldn't help him. I was very polite and respectful!
So the fucker gives me a paraphernalia charge. Like, I'm almost dead you fucking asshole.Or just don’t overdose fucking idiotsExactly. Police and drug laws are the exact opposite of the solution to drugs.

Drug Prohibition is like seeing one of your tires is low on air so you shoot out the other three tires to even it out. It causes 1000x the pain and death that the drugs themselves do.Glad to know you are still with us all, go drop some cookies off at your Fire dept! Theyll love ya for it!I’ll do my best man, hopefully you can bounce back okayNo they dont. We’re people too so theres going to be different opinions on it. However the fact is every single one of us took an oath to treat the patient without judgement to the best of our ability. Which means whether they feel the same as i do or not you will be treated the same. The mentality is changing.There are a lot of salty medics, the fact is whether or not they care they took an oath to help you stay alive. A lot of the guys I work with myself included have had days where it is tiring pulling the same people away from death over and over because of these drugs. Myself and a good amount of my coworkers do genuinely care but yes it takes a toll. You just have to remember why you got into the field and that is to help people. My Chief said to us that once you stop caring, death no longer phases you, or you hear the words structure fire possible occupants and it doesnt get your heart pounding its time to find another job. Im sorry youve had bad experiences with first responders. We are not all the same, we are individuals clocking into our jobs. I hope you are clean and if not i hope you do have the strength to get clean. Once you are stop by the fire dept. thank them for helping you, a lot of what we do goes without gratitude and if you show it there is a good chance you will change their perspective at least for a little while.Fucking cops man. I mean, they have to see that they're doing literally 0 good in the Drug War, right? They can't actually believe busting 1 of the 62 dealers in the city is going to actually accomplish anything, can they?

Honestly I dunno how someone could live life with that much cognitive dissonance. Shit makes my brain hurt to even consider.Depends on the cop. The one today lost his cool for a bit but ive had other runs where theyll sit down with the patient and talk it out, see how theyre doing before going into questioning. As for other people commenting how i should have told the cop not to be a dick, i cant. We are seperate departments seperate bosses seperate jobs. When you are on scene everything has to look as perfect as possible in public eye, if theres an issue you talk about it in private one on one. Never in front of the public. Keep in mind they are  just people going to work. If some random jackwad on the street youd never met before thought you were trash would you care? Id hope not. They dont know you man. I dont know you.I just know that a lot of the guys i work with understand its a real issue and we do need to be there for these patients because it is a life and death struggle. It aint some stubbed toe bs.I have been on one call where the gentleman was having severe withdrawl and said he knew the symptoms would go away if he used. He asked us to not put an IV in and to take him to the hospital so he couldnt get high. He was trying to quit. The fact is we respected the hell out of him for it. And we gladly will help someone like that. Honestly we would prefer going to that than going to revive you or explain to your family that you are not going to wake up. If you dont want to burden emergency services just drive yourself to the hospital and explain to them the situation.A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/opiates) if you have any questions or concerns.*Thanks fam. Hope all is well with u tooWhat the fuck? He sounds like a sweet guy, sounds like you’re a shitbag.I can’t even imagine. I know I wouldn’t be able to handle it.Lucky he didn't plant stuff on youGo play Fortnite and suck on your Juul.  Addiction to tobacco is no different, it just kills you a lot slower.  Hypocritical asshat.CuntnuggetAmen brother.  You'd think we could learn a lesson after what happened with alcohol prohibition.  Spoiler alert; it created poisonous booze, helped the mob thrive etc.  Prohibition will never work!that's a fantastic idea!!I posted about a week ago where two people kicked my ass in a very public place and the cops did nothing about it... I just realized why they didn't help me. I could get them fired from what I have been told by their supervisor but fuck I might as well let that go. Next time people with guns are messing with me they won't have an excuse to let me get shot �I was **in** the hospital bed. He came to me while I was delirious. Then throws the papers on my bed.How the fuck is it no different? I’m not shoving needles into my arm and can actually quit if I want to which I diddropped off a gift card to a coffee shop they frequent! talked for a little bit! he was really appreciative of it!! thanks!What a piece of shitWell first of all, not all of us use needles dude.  Both are addictions, and both can kill you.  Also, opiate addicts can and do also quit all the time.  Lots of recovering addicts.  Wonder how many people die from tobacco a year.  Well I looked it up:  "According to the Centers for Disease Control, 443,000 people die from diseases related to smoking each year. Smoking deaths are one of the most preventable causes of premature death."  That's a lot more than opiates kill.  Also, medical professionals are treating these people.  One could easily argue tobacco users, whether its vaping or whatever, are a much bigger drain on our society.  Just because sticking a needle in your arm is nasty doesn't make you any better.  Telling addicts to just not overdose just shows how much you don't care about people going through addiction problems.  You're not any better and you should maybe think about not judging and realize you've done an addictive substance that is far more deadly.  It's just not as taboo.  Have a good one dude.Also, how did you end up on the heroin and opiate subreddits?!  Hmmm  are you just here to bash people or what the fuck?  LolLol I looked and you just quit a month ago.  You commented 17 days ayo about it.  You don't seem to be insensitive to tobacco addicts though.  It's just not cool man.  They're human beings tooCant read your other comment except on your profile.  Maybe got shadowbanned.  This is r/opiates btw not r/heroin dude.  I'm a pain patient because I have a horrible congenital defect in my spine. You may not have done horrible shit.  That's not the point I made.  My point is they're both extremely destructive.  They're both extremely addictive.  They just kill you in different ways.  Tobacco is an even bigger strain than our health care system than any opiate.  They're completely the same in all those aspects and worse in some.  Overall tobacco is more harmful to society in terms of deaths and strain on our healthcare system.  That's just the facts.  I'm glad you don't steal and shit.  But you have consumed and been addicted to a substance that does more damage than opiates.  My norco prescription is why I'm on here.  I'm not a heroin addict. 

Your lack of compassion for people that are addicted to opiates is very offensive to me.  This sub is a huge harm reduction sub.  You think it's glorifying opiates and some people do.  This sub isn't the defining factor in people who use opioids like me.  I dont glorify it.  I'm not here for negative reasons.  I have compassion for addicts.  I don't think they're any less human, and definitely don't think they deserve to overdose like you do.  Your ignorance and insensitivity are truly appalling.  I'd never wish ill on you or anyone because I hate what drug addicts do.  I'm not justifying stealing or glorifying opiates.  I've seen many posts and comments of people warning other users they're on a slippery slope and they need to seek recovery.  If this sub helps save a few lives in any way it's a great thing.  If you want to think otherwise that's your choice.  I'm just hoping you get where I'm coming from.  I wish you a happy life, take care man.Doesn’t seem like anyone on here cares either. I’m pissed cuz people are on here glorifying, romanticizing and posting pics of their stash. It’s so different, I didn’t ruin my life and steal and cheat after ripping my juul. I didn’t hunch over in the middle of the road and walk around like a zombie after ripping my juul. Nah fuck that you can’t compare the two at allThe people who get clean and talk about how all addicts should just overdose are the worst type of people.    It seems like whenever these types relapse they usually OD.   Probably because they often have the "go big or go home"  mentality.I’m sorry to hear that and I think that is a complete different story than other people that just choose to escalate their drug choices where it gets to the point of opiates. And no I saw a picture of some dude flaunting like 5 grams of fentanylHahaha bro you’re a retard. You should do us all a favour and overdose yourself.

Fuck off this sub and never come back, wanker.Fuck you, you stupid cuntYou're right the two aren't comparable.   You can walk into the store and purchase nicotine in a multitude of delivery mechanisms,  the quality and strength are consistent with each product. 

Opiates are less physically damaging than nicotine as long as ROA is safe.  Psychologically the difference could vary. 

So what criteria was used to make certain psychoactives legal? 

There are lot of people who use that hold down full time jobs.  A lot more than you probably think.   Thinking that every opiate user is a walking zombie and immediately visable really really contributes to making it difficult to seek help.  When people say absurd things which are often taken as truth in pop culture it really is a testament to their ignorance.Nope, they just recently banned dope porn pictures.>romanticizing

i think if any sub romanticizes an addiction, it'd probably be the vaping/smoking communities on here. saying that as someone who used to smoke and still vapes. this community is riddled with horror stories of death and addiction. nobody really thinks addiction or death is cool, even the people here. besides, stash pics are banned here.Why are you actively commenting in an opiates subreddit then? Get the fuck out normieI appreciate the kind words.  Yeah, I don't think that shits cool at all.  Fentanyl is a fucking plague.  It's killing so many people and making my life harder.  The opioid epidemic has made legitimate pain patients like myself feel like criminals.  A lot of people have a hard time finding doctors that will prescribe pain meds.  Doctors are under a ton of pressure and it's making my life and lots of others way more difficult than it used to be.  I have to get my meds 1 month at a time now, refills at 30 days and take a drug test every month.  That's $200 since I dont have insurance.  It's a pain in the ass and I got enough pain already!  But I'm not the only one out there.  Some people start like me and end up on heroin.  I'll never touch the stuff, never have never will.  But I do understand frustration with some addicts.  It affects me directly.  Just please know there's guys like me (I'm only 30 too) who are on opiates.  And some even buy what they think are legit pain pills off the street, but they're pressed with fentanyl.  Then they overdose.  I'm lucky enough to have a great doctor and an otherwise healthy body besides my spine.  But some people overdose because they buy off the street, not being able to find a pain doc.  It happens.  Take care and have a good rest of the weekendI don’t take any truth from “pop culture” I drive down the road and see a zombie on every corner. I live by a road called the methadone mile so idk wtf you’re talking aboutI'm sorry to hear that.   Its bullshit that they took lifesaving pain medication away because of this whole paradigm shift in the opiate market. 

At this point I don't know why the US is engaged is drug warfare.   After all drug prohibition introduced fentanyl into the diamorphine black market and displaced the golden opiate with synthetics.   The supply chain was already in place and the amount of money that is going who knows where because of fentanyl is amazing. 

So let just stop this and let me go to the safety of a shop to buy any chemical I desire.  It won't be long before molecular printing or some type of implant or visual interface that is able to duplicate the effects of drugs. 

Every law based on morals has been overturned.   Why are we grasping so strongly to drug prohibition which absolutely is unconstitutional.   Cui bono?What are you doing here if you hate addicts? Like, what do you gain from this? Just the snide satisfaction of "sticking it to junkies"?

I'm going to explain something to you. Opiate addiction rates are through the roof right now. I read one estimate that said "there's an average of 1 addict per household", that seems a bit high but you get the point.

The junkies you see on the street robbing each other for morsels are just the tip of the iceberg. ***A lot*** of people are on opiods for one reason or another, it's just that the only people you know are on drugs are the ones that are mentally ill too.

Most are functioning addicts, you'll find a fair few here with jobs, families, ect. 

I'm not saying any of this makes it right, or wrong really. I'm just saying, maybe don't come in here with some caricature of what you think an addict is, with no personal experience, and hold that against random people online. That's more your problem than any of ours. 

You have no idea what you are talking about.I completely agree.  People will always experiment with drugs.  Prohibition only creates a black market and empowers criminals.  It does nothing to curb people's drug use.  Drug companies oversaturated the market with oxycontin and people finally woke up and realized what was happening and we had this huge backlash.  Things should just have gone to how they were before.  They shouldn't have created new restrictions that harm people.  The damage was done.  They created a sink hole of addicts that turned to illicit drugs like heroin.  If people could just go and get their desired substance from a regulated marketplace everything would be fine.  We do it with things like methadone so I dont see what people think is going to happen.  Everyone isn't all of a sudden going to be come drug addicted zombies.  It will have a positive effect.  It will take the money out of the hands of cartels.  Legalization of marijuana has more than shown what kind of amazingly positive impacts will come about.  Like you pointed out, they've created a fentanyl epidemic that us making, what I consider murderers, millions if not billions of dollars.  I feel like a criminal every mo th when I pick up my norco prescription for my legitimate pain.  And I'm a lucky one that has a good doctor who isn't scared as well as a good pharmacy who knows me well.  They are a smaller pharmacy though because I hear horror stories of places like walgreens and CVS that refuse to fill doctors scripts.  I'm glad people like you can see the future and understand the present on these drug issues.  Drug prohibition will never and has never worked.  We actually did treat drug addicts as a health problem before a lot of these drug laws.  Just legalize everything and regulate it so we can all be safe.  We have no problem letting people kill themselves with alcohol and tobacco.  If people want to do that, that's their choice.  It's no one else's business what I put into my body in the privacy of my home.  Take care friendRead my past comments. Half of my family are addicts of some kind @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Lmao, Content: , ups: 566, downs: 0"You don't want to smoke crack on adderall"

Nah, i'm good!

A short time later...... "OH FUCK I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK" don't mix your uppers and uppers girls and boys!This is literally me all the time. �Me: “If you take those bars, do NOT drink alcohol”

Friend: “bullshit what do you think you know everything? I got this!”

2 hours later passes out completely and starts to vomit uncontrollably.

Man I hate being the one of my friends that knows a lot about drugs. No one listens to you until they learn the hard way lmao
This is me. I've ALWAYS told my friends the more you know about drugs and how to do them safely, the longer you'll stay alive. �Straight scholar Literally me explaining half-lives. It's always the person on opiates who knows their shit.I always know what not to mix but mix anyway but I fucked up my tolerance to every class of drugs so it takes a lot of everything to fuck me up. Hopefully I jinxed myself and I'll run outta luck, I hate my life Hzhahaha omfg Its opioid! Not opiate! Fucking idiot! Jk. But fr people get like this alot. Ah the saddest thing is wasted talent. 
Aka me and everyone who upvoted this lol. 

I can probably explain the neurochemical reaction to most rec and psyc drugs, why/how they may damage the brain, long/short time side effects, half lives, addiction potential, what receptor subtypes they work on and by how much if they work on multiple ones. Alongside if they're agonists, antagonists, reuptake inhibitors etc. Best route of administration (bioavailability), effects on other parts of the body & so much more. 

Fuck - That's not talent I'm coming to realize as I approach my mid 20s lol ��. 
The amount of upvotes on this post now just confirmed that for me even moreso hah. �‍♂️ �

My parents way of keeping some hope in me for themselves & way of (trying to) instilling what little confidence I have left often say "oh you're very clever you know that? How you know about pharmaceuticals, drugs and the brain. You should become a dr. So much wasted talent" . This is coming from the parent who's a pharmacist. I'd often know more about drugs than her or other drs or pharmacists in my family at gatherings. I think that's just in regards to psychatric medication though. 
Speak about anything else or any other medication or human biological function and I'll be put into my place as the peasant I am. Lol.

At one point I was feeling high (in both ways hehe) & mighty with my parents bullshit comments about my so called intelligence not helping either like "ah you know what? I do have potential still/don't give up on yourself yet as you're "average" person at school doesn't know this sort of stuff. When you do! You're not dumb."

However as time passed, I slowly got older, watching my friends get  good jobs, married, travel, soon have kids & most importantly develop actual skills lol ... I'm  still here obsessed/addicted to certain drugs while at the same time trying to to get this monkey off my back (kicked opiates after a 2 year daily iv habit. 
Tbh though still use once every couple months or so. 
But compared to what I'm dependent on now aka benzos I wish I could have my opiate addiction back and never started benzos as a socially acceptable replacement to iv opiates as I feel they've taken a part of me from me.

Not that opiates didn't do that but at least with them you'd  be back to your normal self, or for the  most part in about 10 days.
Where with benzo dependency it can take months. So I'm told. I'm a few weeks in to the almost last of my benzo taper & it's bloody hard along with scary what damage they've done to my brain/cognitive skills, social skills & personality.  

Ah clearly I wasn't Mr know it all about drugs.
If I was, I would have stuck to what I'd preach to myself in my mind and others who'd ask me about drugs aka "oh just stick to weed & you'll be fine.". 
That or at least stuck to opiates and just quit those instead of using benzos as a socially acceptable & quick/cheap/practical way to deal with my anxiety or cravings.
So truI literally went to college to be that guy. I am that guy, and people know it. When I let my friends watch me do a CWE on some hydros one time they were deadass like kids watching a chemistry demonstration in school.I knew all the rules and what shouldn’t be mixed yet I’d shoot fent dope and eat 6-12mg of Xanax daily. Knowledge does not equal recovery or being safe yourself. Lol  Coke & boomers, bad mix....Lololol [deleted]That’s how I feel just telling them what pills they can and can’t snort lololDont get it[deleted]I've mixed uppers so much. Speedballs were also my thing, have yet to see a cardiologist and my heart pain is so bad ): I go to the ER and they always tells me nothing wrong. So I guess it's normal to get 10/10 heart pains so bad that you literally have to call an ambulance. My hearts fucked and it's from triple cs, uppers, and mixing Hell, even when they do learn the hard way and still don't listen, sometimes i just wonder how some people can still be alive. I feel obligated to say "username checks out" :)I swear this is true for some reason. I will never understand it, but it’s hella true.Probably because they are the most-fucked and understand why lmaoCWE? Only if you change your username to CaptainWeOD are you asking seriously orHe’s saying he feels smart explaining drugs and their effects to his friends Yeah it's only killed a bunch of people - no biggie.okay retard lmaoThis nigga gon die ☠get to that cardiologist asap, holy smokesdamn dawg. can I ask why you took triple c's instead of something with just dxm?No kidding I have a friend I just gave up on when It came to being safe. I’d watch the kid almost kill himself and magically come alive so many times.   gave the kid narcan a dozen times or so.. it’s fucked. Some People don’t care about being safe lmaoA lot of times they just die. It's happened too many times in my life.My first username checks out. I dig it, man. thanks �Cold water extraction, taking all the acetaminophen out of the pills[deleted]Except in my case, I often find my friends don’t really care. I need more friends who do drugs I got that, no idea who the character is, nor how it relatesI'm only 18 if that helps, but then again I had pre existing heart conditions befkre all the drugs They are 30mg and more convenient. Some people even prefer them. I prefer a drug called Ketamine, but y’all probably think it’s not cool like DXM :(Not only do I love they're 30mg, but I love the antihistamine, it synergizes and makes for a more intense experince and it's very easy to feel like you're dying on them which is my favorite feeling. I love them but I can't do them any more due to health problems. I always say that tho and get yo binging again but I'm few weeks clean today. Pushing for that month at a very small dose, yes. others may tell you otherwise out of fear, but I work in anesthesiology. doctors prescribe benzos and opioids regularly. do NOT overdo it. I mean generally I’ll only give out this info if it’s relevant. So if a buddy tells me he’s going to do acid this weekend and wants some tips, I’ll happily share some, but I won’t just start talking about safe consumption of LSD out of the blue lolThat’s from an episode of spongebob where he enters everybody’s dreams. That’s his pet snail Gary’s dream. He dreams about reading in a library pre existing heart condition and a speedball killed my boyfriend.  please please be safebe careful man, definitely get that checked out. And stop those combos. Had a friend who had to have heart surgery bc of stuff like this.

It would fuck them up for life think about it.It's a struggle sorry to hear, are you sober now? have you seen a cardiologist?  no need to answer if too personal of course �early 20sah I see ha I already feel fucked up for life and it's very obvious the damage I've done. Everytime I dose now I just kinda hope it kills me. I'm tappin out man, this life shit ain't for me Well have only been sober for 1 day now, but told my dealer to cut me off so I should be ok.

Lol) say the city??I mean, it says the city name in the image.  This rule is seemingly unavoidable sometimes, especially if there is a company or initiative with the city name in the title, a phone number with a local area code, etc.  Is there any chance of that rule changing?From the sidebar: 

>No location-specific posts! This includes neighborhoods AND cities. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources.Hrm, I guess photo-wise, that ruling would be pretty subjective. I don't think it would really lead to sourcing though. The focus is more on comedy than using drugs in said city. However, whenever cities get mentioned in texts posts or comments, people end up going too far with it (like pming users about it). 

Personally, I really doubt there is any chance of that rule changing at all, given the current state of things on reddit and the seeming push to ban things that make reddit look bad. If you would like to make a post about it or message the mod team for a more veteran mod to give their opinion on it, feel free to!

And it takes two careless people to accidentally create one, don't forget that part!You sound sexist and like you don’t know what you’re talking about. Being an addict doesn’t automatically equal bad parent. It’s common to get knocked up in early recovery because opiates can suppress your cycle/ovulation and girls are unprepared for the return of their fertility. Regardless, there are functional addicts who are able to love and care for their children, don’t judge another unless you’ve walked in their shoes.Lol but your comment wasn't edited? God damn if that ain't true!

Fucking love a girl with a choker.Ever fought the baby itself? Lil fuckers are a lot quicker than you'd think, and don't be lulled into a false sense of security if Baby doesn't have teeth in yet. Getting a calf full of rock hard gum hurts like the dickens, even through Jncos!Not a lot of gold gifted around /r/opiates. Wonder whyDoes anyone want to buy a gold?Except you have kratom. What can I say man just speaking from the heart. True storyThe other salient point is when it comes to quitting something it's much easier if it isn't embedded in your  social life. I probably dodged a bullet there.And couldn't afford the abortion [deleted]On the right Girl, it’s fucking hot and I’m definitely a sucker for it lol. But like all things, like tattoos even, they can be trashy. "Even thru Jncos," killed me. �because were junkies and we dont have money for gold. that would be lost heroin tokens!!Scrounging around for nickels to buy a cheap pack of cigarettes.Have we dated? Haha jokesHard pressed? I personally know several! Do you have children? Are you personally familiar with how the system works? Unless you can answer yes to both those questions, I suggest you move on. (Oh and nothing I said was sexist, unlike your atrocious comment).Word. Well done tattoo? Hell yeah. 

$15 heart tattoo that looks like my dog drew it? Hard pass. That and "hurts like the dickens" this thread is absolute comedic gold for me today.How do you know if you got gold on the alien blue app? They gave two years of free gold at one point, but idk how to check it or karma or whatever. 

I hate the Reddit app, so I still use alien blue. "Cigarettes"There was a dude that lived with us (me, my older sister, brother in law and their kids) who was on pills and a super heavy drinker (this was back when I was starting down my opiate addiction, had only been addicted to them for a few years at this point) who had a tattoo gun and would do super cheap tattoos, basically only word tattoos with several different kinds of font or calligraphy or the most simple of designs that would be fairly small and incredibly not well done.  This one chick who was acquainted with my older sister and would come by fairly frequently decided to get a like heart of some sort with her husband's name in the middle.  He charged her like $40 or $50 and as one would imagine it was incredibly not nice looking.  She was furious and the next day came by looking for him and wanted it fixed. My input to her was along the lines of, "What exactly did you expect for paying an incredibly small amount from someone who isnt a professional and having it done in our bathroom."


She was not amused and had seriously told me she expected better and that was a lot of money for a tattoo.  I showed her my one tattoo I had at the time and asked her what she thought I paid for it and I forget what she guessed but she was so amazingly far off thinking it was a hell of a lot cheaper than it was (it was professionally done by a friend of mine who is a tattoo artist)  pay shitty prices get shitty work.  I don't get why so many people dont understand that.I'd take a tattoo your dog drew. He's just doing his best to be a good boyi am not really sure to be honest. i dont use that app:/I just paid 300 bucks for a tattoo, and I thought that was pretty cheap lmao. People need to do their research before they get something that lasts forever.God I remember "tattoo parties" back in the day lol. The guy in your story reminds me of the tattoo party guy from my hometown. 

I think most people don't realize how much good work costs. $6,000+ for a full horror film themed sleeve is a bargain when the work is impeccable. And at least $100 tip after every session is the norm. He's 11 and only does paw prints. He's become stubborn in his old age lol. No worriesBack in'98, I turned 18 and wanted my first tattoo. I picked a design to be inked onto the top of my foot. I went to an actual place.

Anyway, the artist began to caution me against putting a first tattoo on a painful and high friction area. We're sitting back in her workspace discussing it when the receptionist out front overhears the conversation and comes back.

So, the receptionist says, "... you know where a *CLASSY* and *unique* place is that I've seen some women put a tattoo?" , she asked?

"Where's that?" I replied...
She said, " on the small of the back,".�

I go ahead and agree. Total 90s shit, too. A flower, ladybug, some Chinese lettering bullshit. About ten years later, I'm listening to the radio, and what do ya know? They were talking about TRAMP STAMPS.

But...but...that bitch said it was classy!!��

Separate but related...
A friend of mine who I was lucky enough to be cellmates with last time I was in county had the best tattoo. A barbed wire cross tattooed on her titty.Pffft.  I probably paid 30 ramen soups in total for my tattoos.  All professionally done.Hahaa ughLmao can you imagine just having a scribble and a paw print next to it and be like (I let my friends dog do an original. T-thats the signature)I got my first (and only so far) down the side of my ribs. A fox outline with mountains and trees in it. Hurt like a bitch. I can't imagine having one on my foot though. I think the artist was right to warn you... oof.

Gotta say though, a barbed-wire titty is pretty amazing. Would totally get that if I were a woman. 

Oh, and hey, doesn't matter if it's classy as long as it looks good :DI know a chick with an assault rifle tattooed across her chest. Also has serious dreads.

This area has a bad rep. I think they had a kid in the car. 

Edit: yea they did. Someone linked the article. Shits so sad.  Always hated seeing people use around kids.  Most ashamed I’ve ever been is hanging out with these two people and the dboy’s girl while he copped for us.  They had custody of their grandchildren. The two kids were 5 and 12.  While I waited(of course it was like 3 hours) we all sat in this room(with no door knob/didn’t close, hella dirty) they were just smoking clear and black like it was no one’s business.  I said something to my plugs chick about them just using openly in front of the kids and she was just like oh it’s no big deal, they don’t know what’s going on.  I was so upset over it.  Can’t stand people straight using in front of kids.  Yet, still I stayed and waited for my b.  That’s addiction for you, finding yourself justifying things the normal you abhors.  They were some people that I wouldn’t mind getting locked up.  I will say I never went through that guy again.   


Edit:  funny meme though �Posting on an alt account. This picture reminds me of the time I basically saved this dude's life. The following story takes place over the course of roughly 15 minutes and is 100% true to the best of my memory.  He was an aquantaince. Not a super close friend, but we had been hanging out and he had gotten some street ready heroin/gunpowder/whatever y'all call it. It was not laced with fent, I know that for sure. 

We were sitting in my driveway and he was making a shot. I guess he had been getting bunk shit because this stuff knocked him on his ass. He finished his shot, and then nodded off after a few minutes. I wanted to tell him that I was gonna go inside and that I'd call him later, but he became unresponsive quickly. This was no ordinary, everyday nod... This was advance nodding. 

I tried calling his name loudly, but he didn't notice. He began to drool, and then his lips started turning a very faint shade of blue. I knew I had to act immediately. With no way to easily get him out of the driver's seat (I also had neighbors outside), I reached my leg over to the brake pedal, shifted the car into reverse, and proceeded to drive his car from the passenger seat down my block and around the corner. I quickly grabbed all his paraphernalia, spoon, rigs, and baggie and called 911.

I managed to drive the car reasonably well, but when I parked it I had hit the curb. Not hard, the tire was just pressed up against it.

 I told the EMS hotline person that I was coming home and I saw a car that looked like the driver had hit the curb. That I went to talk to the driver, but he was unresponsive, and mentioned his other symptoms. They asked me if I could wait by the car, but I told them I had already left the scene to come home and use my landline phone. But I told them exactly where the car was and what it looked like. 

About 30 seconds after hanging up I heard fire truck sirens. I ran back to my house, and I'm not quite sure why but I got in my car and left. No way I was sticking around, though I doubt it would have mattered if I just stayed inside. By the time i reached the bottom of my street to take a right, the firetruck and ambulance were already there. There might have been a police car, but I don't remember. 

I was gone for about an hour, and when I came back the car was gone. Later that day my friend called me and told me about what happened. He said that they gave him narcan, and since he had no paraphernalia whatsoever in the car, the EMS guys asked him if someone could come pick him up, and pick the car up. 

He had his sister and his cousin come. The car wasn't towed. He didn't die from his overdose, or get in any trouble with drug possession charges. His sister took him home safely along with his car, and that was it - literally nothing bad happened. I'm just glad I was there .. there's no doubt in my mind what would have happened if I didn't act fast in that moment. This is so brutal. I legit cannot decide how to feel about it haha. Well done. ���best one Now that's what I call happy nodsGod damn[deleted]Did they die ?The grand ma and great uncle ?

Husband looks like he was tired from a long day and took a nap and i would have not been suspicious if i walked by and he was the only one.This picture is kinda disturbing. At first I thought they were mannequins, like if you've ever heard of someone putting a mannequin in their passenger seat to drive in the H.O.V. or carpool lane.. their skin looks so clammy, pallid and pale. man, they are complete scum. think about your fucking child. could you even imagine what it would be like to watch both of your parents o.d. in front of you. at that kids age that will do some pretty good damage probably.holy christhard nodsLol reminds me of someone's Twitter handle: donotnarcanAt least he had his seat belt on...safety first obviously..except they forgot the one person do a shot at a time so one can narcan the other...rip the parents and the childs mental health(will probably be an addict as well sadly)Was there a child in the car?OOFYeah let's poke fun at bullshit junkies do to their kids. Well done Fell sorry for the kidYeah this was on the news there was a child in the backseat in a car seat I will post the link once I find ithttps://heavy.com/news/2016/09/parents-overdose-heroin-in-car-with-son-ohio-graphic-photos-rhonda-pasek-james-lee-acord-child-engangerment/

Just googled parents overdosed with baby in car,  it’s pretty sad tbh 

Photoshop game is on point in OP though Fent?The whole god damn river valley is fucked sadly. It's been years now but I used to go to Stubenville to cop. I am 2 years sober at the moment but shit man, the peoples I knew out there are not as lucky as I am and are no longer with us. RIP.

&#x200B;You from the Yo?Do you not have a Good Samaritan law where you are?  In Canada and many states you cannot be charged with possession, etc. & nor can anyone else involved (in this case your friend) if you’re reporting an overdose.  In Canada this drastically changed things and we no longer need to drag a friend to the corner to get help and then call 911 and run away.  Instead you can start performing CPR or administer narcan while you wait for first responders.  I once even had the paramedics give me time to hide (larger than possession amount) drugs before they let the cops onto the scene.  

Also, if they don’t have a Good Samaritan law, do you have access to narcan?

Edit: now that I think about it, the car definitely changes things.  I’m not sure to what degree though.As of right now, at least 9 people have upvoted this comment. That makes me think 9 people are depressed and wanna die. I always ‘joke’ about how this is how I want to die. Happy nodding out. Maybe it’s just me. 

Ps. I’m not really suicidal. Life just really sucks at the moment and suicidal ideation is a real thing. 

Edit: a letter & dude, bot bro, I’m good. :)In the original meme, there’s a dog in a car instead of two people nodded offWhy the downvotes? Seems like he just didn’t understand the joke.No, they were narcanned and spent some time incarcerated.  They might still be there, not sure.Throw me an upvote now that you know it was their grandchild.Yeah that whole thing must have been traumatizing for the kid. Couldn't imagine >I felt out sorry for the kid.

 FTFY"The poison known as heroin..." I'm sure the writer meant shitty dealers that cut their H heavy with cheap fent and don't tell their customers what they're really getting.Prolly fentBingoHoly typos in that articleThis is so incredibly sad..FUCK. Now I can't even joy this at all.  But thanks for the real life check.Yep.  Google "East Liverpool" "heroin" and you'll see how bad it is there.  Sad shit, man.  If I remember correctly, the adults were actually the kiddo's grandparents.  Which makes me wonder where the parent(s) were... That poor kid.Congrats on your sobriety I have two years also.  I’m proud of you, I know it isn’t an easy road.  Keep fighting the good fight No but close by. Im in the yo on a daily basis though. Happy nods doesn’t sound very suicidal to me sounds more like a good time lolHelperdroid and its creator love you, here's some people that can help:

 [source](https://gitlab.com/0xnaka/thehelperdroid/) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=cancerous_176)They ain't noddin, they ded �This can be used on alot of reddit posts. Oh and by the way Username checks out , good job snagging that one lol . That’s a score ��Article says that it was the boys grandmother and great uncle. Great uncle did just under a year and the grandma did 180 days. The grandma had just won custody of the child 4 weeks prior. The mother of the child lost custody 4 months before giving birth due to drugs but not heroin and is now a stripper in northern Ohio. 

I think it’s incredibly stupid how the cops just plastered all their faces all over. The same message would’ve been loud and clear with blurred faces. Also, incarceration isn’t going to fix addictions you fucking slow pigs. 

Edit: this happened in 2016 so, yes, they are out now. At least for those charges. Not sure about probation or anything along those lines. I guess at least he was young young and probably thought mum and sad where sleeping... what’s the chance kid will go down same path ?I’d go as far to say that heroin had a stigma before it was even cut with fent heavily, and for good reason lolGod why can't people wait til they get home. Esp with a kid in the car. The same exact thing happened to someone I know and both parents are now in jail. Hopefully their daughter doesn't end up remembering this because when the police showed up she had opened the door and was screaming at her mother who is very fortunate to even be alive. Granted if they were home alone they might not have ever been found but still that poor little girl watched her mother die. Where's that fucking paperclip when you need him?I kinda feel like they should blanked faces ? I mean they could of easily been placed on opiates painkillers then progressed on to h ?

 This attaches a stigma to all substance abusers , I guess it’s coz kid was in car ?
 But you can imagine the uproar non drug user from middle class felt ... behind every addiction there’s a story and a lost soul ..IDK what the yo is, but +1 for username. I used to spend a lot of days there too.  Happy nods isn’t the part that makes it suicidal. Saying happy nods to a picture of two people that look like they may have overdosed is more what I was referring to. Why would the great uncle, who I’m guessing was not the guardian of the kids, do more time than the grandmother who likely had custody? I’m probably missing something?Yes, and there was a brief discussion on the national stage about that very issue when that picture went viral.  The PD stood their ground and doubled down on their stupid, if I recall correctly, and said it was necessary to show the faces because awareness.  What a crock of shit.Now that he has to grow up with out parents probably a pretty high chance. I mean best case scenario he had someone in his family adopt him and maybe that helps in the long run, but worst case is he's thrown into the foster system. Most of those kids don't have a chance, although some do Even if the daughter doesn't remember visually what happened, it is definitely ingrained in her memory now. You don't ever forget or lose that level of fear and panic and as you get older those feelings turn into anger and abandonment issues :/ kids are literally like sponges. I hope that little girl that you know turns out alright. Lol mr clippy where are you That's the podunk East Liverpool Police Department for you.  Same PD that contacted the media to sensationalize a traffic stop where the officer got a little bit of fent under his glove and claimed overdose.  Education and law enforcement seldom go hand-in-hand when there's an agenda, sadly.  Dont do it, dont do it, dont do ist... ;)Ahh you are right haha I’m not really sure. He was charged with child endangerment and whatever they call a DUI. He had 2 prior DUIs though from what I can tell, 1 for sure. 

She had 3 charges... child endangerment, public intoxication, and I can’t remember the third. She had 1 prior of possession. 

Edit: I’m guessing because of the priors.The time was undoubtedly for the DUI. That's the one crime they can basically do whatever they want with. They have a huge window of penalities and the judge can basically do whatever the fuck he wants.

I doubt the child-related charges were even significant, though obviously the judge used it as criteria to lengthen other sentences for the additional crimes.Well, I'm just guessing but sometimes men seem to get longer sentences then women. It's also possible that since the uncle was in the driver's seat., he got hit with a DUI as well, especially since there was a child in the car apparently. As others have said, he had previous DUI's, and when you start stacking them they really throw the book at you.Yeah, I did what you said and googled “Liverpool heroin” and read the NPR article. Showed the three idiots who decided to post the pic. They think that because they’re posting everyone with a drug charge on Facebook that that is the reason for the drug problem going away. Yet in the same article it clearly shows it’s doing absolutely nothing. They’re just shaming people which, hello, isn’t helping an addict brain in the slightest. The pic they had of the 3 guys was just them looking so smug. NPR did a great job making them look quite dumb later in the article. Can you imagine? Last night my daughter asked how my dad died so I told her about brain tumors and then she became quite insecure about my mortality. Children are obviously very vulnerable for a long time and they know this instinctively. It's incredibly easy to inadvertently make mistakes and damage them. Yeah that police department is scummy af. They claimed that they needed to educate the public and that this was the final straw that pushed them to do so, however, when they published it faces and all it wasn’t to educate the people about fentanyl but specifically the “non-using public” so that they could bear witness to what they now “have to put up with every day”.But but THE PATRIARCHYYes, I loved that article.  NPR typically does a great job of shining the spotlight on stupid.   @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Moving on up!, Content: , ups: 560, downs: 0Congrats!Way to go man. Hell yeah! Congrats dude.

Congratulations!!Good job dude!Congratulations! ☺️Damn your coin is way more fancier them my three month coin[deleted]Congrats man!! That’s pretty  cool, all my meetings have are those cheap plastic keychains �Itanimulli demrifnoc\*CongratsYou’re doing amazing sweetie! (Don’t read it in that Kardashian meme way ��). But seriously you’re doing great, keep it up!!  I’m so proud of you! ��Props brother! I remember that chip fondly. Keep doing what you’re doing, dude. Do the masons have NA? That coin looks like something you'd get from the Masons.Congratulations, buddy!! Keep it upThats fucking inspiration man...you pretty much feel completely normal? Or dovyou have bouts with depression/anxiety?Congrats that’s a huge accomplishment !Aw fuck that lol unless I can walk in and they believe I haven’t drank for 3 years and gimme a medal then AA can lick my ass lol. Never found them helpful for me to quit drinking. 
But for you they have helped immensely so congrats my dude! Quitters never win!Thanks!Appreciate itIndeed. I’m not going to pretend it’s easy, but it’s getting easier. AAAA bro lolThanks budThanks bro!Thanks Thank you!��I wish you luck when you try again!Didn’t know that existed! I’ll check it out. Some of the groups around here give these brass ones instead of the plasticy aluminum ones. Not IMEDo I know you? � You’re so nice thanks!It’s actually AA. They are much stronger in the area that I’m in. Plus I have problems with alcohol too. Do you see how it says “to thine own self be true” on the coin? You could pick up a three year medallion drunk, no one in the room has to believe you. You could get any chip no problem.Yessir , I hope you keep moving forward so you can be an inspiration and motivation to us when we decide to make the brave choice you did , thank you We get plastic chips lmao i camt do aa makes me want to drink, an ive tried lots of meetings to many pushy people that want to jump in your life. Like nahh i dont need 5 different ppl calling me multiple times a day to see how im doing. Shit annoys me and triggers me.We’ve commented on each other’s stuff before :))Oh ok, but is it with the Masons?[deleted]Haha ok! Thanks again ☺️Have you ever heard of [SMART meetings](https://www.smartrecovery.org/)? If not, it might be worth looking into. They're not as numerous as NA/AA but I prefer their approach. It doesn't have a spiritual foundation but is instead based on scientific research, especially cognitive behavioral therapy.Sure am!Im sober off alcohol and opiates, which in my eyes is pretty sober. I do take kratom amd smoke weed. Those 2 things keep me sane, if i didnt have them id just keep relapsing on alcohol.I'll second this. I'm not much for any of those groups in general, but I've found SMART much more palatable than any AA/NA. Closest smart meeting to me is a good hour round trip not worth it for me or id try. I live in a area  where AA and NA is very prevalent. I honedtly wish i could find a meeting tht was smaller all the ones i go to have like a hundred people or more. I like more smaller groups that are more intimate. I get more out of them only place i found thise were in south florida. Also its hard for alot of the people there to understand my poly substance addiction. Plus i swear most of the people there arent even what i would consider alcoholic. When i drink i drink all day long for months at a time, i dont ever meet those ppl irl only on reddit. Can you please remove your location?

I thought it was Ambien.Fucking A good for him. This is how I know that unlimited funds and access would not make my addiction pleasant, when folks like this quit. Or kill themselves cause they can't quit. Opiate addiction steals your soul. We aren't meant to be numb, we aren't meant to feel that good all the time.Yes pain pills , also Valium and yes sleep medsThat man has unlimited drug money at all times. Any doctor would even write him any scripts he’d want for the right price. People in his life offer him drugs all the time. He’s one of the most famous rappers of all time.

If fucking HE can do it, so the fuck can you. 

One day at a time.Coincidentally it's been 11 years since he has released any good music.
But at least he's clean and he is still a brilliant rapper that released some great music.Y’all think he takes any narcotic meds that are RX’d to him like klonopin or something. Because I take adderall and Xanax and I’m also on methadone but I take my meds as prescribed so according to my old sponsor I’m clean.... it’s a fine line of what being clean actually is. I think he may take some low benzo because em’s always said he has had a problem with anxiety but I think he’s clean.Way to be Em!Gotta stay away from those blue & yellow purple pillsWhile in pharmacy school (1999), I learned a lot about prescription drugs from his songs!Found this:

https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0629/Marshall-Mathers-Prescription-drug-abuse-almost-killed-him-he-saysHe did alot of K-pins too11 years since his music has actually been good...Keep it up Slim ShShShShaaaaaaady!!!!I feel like this is a better interview. He talks in much more detail about his drug use and when he came so close to dying:


https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-on-the-road-back-from-hell-249093/If eminem can do it...i cantHow does one start doing vicodin and not switch to oxy? Only eminem knowsHe’s miserable, too now.Damn 11 years? Props I can’t go a day without feeling shitty or 11 hours without somethingDon't i fucking wish.He was better on drugsReminds me, I remember I was sitting in the car with an old friend about to slam.
He then proceeded to show me his 1 year sober chip he got in prison.What a fucking quitter! /s

Seriously tho good for him. Dude almost died in the hospital one timeProps to him. I have been a huge fan since he came onto the scene back in '96. His music has had it's up's and down's, but he is hands down a lyrical genius, and one of the best rappers that have ever lived. He does not get the prop's he deservesWhat was his main drug of choice?Been a little longer than that since he’s made anything worth listening too     NoGod is great. I’m wondering about his 12th step work and how it looks like considering he is a celebrity. I’m sure many people try to manipulate. 

I’m glad he is seeking god and trying to build his spiritualityWho caresI’m not sure, i just thought people would appreciate it!he had a major vicodin problem that he talks about in his songs - mostly valium and vicodin thoughHe had an everything addiction. “Vic’s perch and methadone pills” is a lyric in going through changes. Also sleeping pills and ValiumI thought it was primarily benzos....among other thingsI have his old CD I'm pretty sure it's a broken Vicodin on the disc itselfHe has a weird list of drugs he takes, it was ambien, and Lortabs, mushrooms, weed, and he’s said methadone before in song but I don’t think he was a heavy opiate user.

Edit- I take that back, he might have been a heavy opiate user idk, I’ve just never heard him talk about withdrawals like ever from opiates, you think that’s something he would rhyme about but I don’t think he ever said he at 30 30’s like dude up top said.Pretty sure he had a poly-substance abuse problem. He took a LOT of different drugs because he could. Most drug addicts have a hard time supporting their main drug of choice habit and if they got to add another drug once in a while it was a treat.Yes. He OD'ed on methadoneHe started eating Methadone pills as well, which is what he overdosed on.Heard at one point he was doing 30 30s a day he saidIt was Ambien, Valium, vicodin, and methadonehe Od'd on methadone onceHe did.  He was addicted to all sorts of different pills including Vicodin.  At some point he ended up OD'ing on Methadone, not sure how, but that was the catalyst that forced his life change.I thought he was on methadone for a whileTo be fair they can also afford the best support systems lolTrue that!FaxualBut he has never had to be a homeless junkie on the streets or doing gay4pay for his next shot. Or wanted treatment but been unable to afford it. Etc. 

Just cause X can do it doesn't mean Y can do it. Some people can, and some people can't because they don't really want it and can't commit or they can't cause they lack the resourcesHim being able to do it has absolutely nothing to do with another person. Our brains are all very different. So.. what you said is dumb.I have the exact same opinion. He was way better on drugs.Yeah thats why clean is a subjective term. To many you're not clean but you are in recovery. The words clean and sober often end up being harmful and exclusive to other approaches to recoverytbh you have or you are prone to have the same problems he had, its not like he went through a fent or etizolam addictioni doubt it. he's had problems with valium and prob other benzos in the pastFor real!That’s awesome!Interesting read!Brain dead like Jim BradyFeel dat!I definitely think he does get the props he deserves tbh. Especially with all the eminem stans there areHe’s doing it right, he doesn’t mention the program much hents the anonymous part of the program but he does have the recovery triangle necklaces he wears everyday.I know i care. Even if hes famous, and im not a super fan of his music hes still someone who got out.Vicodin, adderall, and ambien mainly“I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him”Doesn’t he have a Vicodin tattoo? Could be confusing him with someone else.I guess having unlimited money isn't always a good thing...That’s insaneSource pleaseHoly shit.I remember reading that it was 40-60 Valium a day he said he was taking. Which is a shit ton of benzos on top of Vicodin, ambien, and methadone which is what lead to his bad OD n almost died.At one point in my addiction I was doing 10 of em a day....I couldn’t even imagine building up a tolerance that would allow 30 per day.He NEVER took oxy unless it was a percocet or percodan tho so this is false. He OD'd cuz he went from taking vics to methadone all while being on high dosages of valium... He never took roxies, ever. He would have been much smarter to take roxies tho over the methadone but he obviously didnt know shit about the drugs he was taking and abusing and hence why he OD'd...Absolutely. If only we all had access to rehab and great doctors!When you learn and accept that life’s going to have absolutely terrible and extremely great days, you really learn to find peace within yourself and not get caught up in whatever moment you’re in.right but for him, there would be absolutely no downside to just staying on pills for the rest of his life. he could EASILY obtain them, and keep it a secret due to virtually endless supply and/or doctors that give him what he asks. 

i would argue that it’s actually much harder to continue staying sober in his situation, because there would be absolutely zero incentive dude.

think about it.

he doesn’t have to sacrifice ANYTHING for opiates, so giving them up would be so much harder than a junkie who has given up everything for them. the incentive comes purely from within him, with absolutely zero external pressure to stay sober.that's a similar excuse to saying 'I'm big boned/have bad genetics, so I can't lose weight'. Like, yeah, people do have different brain chemistries and it might make it much harder for one person to get clean compared to another, but pretty much anyone can do it if you have the will.You're a bit incorrect. Anybody can do it. Its just a matter of want/will to do itYup, i fucking hate when people say that. If that was the case, i would've been done quit. If i can do it, *anyone* can! Yeah, ok.ppl downvoting you have no idea what being addicted is about
also plz, there is no such thing as 'unlimited money for drugs' 

not to mention its a disrespect with people going through hell iv'ing fent, heroin, etizolam, smoking crack/iv'ing coke to be compared and judged because eminem who was addicted to fucking diazepam, ambien and fucking vicodin managed to stop

please stop thisI found an even better one here:

https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-on-the-road-back-from-hell-249093/I never heard adderall as something he did commonly. May be true tho. From his lyrics it seems like he did a ton of benzos on top of Vicodin and ambien.

I think he did an interview on ecstasy too.Uppers was not something Em did on the regular at all... It was vicodin, valium and ambien. Started with ambien and then got a hold of some vicodin and valium from people and doctors being stressed out and over worked from shows and tours... eventually he got addicted and was taking it daily. His main issue was valium tho as he took like 30-40 of them in a day sometimes. 

Then he OD'd cuz he was sold methadone instead of vicodin cuz he always complained the vics made his stomach hurt so the dude was like here these will be easier on ur liver and he took em and loved em and kept taking em not realizing that shit builds up in system and doesnt wear off completely like vics do after a couple hours... Honestly Em seems like a idiot and was just asking for an OD if u ask me. He didnt know shit about the drugs we was taking and even said he didnt have his first beer till after he was in his early 20's... The dude went from taking vicodin to methadone, all while taking massive amounts of benzos... stupid af... Like there are so many other opiates he could have taken instead that would have been way better for his liver/stomach and yet still stronger than the vics like roxies or percocet even ( I kno is has tylenol too but he would need a lot less compared to the vics to get fucked up) or hell even oxycontin or morphine tabs... No one goes from vics to methadone unless they are super drug naive. And he never talked about it with anyone cuz he always wanted to hide it so its not like anyone was telling him this shit even tho he must of had some shitty ass dealers tho... If I was supplying Em and he said the vics hurt his stomach, my first reaction would not be, oh well heres some methadone instead, like wtf? I would have told him to try some roxies or oxycontin instead... u know, the normal tolerance progression road most users take...esp knowing he was on such a high dose of valium as well... The OD could have easily been avoided... Then he said the doc told him "he had the equivalent of 4 bags of heroin in his system..." Like wtf, leave it to a doc to say some whack ass shit like that... no1, heroin ranges in potency so 4 bags could mean literally anything as u never kno the strength and no2, it wasnt the opiates that caused the OD alone, it was the fact that he had an insane amount of valium in his system and then all that methadone stacked on top... so the doc could have said he had 100 bags of dope in his system when he OD'd, it wouldnt change the fact that it was the combo of a long ass acting opiate and large dose of benzos that fucked him over. Tbh, I bet he would of had a much greater chance of NOT ODing if he had used 4 bags of dope instead of taking all that methadone... lolsickest line about vicodin ever.In most cases you're right but in this case his money could have saved his life. Imagine having that drug habit and not being rich. He could have been doing illegal shit to get it or he could have been doing heroin. Either one of those things could have very easily killed him or put him in prison as it does for a lot of people. A habit with pharmaceutical opiates is a lot safer and having all that money probably isn't what caused his addiction to begin with; it just made it so he could do safer drugs.This was probably back when 30s would be 5-10 bucks on the street. People only wanted 80s back then.I wish I could find it. I could of swore he mentioned doing this much during a tour with Dre. I forget which one. I know for a fact he often took Vicodin and Valium tho.People gotta remember, oxy 30s used to be the cheapest drug you could get. A lot of people had 1g/day habits. :/Shit, even people that do have access to all that don't make it. I have Medicaid and can go to a variety of detoxes and rehabs/long-term programs in addition to family that will help me any way they can without enabling me, and I'm still struggling like crazy to get clean. In and out of treatment like it's going out of style. I want to stop using but just fucking can't. People say i just don't want it badly enough. I just don't know wtf is wrong with me. Sorry for the rant and good for Marshall, I'm sure no matter how much money he has or what kind of support systems he has, it wasn't/isn't easy.why tf are so many more of them terrible :(I like that thoughtThis is deepHe didn’t even need to keep it a secret he was openly fucked on drugs and still making money putting out songs and doing gigs. He def could of just continued it if he wanted toI personally disagree  in some regard but I do agree with some of your points. I guess my ultimate conclusion is there is no tangible way to compare the true difficulty overall of his recovery versus another person's. It's not really measurable imo because there are so many factors and elements that tie into each individual person's experience with sobriety. 

I do understand why it is easier for him in his situation to end up struggling to get clean. But I guess what I mean is if you take Eminem - taking him hypothetically let's say he wants to commit and is ready. And you take another person who equally wants it but instead of eminem's money, treatment options, potential support system, Etc everything that does work in his favor... this person is homeless, stealing or doing like sex work to support their habit,  jobless and broke, lacking family and friends that haven't disowned them, no insurance or accessible treatment because of money.  Etc. Then person 2 is gonna have it worse. 

I guess it all boils down to wanting it or not. I do see all your points yeah it would be extremely hard for eminem to continue recovery long term. And I don't disagree with it being in some ways even harder. Really I suppose I was just looking at a flip side perspective. There's no right answer thoNo, it's like saying "food addiction is real and it's not as easy for one person to lose weight as for another". Which it is... coming from someone who lost 70lbLolLol you are so uneducated.Right... no one person is the same! One person can get through being abused as a kid... the next will be fucked up for life.... goes like that with any problem in life. Thats what mental illness is. The people who dont understand obviously didnt have depression BEFORE ever using.So his addiction and mental health issues are invalidated because he was addicted to pharma pills? Addiction is addiction. The dick measuring in this sub is ridiculous sometimes. I am a poly-sub addict, and I was addicted to pharma pills. My addiction was/is just as life altering and destroying as a heroin addicts, or a crack heads. I have also been addicted to crack, and meth at different points in my life, and addiction is addiction, regardless. To say that only IV users really know what it's like to suffer from addiction is bullshit. When your life is being ruled by a drug, the ROA of that drug is irrelevant.I’ve read somewhere that most of the Marshall Mathers LP Eminem was on ecstay doing 12 hour “creative binges” in the booth with DreI remember him saying he was taking a lot of ValiumHe has a lot about mdma in his less popular songs. I always figured that was his main thing.Yeah back in the good dayTrue. People would "settle" for 30s when the 80s and 120s were out of stock. The "doctor" would dispense 180 30s for $240Bruh I remember when 30s were cheap af. And THE REAL OC 80s!! Ohhhh the taste.Getting clean isn’t the hardest for me it’s staying clean, finding a reason to want to live feeling anxious and nervous fucking sucked. I hated the AA program and got to the core problems and treated my anxiety and depression and now I want to stay clean. Good luck bro I hope you find peace.where I live the relapse rate for people who go to rehabs is higher than 99%, Brazil

I've been forced to detox myself 11 times on terrible places and ofc I've never won any vice fight and I am okay with the fact that I will take methadone for life, its better than having to hustle for morphine or oxies, there are no opiate addicts over here except for me and 10 other people lmao (not even kidding), they have no clue on how to treat opiate addictionWhen he was using, he was literally the most popular artist on the planet.I agree with you. Once someone does shameful things like sex work, AND are homeless staying in hotels or with some weird old guy with no insurance or bullshit state health insurance its hard to get out of that kind of hole. The shame alone is deadly, then struggling trying to find help is overwhelming because there isn't really any...... but some people do have health conditions that make losing weight infinitely harder. Same thing with addiction, there are different conditions to each situation that can easily make one harder than the other. Congrats on the 70lbs seriously but just cause you lost that much weight doesn't mean someone that happens to have X health condition can just as easily lose the same weight.Oh please educate meHe's actually not uneducated. It is true that the will/desire is the ultimate factor necessary for successful long term recovery. What about that is it you are convinced is wrong ?Damn, apparently people really disagree with us. It's like my parents saying, your brother went to detox then rehab once and has four years now- why the fuck can't you do it? Oh, IDK, maybe i just love the miserable junkie lifestyle that much? I mean, i get it in terms of encouragement, but beyond that, it's pretty meaningless and even  condescending/demeaning on some level. If *I* can do it, you can too, wherein since i can and you can't, there must be something wrong with you or lacking- but that's just me being bitter and over-analyzing.I dont think anyone suggested that, no idea what are you even talking about lmao

you know whats beyond ridiculous? acting as if he went through hell, thats ridiculous

put yourself on his shoes because thats exactly what I did and then I realized I'd 'win' any fight vs a vicodin addiction

edit; its hilarious that you mentioned dick measuring because I havent even mentioned myself yet you did, projecting way too much? I never said that iv'ing was the only ROA that would make addicts suffer, where did you get this from? LMFAO

also I just realized the sub we are in but at first I thought we were somewhere else

also its hideous that you, yourself spinderella is saying that his addiction can be compared to the regular joe whos addicted to IV'ing fent or smoking crack, dont you realize this? seriously, I am not even kidding here

you used to be a more coherent and concise person, not sure whats going on anymoreso you decided to ignore how arrogant and stubborn you were and just downvoted me

way to go mod, lmfaoOr 180 20s for a $20 copay monthly in my caseFuckkk if onlyyyy it was still like that these days. I cant even imagine 120mg in 1 pill let alone 80mg in a pill lol now people are crazy over the 30s and packijg 30 mg into those is wild. Ahhhh oxy i lovr you but hate you so muchTHEY NEVER HAD 120mg OXYCONTIN IN THE US!!! I dont get why people cant understand this... The highest mg of oxycontin in the states was 80mg unless u consider the 2 year window when the 160mg blue oblong tablets were manufactured and sold in the US but that was only from 2000-02, way b4 the big oxycontin craze really took off so most users never even got to try one of those. The 120mg round purple/grey tabs u see people posting on here once in a while are only distributed in EU countries like Italy.. They arent available anywhere else. They never had the 160s anywhere but in the US and again, it was only from 2000-02. 

And if a doc is writing a legit script, why would a pharmacy be out of stock? U could just take the script to a different pharmacy and get it filled there... I agree that people only wanted roxies when OCs werent around and most wouldnt pay more than $5-7 for one but unless ur talking about dealers as "doctors" then ur statement makes no sense.Oh my God, this comment is so fucking true from top to bottom. That, “...finding a reason to want to live (while) feeling anxious and nervous fucking suck(s)”. This 110%. I’m so happy your anxiety and depression is under control!!! I’ve been abstinent from Heroin for about 5 1/2 months now and yet my anxiety is still horrible. My depression just drops by to say hello occasionally, I thank God it’s not horrible every day like it was in the past. May I ask what you’re doing now that has you feeling less anxious and less depressed?I work in BRA a lot, it seems coke and stims of any kind are the go to drugs.Absolutely. It's very hard. Possible but insanely hard..I agree with you? I think both food addiction and drug addiction are personal, and it can be easier for one person to break them but not another. I just added the personal bit because I'm proud of it.I would have to care about you to downvote you. Someone else downvoted your post. I chose not to respond to you, because I didn't care enough to.This was Florida pill mill days they didn't take ins. Cash only. You could go to 5 different ones in a week no problemThe people running out were the people that sold them on the streets. 120s were sold on the streets. My doctors dispensed 30s to me in office.  I called them "doctors" because they just wrote scripts all day to anyone.I got tired of trying to live how everybody else wanted me to live so I went back on medications for my social anxiety ptsd and depression. People frown upon taking klonopin and adderall because they are narcotic but if taken as prescribed like I do, I was able to get my life back, working 2 jobs, saving money, I’m just a lot happier. Screw what everybody else thinks, my life has improved drastically. Nobody needs to know about what medications I take except me and my doctor, the AA/NA program told me I wasn’t clean because I was using medication as a crutch. I’ve done 14 month totally clean of everything while working the steps and completing them and it was honestly the worst time of my life, I had things back like my health and money but the panic attacks, isolation, and depression were not worth it.yeah thats because you are paying 1.5 USD for a 3.5g sealed bag of 70~80% purity cocaine @ the streets over here

oxies, morphine (oral roa only), viminol are 100% OTC but people wont bother abusing these when you can get coke for so cheapThankfully im not in that position anymore, never plan to be again either. It always ended in robbery though. Fuck, yeah bad times. Thankfully though a few years ago.

The shame though! I haven't even told my psychiatrist or counselor yet.Okay then in that case I guess I must have somehow misunderstood your comment I apologize. And btw I wasn't trying to invalidate or take away from you the weight loss achievement, its something to be proud of and I mistook your adding it in being for a reason other than what you meant. My bad> I would have to care about you to downvote you

> I chose not to respond to you, because I didn't care enough to.

capitalizing and punctuating stuff while contradicting yourself for the third time in a row in the most attention whore manner

jesus fuck LMFAONo, you didnt respond because you fucked up royally distorting everything I said and you have zero respect to people who are simply trying to keep up a conversation without being offensive

its very unlikely for anyone to downvote me considering how dumb and manipulative you were at first and didn't apologize when being called out, its okay tho, atleast people get to know how manipulative and nasty you are

always respected you and your ideas but everyone end up showing their true colors, right?

have a wonderful dayNot an issue. It was kind of odd to add it, I'm just saying I went through the food addiction issue and still struggle with it. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Rehab friend posted this on fb, Content: , ups: 550, downs: 0I used to be racist until I got addicted to drugs


Heard that from someone, got a laugh outta that. He wasn’t being serious, just a joke Sick name rickyyy spanishhhhhhhLmao sameLol i always use “name cell” so it looks like a mobile phone number for someone but in my head I know it’s a sell phone number 6s, 7s, last resort, and good up are my connect names hahahahahaLMFAO. My favorite is "not my drug dealer" I always have "B" on mine from when I was prescribed blues. So like (fake name obv) "Adam B FL" or "Danny B LA".

The LA/FL is obviously for if it's for Florida or Louisiana. I don't think I've had an issue with somebody's last name starting with B because I'd probably not include the last name or would put the entire thing.

To anybody else it just looks like an initial. Can do the same with H. My favorite was always "not my drug dealer" lol How was rehab?I do not understand. My rehab friends post the best memesI just use a name of a girl that sounds like their own. > "Rehab friend posted this on fb"

Obvious meme has meme account @adamthehousecat watermark O_oI always said I ain't trying to buy dope from a white dude lol. Was only half serious and actually one of my best plugs was whiteSo he was still racist after getting addicted to drugs? Clever6s 7s? Started out with blues a long time ago and did the same thing. "Connect name B". That way if my main guy wasnt answering and I was desperate I could scroll thru the 292738 contacts in my phone and easily find the other connects. Wow never heard anyone else say this before I would do this but then I began having too many “Cody B’s” and “Ryan B’s” so I started mixing it and putting a spin-off on it by where I meet them. Mac Donnie(s) = McDonald’s, Sevie Elvie = 711, Walter Mart = Wal Mart Unfortunately a waste of time. Wasnt ready to stop on my own. I went because my family was pressuring me to try inpatient actual rehab after outpatient didnt work a few times. Did like 40 days total including a 5 day detox as well. Both the detox and rehab were beautiful places. The rehab put you up in a marriot hotel.. met alot of good ppl.. learned alot. But yeah I wasnt ready to stop. The good thing is though is that I genuinely feel like I'm gonna stop soon. Idk it's been like 10-15 years total of this shit and I'm almost there I think being ready to stop because I want to for the first time. We'll see how it goes."Black Dude I Buy Drugs From" is the name assigned in the blue messager's phone to the grey text messager, who just requested to be labeled something innocuous in said phone. I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. I feel like your trying to call me out saying I took a meme from a meme account. If that's the case miss me with that shit. And if you provide me with a way.. I can text or email you a screenshot of it. Groups of people and that’s what they call them selves. $6 bags and $7 bagsHaha yeah when I first started doing it... it's actually kind of a mean story, a middle I knew was a very reliable source but I had to hand off funds and she always took one (and charged me more than they cost - I don't mind charging a bit more or asking for one but not both, even when I found out the real price she still lied but that's another story). Anyways she was just... gross. Huge and just, you know, not an attractive girl. I don't usually base things off of people's appearances but for this story I have to.

Anyways, I didn't have many people in my phone and was going to save her as (different name) "Jessica Blue" but thought that was too obvious and changed it to "Jessica Bleagh" (like the "yuck" sound, "blech!") due to the aforementioned appearance, which I realize was kind of dick, and (mostly) to the fact that I was pissed she was lying to me for more money every time even after I'd flat out caught her.

Funny story as to how I eventually found out for sure she was lying to me about the price (because they never admit it so you can never REALLY be 100%) is that she called her connect to set up the deal after talking to me but called me back instead so she flat out said how many she wanted and what the total would be. Once she realized it was me she backtracked and tried to cover, then acted like SHE was mad at ME for not identifying myself, anything she could do to try to make up for the fact that she'd just told me the real price. I couldn't believe the fuckup on her part.

Anyways, back to the contacts thing, one day she was going to use my phone so I changed it to just "b" in case she happened to see her own contact and I realized that was way better. Been my go-to for.. Jesus Christ, over a decade almost. I can't believe how long it's been, and I hate when I do because it makes me realize how much of my fucking life I've wasted, shit. I'm in the same boat as you dude. I'm so sick of this lifestyle. I used to smile putting a needle of Dilaudid in my arm. Now I shoot some heroin and read. I don't enjoy it anymore. It's been 10 years of this shit. I've been clean like 6 days now. *sheds single tear* 

The hero we need, but don't deserve.No... Just that your friend isn't this meme account, and you're an idiot if you think this really happened to him.

This was made for entertainment by a meme account.

What you did or what you believe is irrelevant. Nobody accused you of being intelligent.Lmao got it Yea can’t stand a stingy middle

Had a guy that wanted 10 in gas and damn near half of what I was getting ONTOP of a waxed price

So one day he went in the store and left his tablet in there(he used one of those text apps) and dumbass didn’t have a code on it Litterly took all the numbers out and on to my phone

And since he was a stingy dickhead his whole life I told people to just come thru from me instead (told them actual prices and wanted significantly less then he did)

So not only I got out on him for his numbers AND his people lmao this was when I first started doing dope to massive comeup FUCK middles deal with they’re shit long enough to get the numbers and leave em in the dustHa, mine we're all labeled as pizza places, like "best sf pizza"Shit I'd do anything to be on day 6. The first 5ish or so days of total agony are over. Good shit man for real I know it still sucks but the horrible part is almost over just keep going!!holy shit a bunch of yall couldnt figure this out?All I said was that my friend posted this on Facebook. At no point did I say he created it. Obviously everyone sees the watermark. Once again miss me with that shit. Everyone enjoyed it. 300 something upvotes and you had to be the 1 out of 300 that had to be a douche. I have nothing but love to give to this sub.. it's just ppl like you.. like why are you trying to come at me? Why not just fit in with the rest of the group and be normal and just enjoy the shit? Think about it 1 out of 300.  I'll give it to you.. you're definitely something else. Have a good day. 

Edit now 430 ppl so you're 1 out of 430.Hahaha yeah that's how I got that middle actually. I had to use ANOTHER middle to get them, it was the fucking worst. I'd go pick up the first girl, go with her to pick up the middle, then all go to do the deal. Was a fucking nightmare but I didn't know anyone.

So one time we stop at a gas station. Usually she tried not to let us be alone, but I had gone in to buy something and the middle (the second) came in after. She came up to me and said how stupid it was to have to pay two people and gave me her number.

I had been calling the first one every few days so once I stopped she knew what was up. Whatever, fuck her. I get trying to get your piece, but people that are "friends" but put the dope first and try to rip you off this way can fuck off. Any time a friend had asked me for a connect, I give it to them. All I do first is call the guy to ask them if it's alright to give their number. OMG me and one of my guys talk about pizza! Hey you got any pizza? Is it that pizza with the chunky sauce? Hey, same pizza as last time or new pizza? I didn't like that pizza with the really white sauce, the darker one was better. Hey man that last pizza was all soggy and I couldn't eat it.

Hey man I'm starving to death over here, you made a pizza yet?

It works surprisingly well. Same. All were pizza places, all talk was in terms of pizza, etc. Fucking expensive pizza.�Is kratom legal where you live? That can help you to get off while avoiding the worse withdrawal symptoms, it even handles low level cravings. Kratom helped me get off of heroin and now I have 3 months clean. It feels a lot longer than 3 months lolLol I was jokingRight, no one accused you of being intelligent.

Bro get a life wtf are you worried about? 1 comment about how you took this from a meme page and say it was from "your friend"?

Why do you even care?

Why are you so sensitive?

Take your 300 upvotes and go jerk off you fucking cuck

Edit:

You make me feel like I'm beating up a retarded child bruhI do alot of middleing and that's how i usually do it if we're good pals it's eather hook me up and get it at cost or pay a tax and don't hook me up...get a kick out of ppl who r surprised when u want to get hooked up ...there like i only got x amount..well felony's are not free..i get n the same amount of shit if u get 2 bags or 2 gramsAH!  Im so glad Im not alone lol, at one point someone looked at my phone and commented that I really like pizza.  I was like yup, sure do :)To be honest I'm not even sure if it's legal by me. I'm in a very popular NE city. I've been living this life for a long time & I've never not once seen kratom. Read on here all the time smoke shops have it but I know the ones by me dont & I've never seen it on the street. I used to either get a legit script for subs or get them off the street but I never liked subs. My last detox i did a 4 or 5 day methadone taper in an actual facility and it was the best experience I've had detoxing.. practically painless. If and when I'm ready to get clean I'd prob do that again. I was expecting WDs when I got out of detox after the methadone but they were really mild. No hot and cold sweats shits none of that.. just that really sluggish body feels like it weighs 1000 pounds feeling which for me.is tolerable. I'm totally fine with that, just be straight up about it. Don't tax it but tell me you're doing it for free and trying to be my friend, because I will immediately never trust you again. Don't make me throw you something AND tax me on top of it. I get you have the control in the situation, and I get that in this lifestyle it's basically every man for himself, but there should still be some level of decency (especially between friends). There's nothing wrong with getting your cut - I get the risk taking explanation but even if there was NO risk you still deserve it - just be up-front about it. Haha yeah. That's why I did it, plus just in case the other guy ever gets grabbed or something that's easy to deny. I should do it with my other guys too tbhWell said my dude.Ur rite i like to play the game as fair as possible 
And try to b straight up with ppl..like i said no tax and get me well or pay a tax..if it's some weasel then i may tax em n want a shot..but there not many good ppl left in the game everyone out for themselves​ @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Shits too real:(, Content: , ups: 543, downs: 0This is pretty funny, although most of our plugs are like "now get tf off the block before you do that shit !"epic meme very repostI hope there's no afterlife.

My dad passed away last month stage 4 cancer, we’re about to go homeless now, I have PTI that I might not have the money for trying to not go homeless, my mom has open heart surgery last month, had relationship problems last month now getting better, almost out of food in my house, might not have gas money to get to PTI, I work my ass off just everything happened at once. I quit doing opiates but other than that man life fucking sucks and I’m scared asf being homeless or possible jail.... an I’m only 23 years old my goal for college is literally 0% at the moment, always wanted to go. I love this episode ���I thought I had hit rock bottom... Then found out there's a basement I’ve hit a point in my life where almost every day I take kratom and watch it’s always sunny at night by myself and it’s starting to make sad. LOL unrelated but when people say BIG FUCKING FACTS BRUH I wanna be like, those are xtra small facts Julio. And that shit you said about Lloyds sister? Cornelius thinks it's medium-rare facts.That's one of my all-time favorite parts on the show. Haha!DISCLAIMER: Found this on Facebook, not my meme but I thought all my junkster friends would get a hyuck-hyuckster out of it � *awkward laugh at my shitty punny rhyme I love so much*Lmfao Normius RepostusrerereREEEEPOSTUS MC.POSTINGTONUSOh man my prayers and best wishes go out to you man.... I am so sorry you are literally a trooper and bless you for staying sober.I’m so sorry to hear this. There are resources you can try to reach out to for help to prevent eviction. Are you being evicted because you haven’t paid bills?

As for food... look up food pantry’s in your area. Also... you’re going through a really tough time right now. Hang in there. Things will get better. Your goal of college may not be possible this very minute, but it could be in the future. Have you talked to a financial aid counselor recently? Since the loss of you Dad and assuming your mom isn’t making a whole lot of money, you may be eligible for grants and student loans to cover living expenses and tuition. Don’t give up on this goal. It may be delayed compared to your original plan, but it’s still a possibility. Stay strong brother.Just for today my brother, I hear where your at just hang in there just for today much love Look on back of your gas/power bill. There is usually a phone number to call if you are having trouble paying your bill. Ive used it before and there are non-profit organizations who will help you pay your bill . Even if it's about to get cut offI'm so sorry you've had to go through this. I don't know if you're religious, (I don't really know if I am either) but I'll be praying for you tonight. If there's anything I, or anyone else on this subreddit could do to help, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck bud. 
Sending my love and prayers - K[deleted]Why does it make you sad?so basically i adjusted the root of an onion's wheel to match the scroutus of you rice jenklings, then subsided gender and glimmer ratio to find how long the flungus had to be stretched to appropriately execute this particular type of mandingus.

not that complicated..The facts are 5 inches by 8 inches It's from Facebook so I suppose you're right. I haven't seen it on the opiates sub tho and I thought some might find it funny :)I'll pray for you too. I been paying bills like water and electric. My mom needs electric because of her meds for her heart the refrigerator plus food. Then we gotta also stay clean for my job. It’s just rent is $850 and we don’t have it and it’s the end of the month. Good ideaI hope man my mom isn’t making any money right now she can’t work. I’m the only one but all my money has to go to PTI at a bad time. Plus my mom applied for SSI, my dads death cert, and disability but that can take forever with the government. What? Haha penis tract?  Is that the scientific term? ��Because I’ve developed a reputation amongst my friends of being the burn out who works a dead end job and watches it’s always sunny every night. That...... was....... BOUNTIFULLY BOOTIFULCall my dick big facts because it's the truth, 



...... and uh bigyeaa its been here once or twice.
but im just jacking your raisin druggy balls tho ;)Lol thanks? I can't tell if this is being nice or sarcastic because I'm a dope feenYou may want to contact local churches in your area to see if they can help with rent this month. Catholic charities helps in my area. Maybe they help in yours as well. 

Also is your mom assigned a social worker/health navigator through wherever she received the surgery (check with the hospital). If not, contact the hospital that treated your dad and ask to speak with the cancer navigator. Let them know that since your Dad became ill that your mom doesn’t have rent money for this month and that she’s having trouble paying electric bills. They can set you up with resources to get aid. 

There are services to prevent becoming homeless in situations like this. It takes time to find them, but it’s worth not living on the streets. Plus your mom can’t live like that right now. You got this, friend. Life is really hard right now, but you can do it. Where’s do you live? In colder states they can not evict you in winter months [deleted][deleted]Have they said something to you about it? 

Maybe go outside and walk around?[deleted]I was not being sarcastic, so it must be the other. This was really kind of you.  Listen to this guy op you will beat this Unfortunately I live in South Carolina down South. But it still gets cold asf in the winter down here and my car heater is broken so fml! Great idea I don't recommend waiting to get the attorney for countless reasons, this "3rd time's a charm" thing utterly asinine, please do not take that bad advice as gospel. This is coming from someone that draws disability. 

She *DOES NOT* need to hesitate, that is the #1 reason why a given person is still waiting or what have you. Applying may also in and of itself help you keep your place. Call tomorrow! The first back payment alone will be a nice chunk, and again, the sooner the ball gets rolling, the better. Good luck. Oh lmao nah man PTI as in I got in a fight with a dude that started it but there making me take classes instead of jail which I’m grateful for. Honestly that was funny though man I’m sure it was sarcasm but never know. Must be huhNot sure where you are in SC, but in here Columbia, there is the Oliver Gospel Mission and Harvest Hope - both great places that offer assistance. Not an idea.. just sayin’ maybe he has a little more time than he thought to get things straight since he is concerned about being immediately homeless due to not being able to make rent this month. 

Edit: clarification [deleted]OkCringe @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Yup, Content: , ups: 535, downs: 0�����Im a junkie fr fr but could never steal my grandmas pain meds .....sorry mom n dad n sister n ex girlfrind tho�Love it lolYeah I steal my grandmas oxy all the time! She was an evil butch when I was growing up so I feel like it evens out! Haha..I've done this. She had cancer and passed last year and I still think about how big of a piece of shit I was every day. I'm clean now and I'm glad she got to see me clean up my life but I can't shake how terrible I was to her when I was using. Her and my grandfather both had cancer and I was staying with them. I would steal their pills, money, car and lie to them. My grandpa never got to see me get better but she did for a couple months. She never forgave me before she went and it kills me every day.Sorry nanathis one made me laugh �Yeah I admit I did shit like this when I was younger. I even replaced my own hydros with Tylenol in case my mother checked and wondered why the fuck they were gone.Or filling the hydro syrup back up with robitusson Lmfaooo that’s tuff Bahahahaha too funny. I lobe this opiod forum on reddit. Im a POS. I replaced my.dads hydros with tylenol and his xanax with muscle relaxers. Im a disgusting excuse for a human.Ouchu/h2_woe�������

It be like that tho Lmao been there with mom & dad’s meds. I’m not a total monster I waited until I knew they weren’t using  them after their surgeries Just take the bottle. She so old she’ll forget she had them. Oxy is like deer. It can be singular or plural. Please OP, Could your *junkie ass* use proper grammar when stealing grandma's oxy?yesss if ur here and haven't done that ur not a real one Any oxy in sight that is laying around like tylenol. Is basically mine. Theyre basically saying here, fuck the advil take soke of this mahical ozyķksk(sks1Yea it don't get much worse then denying an old sick person with cancer there constant doses of pain meds. Most elders in pain don't take it all day everyday so there tends to be lots laying around. I was about to steal my grandma's fetttie  patch off her chest while she was on her death bed. The only reason I didn't was because I'm sure the person I visited her with would have caught the blame. Funny how getting caught was more of a deterrant than depriving my grams of rent while dieing. SmdhI'll be honest with you, you should feel bad. You can't apologize to the dead, and they can't forgive you. I hope you learned from your mistake tho, which you stated. Addiction is q  fucking devili can imagine the only thing she wanted for you is to quit using. i think it’s the best thing you can do for yourself and your consciencelol it's funny that this would be downvoted when it's literally the same message as the meme and most of the other comments.Really? This? This is the hill? Ok..Bullshit. I'm as real as it gets. Been shooting dope almost 20 years. Literally spent over a million on heroin, that I worked for and earned.

You don't have to steal at all, especially from sick elderly people, to be a "real one". That's disgusting.[deleted]Honestly. Dude stole cancer medication from his *fucking dying family*. Doesn't get any lower than that. I tell myself that every day. I hope it's true. I hope that they can somehow see me and how good things are going now.Fr. I just left out the part where I talk about how I feel bad about it. Well right now that I have a full time job and all I wouldn't I get what u mean ,,, when I started doing pills I was round 16 I did steal other people's meds most of us have..This guy is bragging about shooting dope for 20 years and wasting a million dollars. Holy shit.Literally nodded off in the middle of the comment. Im doin a half of yellow perk ten for filler mixed with half a valium and half a pink oxy 10 and half a oxy 30. So im all fugged upjesus, he obviously knows. no need for everyone to line up to shit on him. i bet you've never done any kind of scummy junkie shit in your life.I stole some of my grandma's meds after she died from lung cancer , I never would have taken them from her while she was alive and in pain; thats hella fucked up.

I also took my dad's pain meds, but that was after he told me he hates opiates and they make him sick. I only stole a little over half of them, usually 2 or 3 every few days until he caught on that he was missing a bunch and he threw them away. 

Point of the story is, it's okay to take them if people either aint gonna miss them (cuz they kicked the bucket already), or if they are literally of no use to the person and they are gonna get thrown away. Ones man's trash is another man's treasure and all that.

I would never steal someones pain meds that need them to function/survive. Thats really fucked up, no matter if most people have done it or not. Normalizing stealing someones meds is not okay my dude.That's why I call bullshit.Why take half? I got 2 10 mg oxy pinks im bout to chew up rnPeople don’t *usually* need the pain meds to function/survive at all 

Another comments example was something a long the lines of “old people in pain don’t take them all day every day so there tends to be plenty just laying around” it’s not moral and it’s not okay but don’t act like you’re THAT much better than these people by buying and shooting a million dollars worth of heroin over a 20 year period instead of stealing a few pain pills lmao 

*I never stole a relatives pain meds btw, dead or alive*I kist take half to try to make everyrhijg last longer lmao these drugs cost to much but either way im getting fucked upYou don't make any sense. Half a perc 10 = 5. Half a 10 mg pink = 5. Just take one and save the other.

How did that go?Went ok, 3 day job turned into 6, then our plane broke � so we hired a local fixer to show us some beaches for the next 2 days while waiting for parts. Beautiful country side outside the slums, nice locals as well. 
Good man doesn't sound like a terrible time and definitely seems safer than the other options. Probably still seemed like you weren't far from home since we have our fair share of haitians.Yeah, reminded me of being in Lake Park � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Every upvote will be one minute that I'm sober., Content: stole this from the r/drunk guy on the front page and shot for a more realistic goal :o)

Got my first reddit gold in 4 years for it though lol. Found this sub reddit because of that comment. Gotta love redditYes. I think one guy was a month. He had to go to the ER. Ahh yes. The dreaded encounter with the concrete python. Don’t judge but I had to use my wife and I Astro glide once to lube up my rear end so it would slide out.  It worked pretty damn good!Hey that’s the only reason why I’m surfing this reddit! I’m actually quite intrigued people here are abusing and are addicted. I thought it was about pharmacology....
Damn. He got us. Discovered this sub from there and thanks for the laughs going through a shitty time and y’all made me chuckle *laughs in linzess*I know a junkie from my little town, he didn't pooped for 24days, I don't know if this was the cause, but now he has severe colon cancer... 
On nucynta for pain management. Legit haven't shat in four days. I just wanna poop man!I took a huge shit around midnight because I had my last little piece saved for my final time using before I try and kick again. After cleaning out my bowels pretty well, I did my first and last booty bump. I have never slammed and I know I couldn’t do it just once, so I prepped 0.3 of some tar and I sent that dark slime up my ass. I was nervous about it coming out so i jumped down on my stomach and laid there for about ten minutes. I got pretty high but still didn’t catch a nod. I don’t know why but no matter how much i do or how i administer it, heroin gives me speed like energy and meth calms me down. Pointless story but I shit at midnight.Two solid bowl movement today. Roll Tide.

Diet, exercise, and hydration are key if you dont want to feel like shit and not be able to shit.I went here from thatI’m glad I made you laugh :)

I wrote that right before going to bed and now when I woke up, I saw it had 14 k upvotes  xDYou can’t poop if you never eat... 
r/stimsonce a year Since 2008 (when I started getting on opiates) I’d go atleast 3-4 weeks without having any bowel movements. Now that I’ve been on Adderall for 2 years now as well I’ve found that it helps even out opiate constipation. I pooped like 4 times since 2018 endedI love you guysI came from there lolI came onto this subreddit because of that comment i giggle snorted
I’m currently on another few-week problem shits that I’m trying to resolve. It’s at that point where it’s starting to hurt my stomach, it’s kind of a cycle lol. I feel like I haven’t taken a proper shit in months.You ever push so hard you ejaculate?Taking a shit as I read this lmaoPretty sure I've got one stuck from '99How about for the ladies; who can go the longest without a period?? I’m looking to go three years in a rowFam I've made it CRAZY amounts of time without doing a NUMBER 2, Pretty sure when I FIRST got on the methadone, it took ages to adjust to my dose and I didn't go for 2 months (possibly even longer, that's how scared I was to go) . Needless to say, when I finally did go, it sounded like a demon was being exorcised. Obviously, I was controlling my eating during this period, and i'm not a big fan of food anyway so not eating for long amounts of time doesn't bother me. After you don't go for a week and then you have a 5lb shit it's called having a heroin baby.The relief is gonna be so sweet mannnnlmao, well, they aren't wrong...It was like right there almost crowning lol guiltyOh my God ���Is anyone familiar with skin problems due to what I can only assume is from long term constipation? The symptoms are like skin all over my body is constantly flaking and like shedding these little specs of black, grey, or tan. It’s like a plaque buildup on my nails and cuticles also. Been dealing with this purgatory for literally years. Been to dozens of doctors but no fix, maybe bc I don’t admit to them that I use Fentanyl and previously tar. Any help would be eternally appreciated, if I could pay for a cure no price would seem unreasonable, like this has been ruining my life.It was you!! 2.1k opiate users in 2 hours. I wish that was surprising. [deleted]Welcome come check out the place and see what it’s like to be an addict. I always enjoy people seeing what it’s really like because it somewhat de-stigmatizes it some what. 

My only concern is whenever we are mentioned on the front page or something we get a bunch of people coming here telling us to kill ourselves and we’re fucking junkie scum and all that. welcome, welcome.Yeah I hit 3 weeks one time. It felt like I had a 6 foot curved concrete turd in me. My hemorrhoids were under so much pressure my asshole probably looked like a head of cauliflower. It hurt to walk. After I started to vomit feces I knew I was close to dying. I went to the ER and they said, "you need to go poop, take a laxitive" and sent me home. Like I hadn't been eating them all day for a week. The next day I fought the beast for 5 hours, digging little bits out at a time with my index finger. At this point my asshole was raw, bleeding, and my hemmies felt like giant stretched out balloons. I took one more push with all the strength in my body and a Pringles can sized turd ripped my ass wide open. It was simultaneously the most painful and liberating feeling in my life. I couldn't wipe so I just got on all fours in the shower and let it clean me. I remember the feeling. Shaking. About to pass out. The feeling of the monster moving out of my ass before I could get my finger out. Horrible horrible month it was.OMGI heard a nurse ends up needing to use her hand at that point. Not sure how true My doctor recommended to put on a glove and then oil up my butthole and the inside of my anus with veggie oil right before I go to prevent tearing and to make it a little less painful. Seriously?my butthole is litterally in pain thinking about this.


i mean that generally the normal response once i start thinking, but that's not the point!That might have been meI'm sober now, but when I was in the throes of my addiction I'd sometimes bust out an enema. No judgements here �I've legit dug poop out my ass in desperation once. It was both discussing and satisfying at the same time.

I have severe RA and narcotics are my only source of pain relief.Thats true loveI can never get lube to work. I keep a box of latex gloves right next to the shitter for those stubborn days. ��
This place is full of degenerates and foul mouthed people doing stupid stuff. It's a wonderful place. pharmacology is discussed very frequently here. Hey man, tomato tomatoeI’m a chronic pain patient who takes her prescribed medication as directed, but I’m no better than anyone else here. And neither are you. I'm literally also only here cause of this post... But enjoying reading the stories here quite a bit! Praying for everyone here to have a safe year.

Edit: typo/r/stims is good tooHow do you find Nucynta for helping w pain? Ive only taken it recreationally and it was fucking awful for me. Made me feel 10x worse than I already did (withdrawals) so i wrote it off as “never touch again”. But ive heard it mentioned more and more in a postive light here recently. Same for me. I always attributed that to my ADHD. For 24 hoursI'd stare at a computer and learn how to build Android apps on meth. If I wanted the house clean I'd use opiates Too bad you couldn’t have timed it so one piece splashed down right at 11:59 and 9/10ths of a second and continued to splash until 12:00 and 1/10ths of a second while up above another piece had just breached the hole so you would have been probably one of very few who had the very last and first poop of the year.. 18&19 respectively.   
Well I guess we have something to aim for this year on New Years... only 363 days to go. I’m gonna go eat some fiber and Taco Bell.You shit so hard the bowl moved?

Haagen daz and heroinStay for the heroin and life of crime.Same lolShow off...Hahahahahah that's awesome! My ex wife went about that long too. 

Quick question. If you aren't having your period does that also mean you don't ovulate? Which in turn means you couldn't get pregnant? I'm one of us it's ok.[deleted]Vomiting …feces? YikesDear lord...This had be dying laughing at work partially because of how relatable it is...I write as I sit on the shitter excreting tiny rock hard pebbles of pooGod. Damn.Holy shitYou honestly just made me cry laughing. I am so sorry that shit happened to you, pun intended I guess.I loled. How could you go that far?!? I had my moments on methadone, but gd, 1 week is *forever* to not poop.He was a hurting dude. Usually true, or some kind of digging tool, or possibly even surgery. At that point things are so compacted bowel movements aren't possible anymore and it has to be removed by some other means. [deleted]i had to have what is called a ‘fecal disimpaction” done at one point. it was painful. they did give me IV dilaudid and ativan though which was nice. Also professionally known as *digital extraction*.Quite common. My mom was a nurse and I suffered from constipation as a kid. If I couldn't get it out, and was on the toilet crying and suffering. She would glove and lube up, and helped get it started to come out for me, as she was taught.
Nowadays the nurses tell you to do it yourself and hand you some gloves. Yes. I knew a woman who was very lucky to not get a colostomy bag. They removed several feet of dead intestine. So yes this can happen.Read my story in this thread. SeriouslyYes. I searched but nothing. I try to go every three days. After that, pain is a sure thing. I couldn't find your postYea enemas were my saving grace, is it bad that I looked forward to it, because it felt nice to get that outWhat's RA?I had to do that a couple of weeks ago. My poor boyfriend sat in the bathroom with me while I cried cuz I was in so much pain. The man is a trooper. “That’s black love.” — Whitney Houston, after husband Bobby Brown assisted her with this problem, using internal manipulation with his fingers. (For you youngsters, Whitney and Bobby had a reality show that followed their day-to-day lives, and this incident was documented.)I’m not an opiate user but I have used in the past and still visit this sub. Just want to say thank you for actually coming to the sub and not saying something disrespectful or unnecessary. There are good genuine people hear. 

Usually when this sub is mentioned else where it’s extremely talked down upon.If you shoot them it makes your butthole tingle.It's the only pain killer that for some reason I don't build much of a tolerance for, which is awesome because I hate upping doses on medications.

It's expensive AF though.

Thankfully my withdrawal symptoms when I stop cold turkey are pretty mild.

I like it for pain management :)Don't they give you amphetamines for adhd?The world needs people like us. Truly I honestly think the crazy can’t sit still dreamers and tinkerers with a hand in every pot kind of people drive creativity and invention and have pushed the human race towards all kinds of new and exciting and great things. Else we’d still be sitting around a fire that some guy made with sticks eating the same shit we did yesterday in some dark part of Africa or Europe. But one day a gene mutated and even though little eddy got yelled at a lot as a kid and was always in trouble he said fuuuuuck this I’m going over there with this stick and that one too maybe this rock hey where’d I put my other rock thing anyhow yeah I’m outta here.. few hundred thousand years later here I am same mutation from a long line of annoying always getting into trouble Eddy’s wondering what to do next.Unmedicated, working on 150 different projects I'll never finishHaha could have sworn I said bowel... I'm going to blame autocorrect. I am known to bring the thunder though. > side effects: withdrawal symptoms

Methylnaltrexone 14 thousand.. I got notifications and I mean if one of my posts or comments get a lot of upvotes I get happy? Woah that was the biggest mindfuck. 

I don’t think so though because I still have to be really careful about getting pregnant/giving birth to a opioid dependent baby... I don’t want to me THAT person ya know. Also I think we still go trough “PMS” everything but the blood... and pain. Sometimes I get frustrated or emotional and I think to myself “is this my phantom period...?”[deleted]WEEEEENYup. That's sign your colon is so full that your small intestine shoots nasty black bile shit up through your stomachReminds me of South Park when they are shitting out their mouth.>Vomiting ...feces?

There’s another condition that causes that but I can’t quite remember what it is. (Probably more than one, but one in particular I heard about not too long ago.)

It, too, was an intestinal blockage, but with a different underlying cause. Same result, though — feces eventually comes up the wrong way and ... horrorshow.Had it happen to me..  not from opiates but for an unknown reason. I was 14 at the time and it was horrible and scary. Ended up going to the ER after 19 days of no shitting and they put a tube up my nose all the way down my throat then into my stomach and they pumped 2 gallons of a special liquid into me and it took like 12 hours to kick in but once it did, I was shitting straight water. I was still in the hospital and if I didn’t have my butt cheeks clenched then shit would spray down my legs and everytime I stood up to go to the toilet I’d have extremely watery poop come out and it left a trail everytime :d 

They left the tube in for 2 days but took it out early because I ended up throwing up poop AGAIN and the tube came up and I started choking on it so the nurses came in after I was choking for 2 minutes and by the time they got there I was already UNCONSCIOUS 


When I left the hospital they weighed me and I lost 14 pounds i once went about 2 weeks.....after my time in the hospital.


being on methadone, vicodins, and not moving because of a broken leg made it so bad. I was one day from going to the ER. I was litterally crying in bed. I took like every laxative, enema, magnesium sulfate, etc. Like I couldn't even pee, that's how constipated i was


then at 3AM....the whole house was greeted to my shouting "AHAHAHAHAHA!!!! FUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK YOOOOOU!!!"


to which i heard my dad shout in a half awake voice "get that shit outta here!"


XD[deleted]This is how you scare kids off of drugs*nods knowingly*>fecal disimpaction

I'm saddened this isn't a Cannibal Corpse or Dying Fetus songI dont know if i could ever look at my mom the same way after her fingers being in my bunghole..Fuck!!Oh it was a comment months ago. I hadn't shat in like a month I eventually had to go to the ER for an emergency enema in the middle of the nightThere are few things in this world that provide such relief and euphoria as finally managing a shit after a week or two. 

I solved my two-week stint with loads of spicy food and gallons of coffee. I've left the experience behind, but have been carrying the resulting caffeine addiction since. It was the only thing that ensured I had a daily movement for a while after that. Rhumeatoid ArthritisRheumatoid arthritisI'd guess possibly rheumatoid arthritis Tianeptine (highly discourage anyone from shooting Tia. Very dumb)  would do that same thing. First time i thought i like pissed myself or something. HahaYes but it has a milder effect for us with adhd than for those without. It does still stimulate to a degree but at the same time helps focuses the mind ON ONE THING. The inability to stay focused for any good period of time is probably the worst of the symptoms of the disorder. Welcome to the Thunderdome!Both were just jokes. Yeah I understand how it works and it really was a clever comment. It takes on a new meaning here where a good poop is an event not just a daily occurrence.Damn son! Sounds fucking roughThe relief is intense. Dear God, I'm so sorry! I had gone about that long myself, and it was beyond a horrific experience getting that "concrete shit baby" out! 
I mean, I bled, for months after, everytime I had to go #2. I wouldn't want to eat even when starving bc ik it would have to come out and it was so painful my body and mind was like fuck eating. I drank alot of ensure and smoothirs during that time, but still. Anyway sorry if TMI. I just dont think people quite understand how absolutely painful extreme constipation and the aftermath can be. I had one when I first got on methadone that was literally ass cheek bone to ass cheek bone and the size of a softball. It was also a 2 weeker.I can honestly say I have gone at least 3 1/2 weeks to 4 without any movement in my bowels. Bf was freaking out, saying I have to go to the ER! I have never in my life been regular, but I did have to deal with the discomfort, on H that all disappeared, you don’t have a digestive system anymore! It just goes into hibernation! And yes the most intense was the almost 4 week mark, but I had to remind him 4 out of 7 days I wasn’t eating much more than a pint of Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked and a coke...so I wasn’t putting much in. Still not so happy I have to eat and shit, just wish I could do away with those! You’re giving me flashbacks to 2005 bro chill. I read this sub to fall asleep. Without nightmares. It absolutely should be. Dang why didn't I think of that. ThanksYup Tia was my last and final relapse. Shot it for 6 months and I'm not joking, I literally have no veins left except my dick and femoral. My neck has hardened up and has a very serious abscess at a point. My forearms and kneews were wrecked. All for a high that loses the magic in 2 days. It's the insanity thinking it'll be "different the next shot I'll do more" and "I won't get injured I'm not like them" well both of those happened and quick. Avoid this drug as much as possibleI’ve not been near your 2 week record but after only like 5 days my shit was so hard and impossible to move. 

Had to reach in there and break parts off. Is that bad? It passed eventually though lolI've been on heroin for over 6 years now, and though I see these kind of complaints really often, I don't get why you put yourselves through it. When I'd not been on heroin for long and just picked up a habit and was in a situation where the H was practically unlimited, one time I ended up constipated for 2 weeks and then having really awful abdominal and bowel pain for a couple of hours until I finally had the biggest shit of my life. It was a traumatic experience and though I look back on it amused now, going through it was hell. Since then to avoid it I just make sure that every 2 or 3 days I hold off on my morning dose until I've taken a shit. Sure, I'd rather take a shot as soon as I wake up, but I only have to endure an hour or 2 of the mild beginning withdrawal symptoms before I can go to the bathroom and then I'm all good and can take my hit. It's a mild inconvenience but it's a damn sight better than writhing around in agony on the toilet trying to give birth out my ass at 3 in the morning. Why doesn't everyone do this??? anybody that takes opiates everyday or often should also be taking a stool softener everyday. since i started taking my zub i couldn’t go #1 or #2 for a week but now that i incorporate the softener i’ve not had a problem since [deleted]Tia is like shooting elmers glue. Its use/abuse is not sustainable whatsoever. Hats off to you for staying away from it. I never got hooked to it, just used it in desperate times. Its withdrawals are supposed to be rough arent they? I think I remember reading its got SSRI-like properties or something along those lines?When you were young and naive... but now you are... **THE POOPSHIPDESTROYER**This is just all too relatable...I closed my eyes and saw myself, frozen still with every muscle in my body tensed, sweat building at my hairline and feeling that first of many pain-sweats trickle down the side of my face, focusing all my strength on pushing out what I already know is damn impossible to do with injury...grabbing toilet paper and basically picking the rock out of my asshole....here’s to a better year and more Metamucil<3 Ween![deleted]I’m having vivid flashbacks. When I got done with detox and into rehab they gave me Miralax and I fucking loved it. I’d get so fucking hyped when I needed to shit. It was � as the kids say. lost in the sauce once again

&#x200B;This thread is fucking gold @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 21 years ago I quit heroin, Benzos, meth, and alcohol., Content: , ups: 1473, downs: 0I’m coming up on 2 years March 1. Happy anniversary! �Congrats, that’s amazing! You're awesome!! ���

Congrats and Happy Birthday!

Thank you for all you do ��Thanks for everything you’ve done for this community. You’re a legend whose legitimately saved lives. Much love!I've never used but as your flair says, you're the heroine of heroin.

Keep inspiring and helping people Tracey, you're amazing.21 years...wow! Congrats!!
I wish I could make it to 1 year....Thank you for everything you've done for this community Tracey.  You have pushed harm reduction, saved lives with Narcan, and I think most importantly helped HUMANIZED us "worthless addicts" to a larger populace.  

I, like thousands of people in this subreddit, appreciate the fuck out of you.  I've got 4 years heroin free and am considering getting a career change into addiction therapy - if I can help a percentage of the people you have I will consider my life a success. 

Congrats again, and much love!That's a really huge accomplishment!! Congratulations �Man, I can't imagine what that detox was like. My best friend hung him self while detoxing after a monstrous run on meth heroin and benzos in January. Thanks for spreading the word, showing us how it can he done.So, is an ice cream guaranteed with 21 years of sobriety?!?!

Lol!

Congratulations!! You are an inspiration and I am so proud of you!So, my standard question - do you find the clean life boring? 

A lot of people here seem to have this as a big concern.

You know, cause chasing dope is so much fun and all. 

Would be interested in your opinion. Super congratulations!Tracey! From The Dark End of The Street??Hell yeah, congratulations!!It’s crazy to me that you’re part of this sub with all of us and that I’m able to communicate with you, after seeing the Dark End of the Street in 8th grade lol congratulations on 21 years, happy for your sobrietyAmazing! Congratulations! XoWell done Tracey You quit when I was 2 years old, that's super awesome. Hoping I get there one day. Amazing Tracy you are a role model to so many of us.  I have two and a half years and I look to you for inspiration.  You’re killing it girl!I've been clean from coke and benzos and weed like.... Nearly a year. Still depressed but when I go to sleep I thank God I'm alive and soberYour story shows me that it is possible for anyone to get off this shit. Thank you for all you do from some stranger You're a real-life super hero! The real MVP.\m/Congratufuckinglations!!! That is no easy task a d that's a long stretch. Go do treat yo self!!!You Rock! Congrats �Legend! Wish I could kick benzos; I'm a week and a half off morphine using kratom but I've taken probably 50 xanax barsTracy youre fucking awesome I saw the doc you were in and what a turnaround youve made! Im 28 right now and struggling with staying clean from black which isnt good considering im on parole with a 4 year suspended prison sentence, so the stakes are so high... Too bad they dont know how fucking hard it is to come off this shit. I was on suboxone program 3 yrs ago and then got the vivitrol shot after i was released from jail last year and my countys(San Jose- Santa Clara county, CA)program is so fucked they said because i have gotten the vivitrol shot, thats now my ONLY option, and i cant switch to the sub or methadone program. So stupid. Either way youre still an inspiration and its awesome that youre from my area(as in the SF Bay AREA)Kudos to you amigo I know how that goes my go to combo is Adderall,benzos, and some sort of opiate. I drink alcohol with them if it’s around but letting anything have a hold on you isn’t worth it in the end but yet we still continue to do shit we know we shouldn’t.. glad you’re free from it I’d love to swap stories lol good luck to you and have a nice day �Just got 7 months myself! I remember seeing your story on a documentary, thanks for the inspiration. We do recover that's absolutely amazing, congrats : ) i'd love to give you gold but i'm poor, so here: �MMmmmmm heroin and ice cream.

Seriously though, great job, I watched the HBO doc. years ago, and have been following you for a while. Read your first post and AMA here. Even the Dopey podcast stuff! You do a lot of good in HR and alike. I'm glad that shit is in my past too. Life in color is so much better (no reference to the pictures intended).We met somewhere on here before. You are looking great!Tracy you are a champWooop wooop congrats and thanks for what you do!! ❤️Happy birthday. Thanks for your service. For anyone who doesn’t know, Tracey has a film/documentary about her life as a junkie. Good watch! That’s incredible keep it up��Congratulations! You are a miracle! Wow just wowCongratulations honestly huge accomplishment. Also everything you do for harm reduction is awesome. Youre an angel Tracey, God blessThat ice cream looks delicious!Congratulations!!Hell yeah, Tracey! I love your instagram and your commitment to harm reduction and education are truly inspiring.

You’re an inspiration to all of us!thanks for everything traci!You're an inspiration, Tracey. Really hope to follow in your path one day. Whenever I despair over quitting I'll remind myself that you detoxed without any fancy support by yourself and how you're the living, breathing proof that longterm recovery is possible. Thanks for spreading all that positivity and congratulations on 21 years of doing the nigh impossible! �❤️Very grateful to share this earth with you. Congrats on the achievement and thanks for everything you do. ❤️What’s your opinion on using cannabis to quit? Can you still be “clean” if you smoke weed?Can u link the documentary you are in? I can't find itYour sobriety is now of drinking age, better watch out! Kidding, congrats, I can't even imagine what my life may look like in 5 years, let alone 21? Yeesh.No way!!! WE HAVE THE SAME CLEAN DATE! Today I'm celebrating 1 year!Ahh, sticking to barbiturates. I like your style!Congratulations! I know you've been on tv before, but did you happen to be in a documentary around the time the picture on the left was taken? I watched one on youtube awhile ago and the image on the left looks like a person that was on it. Just wondering!That’s beyond awesome!! How did you do detox? I’m in a similar boat to you 21 years ago, and I need and want off!  I just can’t seem to do it.. congrats again, and dm me if you have the opportunity, I’m looking for anything to get me to the better side.. Thank you!Girl you should be in charge of your cities harm reduction.  Ive never come across anyone more dedicated at helping people, really helping people with no hidden agenda to inflate your ego or self worth. I'm half way round the world from you and am involved in harm reduction in my city by being a therapist for teen addicts, and almost everyone on the team knows about your story.

Just want to let you know you're being a worldwide inspiration.  Keep it up.Congrats Mama! Thank you for all of your dedication and hard work...you are a the best! you look exactly like the chick from the black tat heroin documentary unless you are her...Awesome. Loved the book and your interview on the dopey podcast. Congrats. [deleted]Congrats!!!you look soooo good!  looking forward to your book, keep us posted Wow. Big props to you! I’ve very proud of you. Your an icon for all of us that are clean or trying to get clean. Thank you so much for your post I've seen the doc you were in on YouTube- it was moving. Thank you for sharing your hope - recovering heroin & crack addict- 5.5 yrs clean. Congrats girl[deleted]You’re amazing!!!Wow so amazing! Congrats! Be proud!Congratulations! 37 days. I’m bored.Holy shit! Congratulations. I remember seeing you in an opiate documentary a few years back, and was so sad to hear that you had continued to use after the doc ended. Your story was really impactful to me at the time. I hope you are doing well. Much love ❤️ Way to go!Tracy, you are killing it! Thank you for all that you are/do! Xx.You in the rooms?? You know, the rooms where one says "clean" rather than "sober"?? 

Would love to meet you. Shoot me a message if you're ever in the central valley to chair a meeting =] 

I know I can watch a documentary about you, but there's nothing like hearing such a powerful message right from the addict's mouth. 

I remember you from that HBO doc. That's amazing !  Keep on Keeping on!Badass! Good on ya, broCongrats Thanks for all you do!Fuck yeah Tracey. You give us all hope.you are fucking awesomeStr8 off the set of MomThank you Tracy :)[deleted]Your a legend Tracy, congrats from AustraliaMaking a life-changing decision requires enormous amount of strength and braveness. You must be one proud lady.  
By the way, bon appétit with this charmingly delicious looking ice cream!Congratulations!!! ���Amazing!!METH?  3% success rate.  Do you still get cravings?Congratulations that’s amazing!!Omg I hope you’re super proud of yourself, you should be ! It’s good to see people do it :) Congratulations Tracey, it is a huge accomplishment!! Thank you for all you do for our community, you truly are a lifesaver !! I’ve done that method, and it did work, I also stayed clean for a few years after, my situation is going on 6 months now, the last two being a continuous “I’m not going to touch that shit again” and the longest I’ve gone is close to 48hours... 

Anyway, congrats on having a life, and keeping that shit out of yours! I hope I’ve shot my last shot, I was planning on it this week, I made it until today, and the vomiting and physical weakness decided it was going to let me mindfuck myself into using today so I can take care of my responsibilities. 

My apologies to the community that could have done without my “poor me” I can’t quit shit.. I know this post is about the strong woman, who hasn’t picked back up, like my dumbass..You truly are an inspiration and a saint for all you do. EDIT- you also look GREAT!I'm sorry for your loss.  Ow is addicted to ice cream and Reddit. Better than H and meth tho! Good jobThanks to you answering my messages I obtained the narcan that ultimately saved my life and I am heading to rehab for the first and hopefully only time in the next week. Thanks for all that you do![deleted]Congrats homie!! ���An amazing feat, for an amazing woman!! Congratulations Tracy!!! ❤️Congrats!!Dark end of the streetSo fucking amazing Tracey! I am so happy for you. Thank you for all you have done for the members here, and addicts in general. Your story really is an inspiration! I knew as soon as I read that headline it was you!!!!
Congratu-fucking-lations�❤️���⭐��️��️✔️I have followed your story for a while, since I first saw the doc,  and then opiophila, and on to reddit. 21 years is incredible. Takes a ton of strength. Congrats and wish you all the best moving forward I remember you from the BTH documentary, glad to see you're still around :)I read your book in prison just a great memoir thank you so much!TRACEY what a fuckin success story you are. I love everything you do for this community. You are seriously the best kind of recovered addict. I hope you continue to inspire and touch people's lives, and get more people well. 

Thanks to you, and reading your story, I decided it was time to do Suboxone maintenance. I'm proud to say I've been on suboxone for over 4 years now, and my taper will end soon (down to 1mg a day!). I continue to look to you as a source of inspiration. 

Thank you, Tracey. On behalf of the community.I'm 21 and you're an example since I discovered that you're alive after the documentary. Hope you're feeling well and thanks for your help in the community.WOO HOO ��‍♀️��
You rock!!!!Mad respect Lucky DUCK.......PRAY FORM__Congratulations!! That's almost my whole life, but again congrats, it's really an achievement!  You really spread some hope in the world. I hope someday to be able to get my hands on your "The Big Fix: Hope After Heroin".. Here in Italy I really struggled some time ago to find it, thinking now about buying it in english on Amazon... This is what I and other addicts in recovery wish and strive for. Congratulations to the max This brought me a lot of joy. Dark end of the street is a favorite of mine, seen it so many times. Its just too real, so happy you got your life back when you did.Wow! I have been sober for almost 3 years now, but this is motivation and proof it is possible to change your destiny! :) Thank you for sharing!Congratulations Tracy. You have been a great inspiration to me and my wife. We now have 16 Months clean time after 15 years of heavy use. Without people like you and our maintenance program we never would be where we are today.  We are finally getting custody of our 4 year old daughter and have our own apartment and the trust and support of our family again. Huge congratulations are due. And huge thanks too, for everything you do for harm reduction online and offline. Amazing willpower! Great work, ma'am! Because of you, I ate a pint of Haagen-Dazs mint chip ice cream last night.

I mean, there's some addictions you just don't get over.i make a point to carry spare fresh rigs and narcan, but im not sure what else i can do. Any tips?Ur truly an inspiration to us all. I totally recall seeing you in the HBO doc. Come such a long way congratulations!!! I have been working on it myself but I seem to get 6 months an then break back to bad habbits. Hopefully I'll get it right one day sooner then laterCongrats traceyh. And hi from a follower on twitter :)Congrats!! ���  and to many more years! Were you in a documentary about addiction? 

Edit: never mind. Should have read the thread before postingI remember seeing you in that BTH documentary before seeing you on here. Kind of surreal.[deleted][deleted]Thanks. That’s rad!THAnk you � Thank you ❤️❤️❤️Wait who dis? He the one who send out narcan? Thank you A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

Thank you Thank you !!!I was ❤️Here I am :)Cause she loves usI do harm Reduction services here and since I’ve been doing OD Prevention for 20 years, opioids don’t bother me. I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week Harm reduction.why not?To give advice and share the experience of overcoming addiction? Maybe?
Idk if you are genuinely worried that this may be a trigger for hrr, or just being a jerk.Do some research on her. She's pretty much a harm reduction legend, on and offline. The name is Tracey Mitchell Helton (hope I didn't misremember sth here) and she's mainly known for her appearance in the HBO documentary black tar heroin the dark end of the street in the 90s and has written books on the subject. Can only recommend the documentary, I've seen it more times than I can count. One of the best drug documentaries out there. ;) Why not?Shes an inspiration and it motivates people. If you've seen the documentary back in the day you'd know if she can do it any of us can do it.I've been clean for 16 months. I like to come here because this is where people need the most help and support.Dumbest question of the month award.It's a she, but yeah, she did that amongst other things. Shh!Bad botBad bot. This bot is dumb as hellTy Tracie. Drug policies should be legislated with people like you, and fuck off the pharma lobbies, but money, I know.
Thank you again.What clicked the last time? I sort of know myself and know I’ll always want to chip and think I can without getting a habitTy internet stranger.
 In this sub I find more support and compassion than IRL.
Your words had really made my day. 
Thank you so much.Gosh i hope youre right, im coming up on 3 years and i still struggle with cravings pretty regularly... I was clean for a year and 3 months off benzos and heavy heroin use, do you think my brain will reset back to noraml, because as the time went on iT was getting worse and after year i thought things would be good again. I ended up getting back on my medication for my My depression an anxiety. IF you dont mind me asking, do you take any medications? Crazy to be talking to you! Probably in my top films of all timeAwesome! Seriously shit aint easy. I beat opiates and alcohol and now coming off benzos. I can only imagine all four for that long. Not many can do it and it is no small victory for anyone, it is huge! Have fun !!!!Yeah I've seized off them before sadly because I was a dumbass lol; I'm prescribed them now thankfully but the xanax here is all still pressed pills so I gotta quit when I can before I get fent. 

Thanks for the response, you're a real lifesaver and this community is blessed by someone offering harm reduction, gives me motivation to stay off opiates seeing what you've done! 

Also, I live in an area with needles/cookers/cotton all available at the pharmacy no questions asked so if you ever run out of supplies or something for the kits I've seen you send out feel free to message me and I'll do what I can to help; just wanted to throw that out there.Yea i know... All because this dude didnt wanna have to go do a little time for a possession charge and be dopesick so instead he sets me up, house gets raided by swat and i get caught up with 7 oz of coke half oz of heroin lsd mdma and 40 plants.It’s on YouTube. I forget the name but if I remember right it’s filmed in San Francisco. Sorry I haven’t seen it in a few years Haha thanks, I will, but it's all the more reason to pull through given it's possible to do it cold turkey. ;D tho usually I relapsed in less than 48hrs, despite meds and even ibogaine once lmao. 



Anyways, happy celebrations if you celebrate this day! :3Thank you �Word, thank u. And yeah, 90 days on March 5th, suboxone and low dose klonopin only.Were ludes really all they are made out to be it is that just nostalgia?You look fabulous btw. what was it lik3 banging dope back in the day. im sure it was alot harder to score without cellphones lol. and you know where any of the other in the documentary are . dead alive or still using. clean?!?!? thanks ispiring story. was a good watch :)Whoa I was talking about your older interview. That’s so crazy that your tonight’s guest too. I’m listening now. That’s soooooo crazy lol. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dopey-dark-comedy-drug-addiction-heroin-cocaine-meth/id1077823917?mt=2&i=1000418919114
That’s amazing. Hopefully you’ll inspire someone to get clean. Keep up the good work Hey, I checked out the documentary. I started hanging out in SF shooting dope in 1998. I posted a link in the private sub to an article w an interview w my running buddy out there. 

21 years is fucking great. I had 13 years and fucked up, but I'm back on the suboxone now. Anyways, congrats again, keep on rocking in the free world!Thank you , after many of nights spent shivering in a hot bath barley holding my head above water and shitting and puking my soul out I'm a hell of a lot better , first time sober in almost 15 yearsThere’s other things?Lol to be fair I was stoned when I watched it. Regardless, glad you’re doing well:)[deleted]I cant believe you take the time to reply to everyone!! i saw you the "Black tar heroin: dark end of the street" many years ago when i was in the peak of my substance use; I really identified with you.

I really wanna say its amazing how you've not only turned yourself around, but have given so much back to those of us still afflicted. Your an inspiration; i hope to give back myself when i get clean (and i will one day)Understood... I was totally kidding if that didn't come through on my previous comment �Same mamaYou are so welcome dear. You really truly deserve it. You do so many amazing things for other people. I always find it hard to describe how I truly feel when I am overly passionate about something and I am very passionate about how I feel about your work.
Whew.... I wish that was the case for me. My mom bought it off amazon and mailed it in but nonetheless. Great read. I love your view on people staying off dope via suboxone. It really hit home and I couldn't agree more. Thanks for everything Tracey!See, that’s all I was asking, thank you. I hope I didn’t come off as rude, as everyone else took it. 
>I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week 

Wow only 5 days a week? Are the junkies in s.f taking weekends off now? Very progressive! 

/s orry couldn't help myself....[deleted][deleted]Oh shit my bad I’m sorry Sometimes it actually corrects someone who misspelled it... But for real. Why do we have a bot for a misspelling or a typo?They don’t even let me in the room :( I was just worn out and planning to die so it was easy to try new things 3-4 years the cravings died off for me Hey, good job!! Don’t know if you still need but the best way to go is naturally and just get some type of craft. Or try smoking CBD it really saved me when I was going insane with coke Mine too strangely enough I’m glad Harm Reduction is widely available there Thanks. I think I found it. Sure. Congrats :) I only took 1/2 and I’ve nevef been fucked up like that �������Google my blog “black tar heroin:10 questions answered”. No cell phones- just pagers. And the dope wasn’t as strong Congrats to you Wow how does it feel Allegedly I was high when I made it Oh no I love compliments- no sarcasm there. After you get to be 40, the validation dries up �You can give back now. Don’t let drug use stand in the way of your dreams. There are plenty of ways we can all contribute ���Tracey's a staple of this sub. If you havent already, watch that old HBO doc called Black Tar heroin, its in SF in I think the late 90s if you wanna see where she's coming from. Like in a very intimate way, almost to the point that I feel weird recommending it. But I think it's many of our favorite doc about junkie living.She had saved so many lives here by sending Narcan. Truly a blessing she is here. I once sent her a message in a dark time, I believe I asked something along the lines is recovery truly possible? She sent back something inspiring! I’m almost 2 years clean now. Life is lovely. I still hang around to remember how things used to be and sometimes chime in with info. I’m sorry you got downvoted so much. I don’t leave the house on the weekends- depression naps...I've been clean for like 4 years or so ( besides taking something like once or twice a year) and I just like looking sometimes.

Or maybe there is people in comment sections or posts that are looking for advice or help and she is trying to help in any way she can given her experiencesI get what you are saying. I used to come for the company, but ultimately it is what forced me to take a good look at myself. I come back to see how everyone is doing, and remind myself why I quit. Because being in active addiction is not a requirement for participating here. Anyone with honest curiosity, recovering addicts, relatives of someone in the struggle is welcome. We share our experiences, our victories and defeats, our happy moments, and our grief.There are a lot (A LOT) of people here who either don't use anymore or never have. I think the downvotes are just because that's common knowledge here. Even though, you have done so much!I bet....keep up the good fight. You have saved so many lives....including this one. You are an inspiration and the reason I found Reddit and this sub. That’s funny congrats! Do you have an interview or AMA talking about your experience with those times and the film? I feel like I heard about something like that. tha k u tracey . any complications from iv dope by the wayLol thanks. 90 days is pretty pathetic compared w the 13 YEARS I had, but I'm trying not to beat myself up. My midlife crisis kinda knocked me for a loop...[deleted][deleted]I'm old enough in this sub when i remember her showing up. We shot the shit in the old IRC back when i was active and living in boston all strung out. Sent her collarbone pics hah. She's a saint of the damned and has touched so many fucking lives. She knows more about my shit than most friends and all my family.There’s a few on Reddit somewhere She has a blogyou didnt answer the questions about the others status but thats okay. have a good 1 traceyI’ve had 34 abscesses and I had Hepc but im cured now My mid life crisis involved crippling depression Absolutely. My crotch was on fire the first few months I’ve only gotten better with age Was it because back then you didnt know the dangers of reusing dirty needles and not wiping alcohol and overall just goos hygeine when shooting (for the abcesses) and for the hep C was that because everyone was unaware that sharing needles passed on hep c and other diseases? thank you for answering allcmy questions. sorry im so curious ofnwhat it was like to live back then bring a junkie like myselfNo one knew about Hep C then. It wasn’t even called hep C. It was non A non B crazy did you guys know about endo and blood infections. you guys probaly necwr wiped with alcohol and practice safr injection. u guys were savagesWe did but the main thing we were worried about was HIV because there were no meds at the time  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: lol, Content: , ups: 1267, downs: 0Hmm surely they wouldn't cut my £0.30 Xanax pills with a dangerous drug...[deleted]Not the worst meme OP. Plot twist, Xans weren't laced, still died due to mixing Opi's and Benzo'sLmao will that really save u if the nanny is cut with fentyHahahahahahahahahahahaaaaummmm.....of course....xan + sub = full respiratory depression...Bupe can't block fent.  lolLol this should be on r/drugscirclejerkfuuuckAfter my last surgery they had to give me fent where I’d been on sub but I could be wrong Accept there is something called binding affinity and compounds with a higher binding affinity can dislodge others. Sub has a higher binding affinity than naloxone so it dislodges it making it useless. Fentanyl, has one of the highest binding affinities of any opioid and dislodges bupe and naloxone. To a degree an extreme amount of naloxone can offset this but in reality if there is any significant dose of fentanyl present you will need a compound called methylnaltrexone...

Psst and you dumbasses think you’re a scientist? 

Btw the term would be pharmacologist 

Either way you’re not it It's a sad fuckin' situation that people have to worry about black-market benzo's are cut with fent!!!  Sad but true.This had me rolling ����Wish i could get subs, but if i went to a doc for it my neuro would for sure cut my script for epilepsy and then the fuck if id be able to drive. And after that is one buttery ass slippery slope.If it’s strong enough, it’ll overpower the buprenorphine. Be careful with fentanyl. Perfect pic to go wit itI remember when I got off fentanyl/fent analogue I had to take 16 mg of subs to relieve the dope sickness and even then, I was just functionable, not high. However, more recently I got off BTH and I took 4mg of suboxone and definitely was a bit high, was a pleasant suprise. Now I am taking 1-2mg a day and while I don't get a traditional "opiate high" i get a definite mood boast and energetic which I enjoy. Never saw black market benzos, they are otc here...do even xans get cut with fent these days? that a thing?Is this why I’m seeing a decrease in demand for xannies on the street? People are really worried about product being cut with fent. Or is the hype surrounding Lil Xan blowing it out of proportion?The accuracy �Back to formulaBupe can help reverse an opiate overdose, but bupe in your system or not, if 5mg of fent Could kill you, and you ingest 5mg of fent, you're out for the count. You're still adding opiates on top of opiatesXanax pills cut? Isn't that like the benefit of pills, it's sort of easy to tell if it's been fucked with? Are these people crushing the bills, cutting shit in, and then repressing them? Wtf?

Man people downvote you hard for not knowing Xanax facts[deleted]Yes especially since the science doesn’t make perfect sense. Like ya there’s less per receptor activity, and less overall, but if there’s nothin in the xan...you’ve just taken opis for no reason. Subs are opis obviously even if they’re weak. If they want an antagonist, go get naloxone there’s a plethora. 

That’d be more “pure” for this purpose. 
And more effective. Tho bupe does have higher binding affinity than fent so thatd help a bit but I don’t think that the person who made the meme considered all variables and neuro pharmacological effects. 
So much on here is like, really da!!!!Sadly the only comment that mention the dangers of mixing Xanax and bupe.“the nanny” lol It can't? Really? Link, please.  Not challenging you. Just curious.  Thanks.??? It can. It has a higher binding affinity. It won’t block entirely but it would help. The only issue is few molecules of drug need to bind for a high level of affect in fents case. But it would help. Naloxone would be more effective but also bupe has higher binding affinity than fent while naloxone has equivalent binding affinity roughly speaking. 

- have actually used bupe to reverse a fent overdose more than once but I theoretically knew it would work or I wouldn’t have tried it... on myself first back in the day, then others. 

when I first learned about this in neuroscience and pharmacology classes I thought it might work but it took me a few years to prove because people don’t overdose in front of me all that often, from fent specifically. Got my chance tho. I always thought this info should be dispersed as harm reduction . I believe fent is 1 of 3 drugs w a higher binding affinity to the mu receptor....oxymorphone being anotherYes it can..Yeah it unfortunately has become a thing and a legitimate concern when sourcing black market pharmaceutical benzos. It is crazy but yes  people are insanely pressing whats marketed aa 2mg   xanax bars that in actuality contain fent not if you have enough narcan. i od'd on 3 mg of fentanyl hcl and was not on suboxone at the time, with pressed roxy pills and needed 2 doses of narcan nasal to life.A large percentage of street Xanax is pressed even if fent isn't in it, a plethora of other things could be. My friend died from coke cut with fent


I thought like u thinking before that. Now I just have a head scratcher 

They shouldn’t be but I guess some people are fucking stupid Lil Peep died from a fent pressed Xan. It makes sense, the bupe blocks the fent.


I would've died every time I was banging straight fent if it weren't for all the bupe still in my system.They aren’t really weak, they just aren’t as euphoric. An 8mg sub would floor someone who doesn’t ever take opiates, IMO. They’d be having a bad time. 

But also fent will push through subs, so this meme doesn’t make sense. Why would a Xanax have fentanyl in it?[deleted]That's what Casey Anthony referred to Xanax as. Xanny the Nanny. Gave that shit to her kid so she could party instead of parent.I think he meant that fent will almost always break thru the bupeYeah I’ve never used bup to treat OD. But I have used suboxone (1-3mg) in the morning then went and got high. I did the same amount of not more than my friend who had a large habit (gram-ish/day). He OD’d and I didn’t. I got plenty high but was completely fine and not close to OD. My boy ended up ODing and needed 6mg of narc to comeback. After his urine test he found out the dope was mainly fent. At the time I had no dope habit at all just was on 1-3mg of sub a day.

I know it’s a different situation but still feel like this example holds some value to the topic. I’ve also heard similar stories of bup reversing OD from heroin (probably fent mixed). I wouldn’t recommend using suboxone to reverse an OD unless it’s life or death situation with no narcan or medical assistance available. What were you taking a pharmacology class for. I also got a degree in neuroscience but never needed to take pharmacology. It might of been an elective tho. Are you sure? I'm convinced that taking bupe after fent can reverse an OD/cause precipitated withdrawalsYeah. Dilaudid is one of the few opioids besides fent that binds more strongly than bupe. 

I was looking for a good source to provide for people but it was surprisingly hard to find.Look it up. Google or something.Weird. It's been a while but I only ever got bars and I feel like I'd know the difference. Shit I remember another reddit user said he got his bars he bought tested and they had some wack cannabinoid in them. You never know nowadays Wow I wonder why they would even cut coke with fent. Was it an accident? Was it like a laboratory making both chems and one got mixed in, a careless dealer moving both? More likely part B.

I’m unmoved personally. I think all drugs should be legal and take Xanax for diagnosed anxiety. If people are buying bars on the street uninformed as fuck, it’s their own fault when they get a bunch of crappy fake BS. When I buy on the street i know the risk and accept responsibility for any consequences I might endure as a result of my bad, fun choice. I have a friend who is now dead because he took three bars laced with fentanyl. Motherfucker was 24 years old. He was behaving like an idiot and lost his life. It makes me sad as fuck.

You guys got my comment all wrong. Playing with something that might have fent in it is like dicking around with a loaded gun, eventually something bad is going to happen. The idea that you’d be taking suboxone to counteract the effects of what might be in your fake pills is fucking stupid. I am not saying it doesn’t suck when these people die, it’s a god damn tragedy. If we quit the war on drugs and legalized narcotics this wouldn’t be a problem. But they are stupid. Anyone behaving like this is behaving like a fucking stupid idiot and is rolling dice with their life on the crap table. Street drugs are Russian Roulette these days. 

I mean I know the meme was just for fun but it’s kind of a morbid topic for anyone whose life has been touched with death as a result of the specter of fentanyl. It’s today’s mystery monster that pops up everywhere randomly killing innocent stoners. All I can think is, why? And the only answer I can come to is that drugs are illegal. Would solve so many problems it’s literally mind boggling.Nooe, he had alprazolam and fent and pxy in his system so a fake oxy 30 with fent is like 1000% more likelyI remember reading somewhere that one of his friends (I think mackned) had an oxy 30 that looked fake but gave it to peep instead of taking it. The bars were most likely real, the 30 was probably pressed I lied my first time in rehab  and said I was an opiate addict even tho I wasn't dependent and had no tolerance. 4 mg of bupe twice a day for the first 3 days combined with phenobarbital for benzo w/d had me so high that I blacked out the whole weekend 

The nurses had to keep checking on me because I was perpetually nodding. Definitely wasn't having a bad time lolPer receptor site relative to street drugs in terms of activity they are weak. Dose is relevant. But yeah I mean depolarization  requires more receptors filled per neuron  ... bupe on its own is even weaker ... it’s metabolite norbuprenorphine is more active but it’s conversion rate is low and has a ceiling effect so 

to simplify; weak, yes

That doesn’t mean people don’t get high af. People get high off codeine ffs. And I know it’s morph that’s active in that case but again ; ceiling effect due to conversion necessity Fake 


Pressed pill made in black market 

Some are so accurate they’re impossible to differentiate I know. Isn't fentanyl more expensive? I remember on the DNMs you could get massive bags of real alprazolam or whatever it is and/or pressed pills. I always assumed it was much easier and cheaper to make and/or smuggle that shit.

I know fentanyl is pretty cheap esp. given its potency, but honestly it just seems stupid to me. I guess it's just to meet a demand when you have no supply but killing mofos isn't good for business either.

Like when someone cuts fentanyl into coke. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE SAME HIGH?!? So why not just give people 100% baby laxative if you're fucking them over anyways? It'll take you 30 seconds to realize it isn't coke. Why risk the manslaughter charge?I agree, I’m annoying. I wouldn’t want people to think it actually works like that, and I guess I just am at a point of exasperation with internet pharmacy advice. 

Bwahahahaha. Best random fact I've heard all week.Lol, never knew that. She lives in just a bit south of me. She is always front and center for Trump protests here in Palm Beach.Not true. Buprenorphine has the highest affinity of any opioid around. If you take a full blocking dose of 24 mg nothing will break through. That’s exactly what I meant thank you for specifying I should have done but it slipped my mind:
When no other means of reversal is around, subs will suffice especially in pt’s that are not opiate naive. Subutex works too but suboxone is preferable due to antagonist component. 


it makes perfect sense that this works the way it does in your story. Theoretically, bupe occupied receptors protecting them from Fent binding, 

even though bupe, and metabolite norbuprenorphine especially, is  active....bupe contributes less per occupied receptor site to opening of ion channels, thus changing the voltage of the cell less, thus causing less overall depolarization/firing of the neuron, 

Also since bupe has a higher binding affinity (level of “attraction” to receptor... think of it like the strength of a magnet for simplicity) than fent it takes priority at the receptor site and prevents the more powerful molecules from occupying as many sites as they would’ve (like in your ODd friend)

Your friend took so many mg of naloxone to bring back because 1- fent only needs a few receptor bound for a potent effect thus lots of antagonist needed to bounce the few off 2- naloxone actually has a pretty similar binding affinity to fent. Bupe actually has a higher affinity which is why it can work better than naloxone in for fent. 3- dose is relevant but not the only factor clearly 


 ... as I said, per occupied receptor site compared to commonly abused drugs (even more disparity with fentanyl) 

Anyway I studied neuroscience and psych and was a junkie for ten years so this =my shit. I used to love combining 7yr worth of study at university with my life experience from my habit because I’d come up with life saving info like this without having tried it out in the field. It saved my life first, so I’d say it was pretty damn helpful. That guy I ODd in front of, if I hadn’t told him what to do, woulda dragged me into the street by the ankles otherwise. Dealers don’t want dead chicks in their house. Bupe has a higher binding affinity than diamorphine, so it can be used as to reverse a H OD, but I think naloxone is still better to use as it's a true antagonistSo, fent, oxymorphone, And hydromorphone Bars are what's being pressed. It just depends on the presser and how professional they are. A lot of presses are shitty and you can tell something's off, it's crumbly, chalky, tastes weird, breaks easy, etc, indicating that it's been pressed. Where as some more professional pressers with better pill presses can make some practically flawless presses that you really can't tell they're pressed at all without sending to energy control or something and seeing a higher dose than 2. I can only imagine they put fent into super stepped on coke or to cause an opiate wd and get them always coming back for moreWell he always had oxy in his system though, and he was taking bars in the video he uploaded the night he died, plus pretty sure they confirmed it was the bars?^^Either way I really wish he was still here.Isn't it already dangerous as hell to mix the two to begin with? Not saying it's not possible but if he got high quality presses its hard to OD on those alone. I've taken probably hundreds and never once OD'dWell I’ve seen people who are opiate naive take 8mg of bupe and throw up for two days, so that’s what I mean by having a bad time. it could be as simple as someone weighing out alprazolam and fent on the same scale without cleaning it, incidental cross-contamination.Didn’t find it annoyingBut your explanation was wrong because your scenario you laid out was wrong.


The situation is a pressed bar which definitely has some benzo in it, most likely 2-4 mg of alprazolam, but possibly cut with fentanyl.

Taking bupe prior to using fent truly DOES reduce risk of overdose, while still allowing the benzos to do their work.


I know how bupe and fent works, it's all I did for months and months.[deleted]Lol I heard it on Last Podcast on the LeftRegular fentanyl has a binding affinity to the u-opioid receptors of 0.39nM, bupe has a range of 0.21nM to 1.5nM. Fent can still bind even with suboxone in the system. Not even mentioning the fent analogues like 3-Methylfentanyl or carfentanil that can easily stay bound to receptors even with large doses of naloxone. Reply to your comment with Not True LOL. Fentanyl will break through with the right dose and it doesnt have to be ridiculously high eitherTell that to the me from 2 years ago who was breaking through his subs with fent-dope literally every other day lolYeah I don't think anybody I deal with is that sophisticated, although I suppose the guy above them could be. Never confirmed, and its enough that one of the oxies he takes is fake and hes gone. Its very ignorant to say the bars had the fentanyl, when clearly he was taking bars that contain real alp aswell. The most likely culprit has to be the oxy in that situationAs long as its all pharms and you know your limits, mixing benzos with opie is ay okay. I have mixed benzps, opies, gabapentin, ghb and alcohol recently on a night out and was fine because i know my tolerance and limits50/50 I guessMakes kinda sense though I don’t know what they say. Not if the buprenorphine is at a full blocking dose. The other guy posted affinity numbers but the only place I could find them was on Wikipedia, no academic sources. I was told by someone who works in the field that nothing can break through buprenorphine except for uncommon opioids like lofentanil and 3methylfentanyl as the guy said. Those are not really around at all save 3methyl in some eastern European countries. Estonia I believe. I feel like most Xanax is pressed now. I used to get a thousand bars at a time that were almost identical to pharma. I almost never come across real bars there more expensive and weaker than presses It’s everywhere.

I know because I've done it with fentanyl, as have other people on the internet.Nigga, i was prescribed 43.7mg (4 of the highest formulation Zubsolv)  of sub a DAY ... out of 155 patients i had the 3rd highest dose prescribed, and the top dude died after 3months so i graduated to the 2nd highest prescribed patient on a dose of suboxone in illinois... (so my doctor said, anyway.. i find that hard to believe personally, but then again 44mgs is retardedly unheard of and unnecessary) 

And guess what?
I still blasted right thru that shit with good ol’ street dergz ��Doesnt mean it is waaaaaayyyy mire likeky to be the fake oxy. If fent bars were really that big of a thing opioid addicts like me would fucking search for them for the sake of the fent. Atleast i would :DHaven’t heard that one either. Oh well. It’s just common sense that self reflection awareness and acceptance =beneficial I'm willing to bet you weren't on 24+mg of buprenorphine. At that level all the receptors are saturated and it's not possible. Until I see real evidence to the contrary I'm not going to change my belief on that. If you have anything academic that confirms what you're saying it would be interesting to me. I call bullshit. The ceiling dose is reached before 32 mg. No doctor who had any idea what he was doing would prescribe that much. But honestly, I really don't care. It's only impossible in theory, in practice you might not be absorbing as much bupe or your metabolism gets rid of the one and makes the other come out idk. In real life there's way more factors than a in vitro test. But technically you shouldn't be able to break through on a ceiling dose of bupe. I mean it’s usually a really small amount of Fent in them not enough to be economical for serious junkies but enough to fuck someone up who looking for xans, and if he was used to oxy, cuz I never heard him doing h, and he took a bunch of them like in the video, it could totally kill him. But yes fent is much much more common in presses opi pills.I think u/DonRobeo is going for the phrase "The first step towards getting better is admitting you actually have a problem."

I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it but for some reason I can't remember the exact wording either.was on 24 mg for 4 months. dont believe it if you want and i dont feel like looking up any studies if there are any im just telling you my experience. respect your opinion still though. chemicals compete for the receptors and the dose combined with the affinity the drug has for the receptor chooses which wins.I'm not sure one way or the other which of you is right - on the one hand, 24mg is a huge dose and it's easily believable that not even fent can break through it, but on the other hand people's responses and metabolism and biology are all different, and I've personally experienced breaking through 8mg just with heroin and not even with a large amount. Sure, I didn't get the full effects of the H, but I definitely have managed to get high a few hours after taking 8mg of subs, so I could also believe that with enough fent you could break through any dose of subs.

So I'm not sure who's right, but I just wanted to point out that it's not fair that you are holding /u/1inchslanger to a higher standard of proof then you are yourself providing for your argument. You are telling him that he has to link to and cite academic sources for his claim whilst your sources for your argument is "someone who works in the field". Dr. P******n, Champaigne, il - was narrowly defeated by like 50 votes when he ran for mayor (dudes got juice) - hes got an original bottle of OTC heroin from 1911 chillin in his office... he  also knew my uncle on a personal basis and told me i was one of the worst, most unique cases of addiction he’s seen in 15+ yrs of addiction practice - he was also the first dr in illinois to prescribe suboxone. And one of the first to prescribe methadone in a Maintenance capacity.

If you think im one of these little fuckin kids who thinks addiction is cool that goes around lying about shit to sound cool on this thread? Then I shouldn’t even be wasting my breath on you ; you’re of your depth, homeboy.

I try to remain humble, but i am the LAST person who would ever lie about my drug experiences - i have way too much respect for the chemical and the world that we all fell into to spread bullshit.

He used to basicaly admit to me that he had no intention of ever getting people off subs - there were people that had been coming for 7years that had never even gone down on a dose.

If you dont believe me, thats on you brother.And i hate to break it to you? But the majority addiction specialists don’t have the first clue as to what the fuck they do/prescribe.

I feel like he lowkey knew that i was hoarding these fuckin things - i would skip every other appt. basically letting him know “i dont nees subs this week, i’ll be back when its convenient for me”

I ws getting prescribed two BOXES of the generic every time i picked up my shit from the pharmacyUmm if there is enoguh fent in fake bars to get a noticeable effect even for non opi users there is CERTAINLY enough in it to make it economical for junkies. Trust me, atleast where i live in it would be much cheaper then buyng oxys etc and heroin is non existent here, if fent bars were commonly a thing every fucking junkie would be doing em here. Source: am a junkieits all subjective like you said everyone has a different experience. it could be that i need a higher dose to completely saturate my receptors. it could be that fentanyl is unique as an opioid (it is) and simply has strong enough affinity to displace buprenorphine depending on the dose. 

im currently tapering off and i was put under just recently with fentanyl and propofol to have my wisdom teeth removed, at a dose of 4 mg twice a week  skipping all the days inbetween but that proves nothing. i wish i was on 24 at the time of the surgery so i could have set in stone proof fentanyl can do such a thing at 24+ mgI wouldn't tell people the name of a doctor you've been to, that makes it very easy to identify you and can cause trouble for that doctor. Anyway, I believe you but I don't know why any doctor would ever do that, it's commonly accepted that past 32 mg all receptors are filled and any more bupe is just pissing out money. Read any prescribing guideline. Some docs still do it because they get money from the pharmaceutical company to bill the insuranceIt’s almost like addiction is a disease that they can only help you so much with� but yes let’s blame those idiot doctors because you made foolish decisions in your life which led to you being an addict. Fuck those doctors and opioid specialists amirite @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Ran into my old dealer yesterday, Content: This dude would front and front and front and front me, I'd always pay. He had good H and things went like this for a while until he ran out at some point.  This is five years and some months ago now, he hit me up, I'm dope sick as can be and he says, "want to go for a ride (to base)?  Hook it up". Yes!
He scoops me up, we drive the 40 minutes or so away and get to dude's house, he's got the H drawn up. I've never done it or seen it like that before  but I'm sick so tell him to hit me.
Literally I remember telling him I am totally fine, I want one more shot before we go and that's the last memory I have before waking up in the hospital.
Where we were is an old abandoned town where an airport use to be, literally just drug dealers live out there now and a good 30 minutes from a hospital. Dude could have just left me out there, thrown me down some abandoned street.
He took me to the hospital and when I woke up he was still there, he brought me home.
Well, five years later now I'm at a gas station with my almost two year old and I run into him. He has a two and a half year old, he's sober too, just bought a house. It's a really good feeling that we both made it but I'm telling you, dude has always been good to me and I'll never know why but it was kick ass to see him again!  Felt like it deserved a post, it's a pretty significant moment to me.
That's all guys 👌, ups: 1209, downs: 0Well this is just an all around, feel good story with a sense of warmth that has no business on this subreddit. You can either delete this post or quickly edit in you smoked H in his car in front of your kids and then stole his iPhone, at the vert least. Your choice.

seriously though good work, my ex-coke dealer just got out of jail and I avoid him like the fucking plagueHell yeah brother I have an oxy dealer that is exactly like that. He would front me hundreds of them because he knew I would pay up. Really cool fucking guy he is. Sadly he went away and I havent seen him in a few months. Once you build trust and buy alot really good dealers treat you pretty much like family. He would always call me his brother haha.Is your dealer the real life Junkie Jesus?and people say no good comes from h... We are all people. Thanks for writing this. A lot of people here need to see it. YEAH WELL MY DEALER WONT EVEN ANSWER HIS PHONE...  SO YEA.

Some guys get all the fuckin luck.[deleted]Great story! Thanks for brightening my day OPI’m gonna assume you’re a woman. If you were a dude he would pushed you out and said fuck off.lol this is heartwarming shitThat's as wholesome as r/opis can get! Thanks for sharing, this made me genuinely smile and hopeful that I'll cruise around with some future kids, too, sometime in the future. Nice dude! Maybe keep in touch with him if he has his affairs in order![deleted]Honestly thought it was gonna be a story about you getting jumped by your old dealer but no, it’s this beautiful fucking wholesome story. It makes me feel warm just reading it <3I love this story.It’s great to hear there are good people in the world especially when people think drug addicts are bad people That’s pretty badass !![deleted]❤️!! Lots of positivity your way Good story.  Surprisingly good ending for a story on this sub.  But sometimes I think people look at their time of addiction as a bad time.  Although it wasn't always a good thing, I look at it as a great learning experience.  I don't miss the wds, but I miss some of the enjoyable times I had during that period of my life.  Glad to hear yours had a good ending too, for you as well as him.So sweet LOL totally get it. I did overdose, get Narcan'd in the hospital, woke up so pissed off and stupid I ripped my IV's out of both of my arms and left the hospital though. So there's that.  Dealer went to jail for about a year for some meth bullshit and that was the last I heard of him until yesterday. I always use to jam my Korn CD when I'd run to his place and every time I hear those Korn songs I think about those times. My nostalgia lol.  Story still belongs here man, I relate to posts here"Avoid him like the fucking plague" You mean pick him up from jail hoping he'll knock some off you price for a 8 ball?You a funny guy Are we so depraved and absolutely devoid of feel\-goods?

I mean, I know I am...Feels like family too when you're living the life, heySomething to think about! Shit it might be him, he’s risen again after leaving the tomb from the opium farms in China. Piss on them hey. I am who I am because of my past with hThe first buddy I lost to drugs overdosed and was thrown out of the vehicle, had a stroke in a snowbank, life support for a few days and it took him out.  We are all people, true, but that could have easily been my story. Lots of thanks to my dealer���� lolOh I agree with you about straight edgers being fake. Some of the most shallow relationships I've ever experienced. I'm one year off of Subutex too, good job man and keep it up!   My active addiction I've felt things, (feelings, highs) stronger and more intense than I'll ever feel them again, it's a very important part of my life, good and bad. Love this subThanks man, thanks for reading!Yup Yup, right away. We caught up a little but, for five, ten minutes in line at the slowest gas station around.  Was real niceExactly what I've always thought. I've always thought well of him. The type of person you wish you would see again, in a better place in life. And thanks man, me too. So glad. I had a buddy who overdosed and his "friends" didn't want to get in any shit so they threw him out of the vehicle NEAR the hospital. He had a stroke outside in a snow bank and was on life support for a couple days, ultimately he didn't make it.  They were shooting speed freak and Suboxone, dirty drugs but that could have easily been me, thrown out of the vehicle.  Shit makes you wonder a lot and is why I proudly own where I've been in life. Lots of thanks owed to my old dealer though for sureThank you!  Same to you!I miss some of it too, a lot of it and definitely feel the same, it was a huge learning experience.  I remember one summer when I was living alone and it was beautiful outside and all I could do was shower and lay on the floor and feel bad that I couldn't bring my dog swimming or outside at all. I could hear the fireworks going off on the 4th of July, my family would come over to check on me and I was just a mess. That was the worst summer of my life, total waste and miserable.  Sends chills down my back. Addiction is such an intense thing. I'm glad your story had a good outcome too, my friend. Makes you appreciate a happy, peaceful life >hear those Korn songs

Only the albums up until Issues, I hope Yess Korn rocksWhat do you mean I'm a funny guy? Like I'm a clown? I'm here to amuse you? It really does and he really treated me like family and no matter how much I owed he always gave me more and never ever let me go to work sick or  be sick ever. He always delivered to me no matter where or what time it was too. One of the few good dealers around.I volunteer at a needle exchange, and used an overdose kit on a woman turning blue in our parking lot. It was my first time having to do that (opiates aren't my personal demons, but loved ones struggle) and it was terrifying. She was so mad at me! I know why, but getting yelled at sucks and I was already nervous and scared. 

Now anytime I see anyone being too still in their car in parking lots I check on them. Most of the time it is just tired employees, but I always think about that woman. Yes I agree. What I was getting at more was we are all people as in we all have the capacity to care and all the like, negative and positive.  I'm glad you are still here and able to share these stories with the community. :) now watch yiu r children have school together.  Haha you could both arrange the Halloween party and share old tales of runs past. 
That's real fucked up man.  There is no reason to do this.  I mean I understand you can catch a charge still in some states but I'd like to think I'd take that to save a life.For sure!   Really not into the Skrillex Korn stuff. Really like Brian Welch and listened to some of his other stuff, it's not bad at allEach Korn album (up to and including Issues) is amazingFinally. You got it. Username checks out....hey tommy!My last oxy dealer WAS my family and they fucked me out $250. Fuck you uncle tom and your lying ass daughter, though I am clean now thanks to that whole fiasco.my bf goes to work with me sometimes, especially if we don't round up money to score til last minute and he'll just chill in the car. i had to make him start parking in the back of the lot because people forever thought he was overdosed when he fell asleep (i work nights so he is often sleeping). irritating at times, but i'm glad so many people care enough to say something. God bless you for being there!Thanks man!   Lol about the kids, our luck they'll date!  Catch a charge for what?But that's when they were mainstream, so you're not very cool if you had no idea they existed before that.Well you lost $250 but you found out your uncle and cousin were scumbags and got clean! Not too bad of a trade off, at least in my eyes. Congrats dude!Wow thats fucked up.Taking an OD'd person to a hospital/authorities, I thinkI was like 10 years old when I got their self/titled album. made my parents buy it for meBack in my day, a guy stiffed me for a bill, and I was all angry, stomping around. My roommate said, "Look, you learned the content and quality of his character, and it only cost you $100. That's cheap." I had to pause, and admit he was right..
Anything with a parental warning label on it was a strict no-no in our household. Right up until I got to high school when I built a computer so I could get free music (dialup) and play counter strike 1.1 or 1.3, whichever the last version that allowed bunnyhopping. i saw them live a few times, first time i was in grade 6. that was a year after columbineI think 1.3 was the patch that took out bhopping. Ahh the good old days. Almost brings a tear to my eye.Or totem up and camp a corner.

Get someone high enough to glitch the map @@@@@@@@@@ Title: #NormalPeopleMatter, Content: , ups: 1171, downs: 0Heroin matters let’s make it legal twitter saves the world againthe accuracy100% agree with this but some of the other shit I’ve seen pisses me off too. I saw some 13yr old little fucked saying she should be “thrown in jail cause she’s a drug user And he doesn’t like it when people use drugs, people can find other ways to deal with problems” OH OK thanks for solving addiction before leaving middle school, why did no one else think of that! 

Also saw some news site bullshit talking about how her family tried to intervene a few weeks ago but it didn’t work (obv), and then basically say she overdosed for attention seeking....  like oh she’s famous and couldn’t possibly have the same issues as ALL OTHER ADDICTS, it must be an attention grab. Most addicts relapse after years sober just to get attention. 

The shitty trend of just wanting views/ likes/ whatever, not caring about truth or integrity, idk man it’s pathetic. And just knowing what it is to be an addict and like how shitty it would be to have people publishing and telling 10’s of thousands of people that you relapsed for attention like damn that is gunna help her for sure. Change takes a while. We butchered Britney in 2007 during her crisis - slowly things are changing imoYup...and they say addicts are the mental ones. Just stop listening to the bullshit and think logically for yourself. Yes, society is and always will be a confused bitch - much like your holy roller mother in law (who did every drug known to mankind back before she lost her memory about it all, has the same wild 80's hairdo with really damaged, bleached hair and can't shut up about everything you do and be gossiped about and belittled by a freaking crazy ass bitch that thinks ppl like "the Long island medium" are the most intelligent and that it could be true about the world being flat. Yup, "society" is a freakin bitch, my friends.I would think that such a high up celebrity OD would raise awareness and break down some of the stigma when dealing with it. demi did heroin fr?Too true SAVE DIACYTLMORPHINE!!! What I don't get is why people have to make this comparison. Most people don't hear about every normal person that overdoses because they're not public figures. The reason people care about this is because this is someone who has been very public about their struggle with sobriety. If anything this is baby steps towards the general public changing their opinions towards all drug addicts. 

Wish we could all just wish her well and a safe recovery instead of comparing her to other people. I saw something today that said "wish people had this same energy when it came to Whitney Houston". Never even thought about that but it's true. Many People don't care unless it's someone they idolize. 

Regardless, I do hope something good can come out of her od. Maybe it'll open people's eyes to the fact that addiction doesn't discriminate. 

also people bashed peep I feel like I tell exactly this to people daily since she OD'd. People always give me shit for it. It's a dumbass world we live in folks. LolWell I for one haven't contributed much to society. Used up way more taxes than I've paid. Healthcare is free here but it's still something relevant to people in the US If I could upvote this several times I oudl#truthNailed it.It's sad society looks at us, as if we are a waste of life. I saw a thread a few months ago about how opiate addicts shouldn't be allowed to get methadone.  It's just disappointing to hear people say we deserve to feel sick, and if we die "we deserved it"
Like. Our lives don't matter since we are addicted.. �She didnt even OD on H, she OD'd on an opiate but not heroin[removed]#SaveTheHeroinlegalize recreational heroinLmao yeah, what a straw man argument. As if you can lump everyone in the world into one category.“People can find other ways to deal with problems” 

*Drug use drops to 0%* 
Wow thanks kid, you just ended drug addiction bless you Leave Britney alone. that was the biggest scandal of my childhood lmao


but yeah i’ve met a lot of ppl now who are supportive rather than judgmentalAt least Britney had the decency to show her monkey though. I can fuckin relate to this, bro!You mean the same way Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s OD really changed things right?LolIt's just pointing out the double standard people have, if the average person hears about someone loosely attached to their social circle ODing they judge them negatively. If it's a celebrity they show empathy.I think its less of a comparison and more of an awareness to treat the people around us physically better. It's not that most people dont hear about the average person ODing, it's the friends or family or acquaintances that everyday people see pass away and trash their legacy. 


They get on social media and bash the person as a lowlife degenerate and their families read this filth. Yes a good percentage of addicts do bad things to support their habits, but a good percentage of the general population is fueled by greed and corruption to have more money than one can comfortably spend, all in the name of the quest for material things. Addicts, for the most part, do their immoral acts and illicit behaviors due to the pain and suffering of withdrawal. Physically feeling like death and mentally wishing for it. It's a rough fucking life nd yeah we tried drugs in the first place, for a multitude of reasons, but we never wished for this life. We wished for escape from pain, heartbreak, boredom, just the monotony of life.


It's what unites us all. Why are soo many average people bashed as hopeless losers even when we DO know their stories, ambitions, families, the good things they've done for people.. but famous people are immediately glorified and "victims." Yet I very rarely see any just average, normal everyday person projected as a victim. I think that's the question these posts are putting out there. Some have been down right mean and wrong to Demi.. but most are just telling people to be more empathetic to those "real" people that we know, love, or actually spend time with in our lives.


I wish nothing but the best for Demi, and I also do for anyone going through this struggle.I don't think that pointing out the hypocrisy in how the media & general public perceive and treat celebrity addicts vs regular addicts implicitly puts Demi Lovato down. I and I'm sure most of us hope she gets the help & treatment she needs and can relate to her far better than most, and I don't think anyone is pushing for or expects every addict that overdoses to be national news, it's just there is still an ever-present stigma associated with addicts (*especially* heroin addicts) - even the word 'junkie' is synonymous with scum and is spat at people in the same way one might say the word 'rapist' or 'rat' - and this vilification is lacking when it's a celebrity who is falling prey to addiction. 

Nobody is suggesting the solution to this is to not support Demi Lovato or to give every overdosing addict a spot on the evening news, but this provides an opportunity to discuss the opioid epidemic and with any luck Ms Lovato will use this attention and her significant influence to cast light on heroin addiction and keep eroding away the counterproductive & harmful stigma that seems to me to be present in the perception of heroin addicts to a much greater degree than practically any other addiction. 

That's all well and good but people that wouldnt normally not think twice about bashing a junkie actually have been looking up to one for years, that's a pretty big step as being seen as equal and getting help in society.Usually you won’t hear about someone’s overdose unless it kills them.  I think the point was that ALL people struggling with addiction should be wished well, not just celebrities.  And that’s not how it is.  No. Just no. People would say the same thing about a black/Asian/Aboriginal person as long as they were a celebrity. It’s called famous privilege. Please don’t be so quick to yell white privilege, especially if it straight up is not valid. Oh godNo. If this were Oprah people would be shocked to hear she had an issue (they’d allow her addiction to be categorized as a disease), and they’d be clicking likes and hearts to show their support, and sending out thoughts and prayers via social media. People would still want to see her be and do well. It’s because she’s famous. 

But your regular ass folk, be they white, Black, Asian, whatever...if you have a problem, you’re scum and stop giving fucking narcan and wasting money on them, let em die with the addiction they chose; it’s not a disease. 

Please don’t with that shit, ok? >straw man

Lots of people actually think that way, it's hardly something that Twitter user just came up with on the spot.The world is trying to move towards identity politics and it’s failing miserably. It’s one of the reasons Trump won. Ha. She is actually doing great now. In shape, dating a 22 year old, killing it in Vegas. She and Lindsay Lohan got little support. Though Lindsay hasn’t really come up from the bottom. My favorite actor, but he doesn't move the needle for the masses like Demi. Yea he’s not quite in the same demographic.Great post, I agree 100%. You're right in that when this happens to a celebrity, opinions seem to be really contrastingly divided between those who seize the opportunity to kick someone while they're down and vilify them and those who immediately craft the cliche "reckless out of control celebrity spirals downhill" narrative, simultaneously fetishising and glorifying their behaviour by paying so much attention to it whilst overtly appearing to maintain a position of disapproval. 

You also make a fantastic point about another difference between how celebrities vs normal addicts are treated - when celebrities develop a drug problem, it's not uncommon to see magazines, newspapers, talk shows etc to immediately ask why this has happened, try and trace it back to some career misstep or a relationship breakdown or the influence of another celebrity or a childhood trauma etc. In doing so, the media paint a clear picture of a person who is going through a drug problem.

Contrastingly, if a non-famous drug addict is in a position where they receive media attention like if they're related or in a relationship with a celebrity or they're involved or have witnessed a crime etc, they are just written off as a junkie or a drug addict. Whilst the celebrity is a person who is going through a drug problem, the normal addict is just a drug addict/junkie, as if that is their whole identity and they are the embodiment of a drug addict - no need to ask why the person is a drug addict, that would be like asking why a person has blue eyes, that is just who they are. 

This attitude isn't just limited to the media, but I have found it to be the opinion shared by the majority of people, especially those who don't take any illegal drugs themselves. In branding someone a junkie you simultaneously strip them of their humanity and reduce them to their biggest problem and their worst struggle, and it must be difficult for someone to quit when all those around them no longer see past their drug problem at the person behind it all - why quit when everyone sees you as nothing more than a junke anyway? Well said, at least you see why ppl are mad and sad. I just read on tmz that she turned down help weeks ago from ppl around her...i wish some of my dead friends could of had that chance to get clean but they didn't have enough money to get good help. They was lucky if detox took them for 72 hours. And. Then it was oh okay, get out back to the street. Unless you have money for a rehab or halfway house because we have no beds left for youNailed it :)But the opiate epidemic is being treated very differently than the crack epidemic of the 80s that was destroying mostly black neighborhoods. People now care when it’s their suburban children that are getting strung out. I agree with you partly!!! I think it's both and will continue to think it I didn't see people I feel sorry for Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. But instead they made jokes. And look what happen to that family...I stand behind what i said.I agree. But I also think that things are no longer race related more so rich vs poor. Poor whites are looked down on just as much as ghetto blacks. 

The opiate epidemic is truely being treated different than the crack opiate of the 80s. The fact is that this epidemic is effecting people from suburban communities compared to cracks effects on mainly poor urban black. I’m just saying it’d make more sense if they chose a specific person. There’s a lot of compassion for addicts these days, and there’s been a lot of mean spirited Demi memes. There’s assholes and good people in every cross section of society.Hasn’t she? I thought she was laying low in the UAE, opening up spas and shit, and doing well? Fucking bingo. People just look at us with an entirely different mindset. As soon as your junkie secret is out that's it. Unless you're uncomfortably vocal about you're recovery , even if you do get clean its still the same:  untrustworthy, will steal any chance they get, liars, definitely never give cash and always be suspicious of the addict.


Its frustrating talking to so many people: at work, loved ones, etc., and especially those that have never touched anything but some pot, talk so down about addicts. My secret is still hidden but that door is unlocked and opens a little more each month so I still hear their real opinions, shit they wouldnt say to an addict even. Just really makes me so sad to be honest. Why hate an entire group of suffering people- the majority nowadays are good hardworking people that must hide their shame.Exactly, i said the same thing...I've seen it all my life living in the hood Most people who hate junkies would hate all junkies, of every race, equally. Please explain to me how this is white privilege? Bingo. But some ppl will never see it that way, maybe because it didn't happen to ppl they knew.  idk but it's selfish and a shame imoWell her career is over cause its too expensive for Hollywood studios to insure her (you have to get insurance for every big budget film) but to me she seems in a place where she is happy and has a lot of successful business ventures. She also said she used ayahuasca to get permanently sober. Doesnt seem like her "bottom" to me, just a different outcome than she and other people wanted.i haven’t seen her in any movies lately tho

she was in machete that was the last i saw of herI'm not here to explain my mind and things i choose to believe to ,you. Go look up the the past at how junkies were treated, compared to now...it's only like this now because it's white ppl who are strung out the most and not the ghetto population... if it was still majority the ghetto population you wouldn't hear anything about we need to get these people help. You say something like that you should be able to justify it, or least give some reasoning to your opinion. And junkies are starting to get treated better today because addiction has become know as a disease in medical professional rather than a behavioral disorder, however we are still in the transitional phase of this and it while Sounds like your mad at my opinion. Well that's just it, mine, not yours....i really don't understand why you think i need to justify something to you. I'm a grown man who has a backbone so, I'm not gonna just do what you think i should do to please you.  Are you trying to tell me what I'm allowed to think and say??? Please answer me that... Because you don't see me chastising you're thinking, I actually agreed with you on something and some things I didn't. But for the sake of your health you should really stop trying to put words in people's mouths and telling them what they should do and shouldn't do... that's almost the same thing as bullying somebody and people tend to frown upon that. so don't try to bully me little man I think he was just trying to get your reasoning behind your opinion. To better understand and then either have counter points or maybe concede on some things due to being able to understand your POV better. Kinda the point of the subreddit, discussing things with other people. Your deflections don’t really make it seem like your sitting on a whole bunch of good reasons for thinking thatIf you’re a “grown man with a backbone” you should be willing to stand up for your opinion and provide information behind your logic. To just say something and then defend it stubbornly by basically just saying “because I said so” you are acting like a child. I’m not necessarily mad at your opinion, I would just love to try and understand it. Your whole demeanor is so off putting dude; I wasnt getting aggressive with you, maybe frustrated, then you start calling me “little man”, dude you don’t fucking know me, I don’t know you, better not to make personal remarks just stick to the facts provided by the text. As a black man I am aware of white privilege, it just doesn’t apply to this post; like you admitted to another person here, all I asked was that you told me how it applied to this post, if you know it doesn’t; then say so, you fuckin clownI don't have a whole bunch of reasons.  Only a few...shit, i mean I'm a white drug user myself but i still see the white privilege thing happen all day. I could sit here and act like it doesn't happen all day long but it does, I might have been wrong in this situation to use that analogy. but trust me it definitely holds up in the real world...I'm don't mean to come off as bitter but why can't everyone get the same kind of help as everyone else, skin color or status, should not matter......but i already know I'm preaching to the choir here on getting ppl to change how they think about thing's so i won't even try.  But i bet more ppl will still try to change how i think.....i don't get humans Like i said in the previous post, it doesn't have anything to do with it. I even said it was wrong and out of context. But at the same time it's the same people who trash junkies that aren't rich and famous. That embraces the junkies who are famous and or rich...how come we don't ever make a big deal about Wayne oding on lean and having seizures?, but instead we hear about johnny minzal (or how ever you spell it) drinking all the time and needing help with it...look at when Lamar Odom oded and was in a coma for how ever long. The only ppl besides the Kardashians who gave any support & love is bb players and rappers. Why i just don't get it?  Aren't we all human beings who need empathy and love every once and a while?....oh and i don't mean to be off putting, i just have strong feelings toward it and it may come off as assholeish. But I felt you were try to order me in to giving you answers that frankly i don't have to do even if i was in the wrong or not. Because As a grown man i can say and do as i please, as can you, so why does it matter if i did really feel like this is white privilege or not?  I'm allowed to feel like that if i please aren't i ?  there you go talking shit again like i need to justify myself to some internet random or anybody for that matter.    If i was in front of you i would tell you the same thing. You can say I'm being childish and call me a clown all you like pimp, it doesn't bother me like it does you.   Stop thinking ppl owe you something and have to answer a question just because you ask them to.....little boy acting ass grown man go play in the sand box. And kick rocks with your needing an anwser ass...lol Nah b I 100% am with you on the fact that white privilege is way too real and prevalent and disgusting. I don’t think it applies to this comparison from the OP, but I really hope most people would admit that it’s a real thing. It would be incredibly naive to not acknowledge it. Also a kind of commentary about white privilege in and of itself lol 

Like I support you calling it out I try and do the same but I just don’t see it with the post here. And I’m not even saying you should change your opinion and I don’t think the other guy was either I think he just wanted to know why you thought it applied here idk tho can’t speak for them. 

Keep fighting the good fight tho homie Cool  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: No replacement, Content: , ups: 1163, downs: 0See your homeland, swing on the tire swing, look at the stars, roll in the grass, run with your dog, talk with friends (in person) in front of a raging camp fire. drink cheap beer, sing, dance if you like it, Play.

The problem here is that people think life is about having a job, a car, and a roof over your head.  
That's what society tells us, and in some ways that's what actually drives some of us to the drugs.  This tyranny of mundane normality is a façade.Got 2 years clean . I’d nvr be able to do it with out some type of high . Luckily weed has been enough for me so far Right in the feels. Man this sober shit be boring as fuck. I dont know how some people do it for real. Like Idk, ive been forced into getting sober and in the depths of what you would call addiction, tried rehab and everything else. Once I got out of legal trouble and able to have freedom,again I started using drugs again but I keep it way way more low-key and its been fine so far... Like I just need a chemical outlet to not go insanebruh life is boring afLearn to be sober not just with your actions, but in your thoughts too, both conscious and unconscious a like. This will be a daunting task, but after some time your efforts will result in a changed perspective. This will allow you to feel freer from the weight of addiction than you had  ever before dreamt possible. Find a place where you can make yourself uncomfortable yet maintain  your stability. Complacency is a slow cancer that can cause relapse albeit subtly. So, being able to mix things up while still maintaining can seem intimidating, but once you finally master this skill your spiritual and emotional growth will astound you. Proof that growth comes from learning while being uncomfortable. Take control of your mind, don’t allow yourself to be imprisoned by it. Like I said before with time and training, discipline, patience you will eventually learn how to combat those demons in a healthier manner ultimately giving you an overall better quality of life. Remember to keep the long game in the back of your mind for right now and focus on the present. Like the old adage goes, “one day at a time.” Just abstaining isn’t enough, you have to re-wire your brain. 

Edit: some words, thanks for the kind dm’s for anyone out there who is struggling with addiction I too love with that beast constantly crawling up my back so feel free to message me if you need a homie to talk too! I'm not an opioid user but I can relate in the sense that once you feel how great some of these drugs can make you feel, sober life just isn't the same.This is how everyone feels. But almost everyone agrees its better to the alternative. If you ever feel bored think about the reasons you stopped, all the fucked up shit you don't want to see yourself do again.This is literally how I feel everyday. I thought everything would be great once I attained these things, but still just feels shitty1 week sober and I don’t think I’m following the right path �Life isn't enough. I demand euphoriaWhy we must fight our oppressors Yup. 2 months sober and I feel exactly like that lil fish Congrats!!! It feels good doesn't it!!!I have acquired 1.5 of these in the last 15mos. Doing something wrong stillYep I just feel like I wasn't meant to live in this time period. Paleolithic era is where it's at living in nature and shit. Here is the deal, life has to have a purpose and meaning. There has to be an overarching plan or purpose to existing, or is simply base mechanics(eat, work, poop, pee, sleep) with varying distractions. This will become apparent once even hedonism becomes boring, and lol it will eventually.

&#x200B;

This purpose or meaning can be different for everyone, I have a kid I love. Shit I like to get buzzed and take him to the carnival or whatever, I actually like spending time with him.

&#x200B;

If it wasn't for that I'd probably have suicided by now with a big gram shot of fent, I just don't care otherwise.3 mo sober and I'm more lazy now than I ever was on drugsI think the key to the sober life is to have something you love to do.It gets better. You can always drop acid every once in a while lol.pretty close to how i feel, but i still use drugs..Why did you have to post this right before I plan to get clean :/LMAO! 

It’s called being a “dry drunk”. Thanks NA! ��Went 2,5 months sober, ‘relapsed’ a week ago. Had some fun a couple of days and now have to restrain from using some time to not get addicted. 
There is really nothing like Opioids.This is 100% me_irl. I cant get over the anhedonia and depression and then relapse. And for a small time there is color to my world again. And this is why I’m still a heavy poly drug user![deleted]Annnnnddddddd it's gone (south park voice) Sobriety blows I used to be in this boat but i basically feel like i did before using. Still on suboxone tho. Smoking weed really helps. If you're bored while sober, just try pursuing your lifes passion. You dont have to be a parent and wage slave to exist on earth. Do whatever the fuck you want. Well just a thought: how exciting is life on dope? Sure you feel good just sitting there, but you're not earning it. It sucks but I think we need to force ourselves to have fun the normal way.This is it.. Happiness is just molecules in brain Well yeah, I'd feel like shit too if my cubicle had no way to out without climbing over the neighboring ones. 

Nah, I know I'm taking that picture too literally. I get it; I think it's shitty that people who work in call center cubicles work to fund their car and insurance. They'd probably be happier on a lower paying job that was a block away from home if they didn't need the car for much else. A lot of the people I worked with didn't use the car for anything else but commuting to and from work as well as food shopping which is cheap enough to have delivered nowadays.


Some days I feel bleh and don't feel like I can get myself out of that pit, but I usually do. Still, I worry about how I'll feel when I taper off subs. Ok, so I totally do not get being bored in sobriety.

Can you list some stuff that upsets you specifically? 

There is so much stuff to be interested in, it is literally ridiculous. I mean, do you read about these incredible people jumping off mountains in wing suits, and you can actually tell me that life is boring? I want to do that!

Yes, most of us have to work for a living. It is a shame that we cannot play 24/7.  But there it is. Even working 8 hours a day, that still leaves a shitload of time to do fun stuff.

I absolutely do not understand this.  I was a hardcore IV junkie for 11 years, but am clean now. All I have to do to start having fun is literally step outside my front door. Because then I am going to start running into my neighbors and every one of them has a cool story to tell.

The old guys are all about life in the 50s and 60s, which was amazing. The younger guys talk about their sports and their game playing in the corporate world, which if you listen, is shockingly fun. And the girls. OMG the girls. A big smile. Hey what's up? Yeah, I love the neighborhood too. Really, you like (fill in the blank) music? So do I!

And it is off to the races.

The alternative? Well I guess I could hit a big shot of dope and go to sleep. Man, that is just soooo interesting.  Whoops, what do you mean it is 2019? You mean I missed the last five years? Damn, I don't remember them very well. Did I really do that?

Yes, I know, society sucks. Life is not fair. People are stupid. Yada Yada.

I don't think you are trying very hard.

Just my opinion.Add a little weed and therapy and it can get funI feel this man, up until this relapse I was feeling dreadful. I still feel guilty about relapsing, but that's mostly because my family thinks i'm done with the stuff, but that's a fat lie. I've relapsed like 8 times this year. I'm in an internal battle of making my family happy, or making myself happy. And I don't know how much longer I can do the former, I hate myself lately and oxy brings out my confidence and gives me happiness, even if it's artificial. I'll take any happiness I can get at this point.I think it has to do w the way our brains are wired in expectation of instant gratification.  Drugs are excellent choices as vehicles of delivering instant gratification.  When you get clean and are sober, most of the “great” or “exciting” things take TIME to build and develop. Being so used to instant gratification from drugs, the wait for such things to happen to us is “too long”, we get inpatient, and complain that sober living is “boring”.  

[deleted]Doing cardio to exhaustion as much as you can will boost your mood tremendously. Probably the last thing you want to do, but eventually you yearn for that dompamine dump. Better than any drug. Also a quality fish oil supplement in high doses (5 pills/day) will at least make you feel happy. Hope this is helpful. Hahahaha so true. Sigh.Why why why is it like this? How do people like tracey415 get 21 years but I can't even get 3 monthsIs like, you start being addict for some reason, you weren't a asshole, or not that asshole. When stop to taking drugs you have to front this shitty life, problems or feelings which made you take the decision to fucked up.Preach, year and a half sober for the most part. Well if you dont count drinking like a fish every night. Which by the way definitely comes no where close to some dope.Dude I fucking love this comment.This comment is perfection! Started using many different drugs because i can't stand the thought of just living a normal life, just having a prestigeous job, a wife with kids and house to full fill societies thoughts of a "normal" life. In the end, listening and dancing to music makes me truly happy. Sorry for my english it's not my native languageSo if I wander thru the woods alone tonight I’ll feel fulfilled?You got it. But you forgot the part where everything pushes one way where natural contentment and joy is usually another. i like the high i get when i do things like skateboarding, camping, swimming, skiing etc.  Cant stand pot anymore for some reason. Makes me self analyze too much I am sure you have probably thought of this already but is it possible that you are trying to self medicate for what may be underlying depression or anxiety?

I had a very difficult time quitting opiates because I was not being treated for depression. So as if kicking drugs weren't hard enough already,  the only thing I came back to was depression. Being medicated by a doctor for that issue made it much easier to feel okay without being on opiates.I'm in the same boat as you I don't like weed at all sadly, I just use it for sleep. Nothing will ever give me that same happiness as oxyI wish I could be like you. I used to smoke weed everyday and that would be my exit route if I were to stay clean. I want to be completely clean but my lungs went through a lot of damage from a pneumonia I caught where my body went into septic shock and was left for dead. Luckily I was given another chance at life but I keep feeling guilty from my drug use :/  That’s how I thought about it for a long time, but I realized I’d just be nodding off somewhere doing nothing. Sure, I’d feel good but I’d somehow be doing even less than I do sober. Fuckin mind games manI've always thought that the people that can get sober for good, never had much of an issue with drugs in the first place. Find something exciting, go be a smokejumper. Parachute into wildfires for a living... If you are bored I'm sure you hate your job but you can change that and will have to if you want to *really* get better.Your comment hit me right in the feels Dude I related to this so much. Like shit hit the fan and I went to rehab/halfway and worked the whole 12 steps and even sponsored 2 guys. Was sober for a while but now I just smoke weed everyday and pop a pill here and there but shit even when everything is going good it’s just so boring... The key is, switch your drugs, dont just use opiods.

One day you get drunk, then opiods, then lsd, then stims, so on[deleted]Golden advice You must blaze your own path, a job by definition is helping someone else achieve their dreams.Wat..?I was just talking to my mom about this. 
You’re absolutely right that **most** people *need* purpose in their life. For some reason it seems unnatural to not have it and it makes people depressed and hate themselves.
 
For some reason I’ve always flourished and never gotten bored of the hedonistic lifestyle. Doing nothing but what I want and having no drive to mean anything in the world has been just fine with me. 

It’s when I stop living the bum, party and drug fueled lifestyle that I get depressed. Even with purpose, like the many schools I went to, I just wanted to quit and get high instead ��‍♀️Very true, although the addiction recovery programs in my area do not address dual diagnosis.  Some people with mood disorders, for example, detox just sweats you through your DOC.  Then, the PROGRAM in my area is the 12 steps that says no meds at all and essentially genetic mental disorders are a character defect.

Sorry if I am bring up an old thread or replying in the wrong place.  Opiates, alcohol, uppers, whatever, if you are even in treatment for a serious mental disease that will never go away...add life stress....it is Very hard to not want to escape one’s existence.

My bro and I are ravaged by the same disease....I wonder daily if he is gone down the H rabbit hole forever.  I’m no innocent..  we both did programs,  he even delved in 12 step but could not make amends. That step. But that ... anyway thanks for reading.  Typing sober.  Psychedelics don't compare to hard drugs unfortunately plus they can be too anxiety inducing in some people, they aren't for everyone.gotta love NA.   I must be an obese slim guy  ���

Surely these NA guys who are 5+ years clean, spend 4 hours a day in meetings, yet "never think about drugs"  -  are straight up honest people too ���That’s how I hope to use in the future. 

1 month clean, binge for a day or two, then restart. Why are you getting downvoted? Its kinda messed up for drug users, ostracized for finding happiness in something considered "unnacceptable," to be ostracizing you for finding happiness in something they don't like. Kinda hypocritical, if you ask meHigher power as in God and shit like that? ... it’s not about the car ...You gotta get a decent job that you don't hate IMO if you want to stay clean.

No way could I have stuck out my old callcentre job while in WD's or clean, it was just a hateful place. Just like in the spongebob image. My current job on the other hand, I am not forced to get high to make it through a shift;  I ended up getting high after work as it was the long evenings where I got bored and wanted to get high. That's how I ended up getting hooked badly. I remember the first time I used during a work shift, I didn't really like it at first as I thought "damn people might notice"   (but in the past 5 or so years my tolerance was so high I appear completely 100% normal)Exercise is super cliche, but is legit the only somewhat “chemical” replacement for opiates and for depression In sober life. And I don’t mean light exercise I mean heavy runners high type. kids also certainly give you fulfillment and motivation. I didn’t read through every post but keep trying,  keep your head up, good luck! P.s methadone taper is a great way to eliminate cravings and ease into it and some people just stay on it!How do you drink like a fish every night while maintaining your sobriety lmaoTry baclofen, its like alcohol's suboxone.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/)Thank you... Ive felt the way the meme describes as well, but only until I began to find real life again.  Not what they tell us life is.  your English was fine.  Thank you.  :-)This is almost the choose life speech Only if you do it in the nude.  :-p  

Im not sure what types of low cost worldly things u might like.  We are all different.  but the key thing is to try it after a few months of sobriety.
Yes. society wants us to be a certain way, and its hard to resist that.[deleted]I used to love skateboarding but the gym has been my high lately. I’m also 2 years off dope. 

What do you like to skate? I’ve always been into big gaps and stairs growing up but I really want to learn transition Same thing happened to me. I quit around age 21 cuz I kept thinking I wasn’t doing shit with my life. I felt guilty about things. I didn’t realize the reason I felt so unhappy when I’d smoke. I just knew it was amplifying my unhappiness. So I stopped for nearly a decade. I’m in such a better place now in my life, and I’m just...content. So now when I smoke I can really enjoy it and laugh at tv or sit on Reddit like right now. I think it all comes down to the pressure you feel in life. That shit gets heavy when you let it. Some years ago a friend asserted that different weed strains made them feel differently. One time I bought a shitty vape oil that sucked but had info on the label saying "this sativa is more energizing" and this other one is "more sedating and... stuff."

Recently I had a bag of Sour Diesel and another containing some kind of Cush. I believe it was the Sour that made me feel anxious, even before bed.... including that introspection, that self analysis going on in my head. 


The following day and days I smoked the other shit until I ran out and the Cush did not apepar to affect me the same way I eventually had to go back to smoking the Sour until I ran out and bought more. 


It wasn't terrible, but I felt like when on the recent batch of cush I felt better psychologically and emotionally. While getting a good night's sleep. Most any weed will make me feel anxious if I smoke it in the day time especially if I gotta go to work.... but if I smoke a batch and don't feel that way during the day then I'm impressed by the strain.[deleted]Omg yes, absolutely. That's a really good point honestly and I agree with it. Not to downplay anyones struggle but once you open pandoras box o' drugs it seems impossible to even go backWhat’s for good though? I have 1 year and 1 day clean and I’m 28 I won’t get into my story but I started iving herion at 18. So if I stay sober until the day I die of natural causes I ain’t ever had an issue but god forbid I relapse which I know is a heavy possibility i might have some issues or if I od in the mcdonalds bathroom and don’t get brought back someone might say damn yo he had some issues he should’ve got help!  Said it many times but i used dope compulsively to the point my kidneys were failing. I still chain smoke cigs and weed trying to get that miniscule hit of dopamine but im clean from heroin/subs 1 year+. Until I get cancer im going to stay off opiates, then im going back full force.Well, that's simply false. Fair and fascinating statement. This is basically why I hope I continue to be reluctant to say "if I could do it..." It's not fair for those who just have a different balance of chemistry in their brain and bodies. It doesn't make them any less of a person and I'm sure it would be way harder for me to be where I am today if I was successful with my IV attempts or if I was in the game for longer before beginning to kick.Yeah man. Swear it can tear you up inside. I mean on one hand you should stay "clean and sober" and live the good life....yeah and then on the other its like the good life is a fucking joke and so boring you wanna just quit it completely. Besides there is nothing wrong with using drugs recreationally once in a while, we just like to take it too far. 

Besides, what do we as humans exist to do? What do are our brains built to do? EXPERIENCE PLEASURE... 

 Its one of those "do I have a problem or is it everybody else?" Type of situations. Im with you but opioids are the best drugs there are, there's no argument about it. Not to mention opioids seem to kick way harder than usual if you've been up a couple of days on stimulants. but you hurt others and might die thoSounds about right, always blazed my own pathOf this list I have 1 thing (a job) and half a roof over my head and I have 15mos clean. Not doing so well compared to this.I know I feel better in life when I don't have a plan and just go with the flow I've noticed...I was never that way though. I always thought I had to do shit by the books. I don't know why but I HAD TO!!! I had a baby really fucking young and dropped out of school but I had to get my Ged and get a job. You would think I'd be happy but I wasn't. I had anxiety like a motherfucker. 

My kids dad committed suicide and it wasn't until then that I really understood my life. After that I guess my life took a turn on some spiritual type journey but it was different than anything I experienced before. It completely turned my world upside down but I found myself happier with my life turned upside down. Almost like you're focused on over coming that tragedy or something. Lol I don't even know if any of this makes sense... 
And when my life gets more stable I start to get more depressed. Kinda like deep inside I don't want to be stable. But I don't know why I wouldn't. I really do envy the people who can just do drugs and stay up all night and don't have to take care of their kids. They can do what they want. But I don't know if I would ever really be happy if I lived that kind of life. Lol it's confusing...Don't be sorry, this discussion is really important and useful. We're (mostly) all still here but the problems also remain. Some people have to play a really terrible hand in life because what's given is in your DNA and there is very little that can be done, medically. When that dysfunction is mental, that is a double penalty because we understand so little about the mental side of health. The drugs are really a sledgehammer to crack a nut but what choice do we have? If you feel bad and you don't know why, the drugs are very appealing. And now you have a new problem.

In my own case, I don't believe I have any major mental health issues but they still brought me very low, to a dark place I never imagined I would go. It took me years of self reflection and therapy to recover but I found a way and now I'm quite happy. When I say the key to the sober life is to find something you love I suppose what I mean is you have to find your particular way. You have to keep experimenting with a new approach and observing the results. Discard the things that don't work and keep the ones that do. Each person is different, there is no magic formula. Also writing sober.Hence the lol. No, I think EVERYONE should drop acid/SAll they do is talk about drugs and the good old days!Good luck with that[deleted]I didn't down vote bcs I respect those who choose to believe but what put me off was the fact that he implies that we, for some fkn reason, need to create an idea in our minds of a higher power bigger than us controlling our lives just to be able to cope with existence and carry on. To me, it sounds like putting a band in front of your eyes and just ignore the whole thing. Yeah, getting food on the table is higher on the priority list.thanks!! i ran a mile last night (took me 9 minuets lol.. I'm 6'3 175... felt 5'7 250 ha) and have been doing 40-50 pushups daily. Not much but i can feel a little difference I want to get back into it.   I used to have an exercise addiction and sustained a lot of permanent damage with chronic pain...but I can swim and walk.  I did myself in on the runners high, but I already had problems and kept going. Highly recommend if you can do in moderation. Baclofen is the bee’s knees �I am going the other. I have thought alot about this. I am going to help others do so as well, and remove anyone who tries to stand in the way. Thank you.  I never really saw them as addictions, but I suppose they are :-)
I just recently got an Eboard!  Inboard M1 :-)Well spoken man. Thank you Yeah, absolutely. It’s pretty difficult to change your perspective on what’s fulfilling and what’s not, but it can be done. Drugs are an easy way to shortcut in to that fulfillment, although usually with negative repercussions following if left unchecked> The issue is that 'doing' things that are considered worthwhile net zero fulfillment once you've experienced the pleasure of IV hard drugs. This is especially true if those things are monetarily driven. 


Get into astrophotography, it's quite the money pit but if you got money that isn't making you happy - perhaps spending it on such a hobby will bring happiness. Okay, it's not for everyone... I might get a $1500 mount shipped to me after it being back ordered for over a month only to discover that I get bored taking pictures of the moon and Jupiter under light-polluted skies.


Honestly though, I think I would feel emotionally less satisfied if it wasn't for my turtles and their existence in my life. They remind me that I need to forge onward and find more shit that brings joy to my life. Maybe I'm just afraid to leave them alone, or afraid to consider what it would be like for the remainder of my family to take care to my turtles if I were to meet my demise from an overdose.


I've never experienced IV heroin properly, but I got a glimpse of the sensation with my homemade rig. It was more numbing for me than blissful but a warm blanked regardless of the minutiae which comes to mind. It's easier to list negative reasons for going down that road, the IV drugs and snorted opiates road. All the while it's harder to list things which bring joy after experiencing that.



Working for a living, living the dream or the robotic existence as seen in the picture is quite soul draining and a walk in the park on Saturdays doesn't cut it. I've seen men work all their lives only to deteriorate within a decade of retirement and die. Sure, it's nice knowing that your progeny get your money but such a man who worked his ass off deserved to reap fruits of his labor.  


I don't know where I'm going with this now, pardon my rant. Your statement was far more succinct and poignant. Do you spend anytime outside doing activities you enjoy? I find that is a great way to enjoy some sober fun and get away from the grind.Nicotine makes me sick, I still indulge on occasion but I swear if I smoke a couple of hours after my sub dose I'm more likely to feel nauseous. 

There was a time I could burn a pack a day will little to no ill effects (at least none I can recall) t now if I chain-smoked three in an hour I would feel some kind of way.

I tend to prefer cowboy killers but everyone I know basically smokes menthols.Do you do all the NA / Jesus  stuff? I'm looking into the most sucessful clean people and it seems a lot of them do this NA / Jesus stuff,  unfortunately I just can't bring myself to believe in the supernatural :(You sound like me.  I always say someday I’ll go back to them but today I’m as sober as I can be (kratom and soon medical marijuana).  Heroin does not cause kidney failure.It’s just so ignorant thisyeah no other drug interests me.  Stims nope, weed (hate it), alcohol (too impairing and depressing),  LSD not for me;  opiates are the perfect drug for me personally.  I have friends who hate opiates and am amazed I like them so much, but then the same goes for their DoC's for me[deleted][deleted]1st. Yes, much of that didn’t make much sense. 

2nd. In your first paragraph you say “You would think I'd be happy” — no, I wouldn’t think that. Sounds terrible. My bad lol man we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha. 

And maybe you're right... everyone should take acid/S to open their 3rd eye and get their chakra into alignment and the we can have a new awaking and become the United States of Consciousness... Since it was your idea you can be our new enlightened president. :o :DYou'd be +100 if you had said this the first time, ain't no-one dumb enough for that Jesus shit in 2019Now try that stuff high. LmaoYou’re welcome. This.   Seeking fulfillment is what we are all after.  It is much more difficult to do in the real world sober and it damn near looks impossible once you have taken a pill,snorted or IV a drug and achieved that fulfillment immediately.   That being said if you work hard at fulfillment in sobriety (this means lots of work on mental health - therapy/possibly medication) it can be just as good as the opioid euphoria.  Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. Did you consider having kids/a family?  I thought maybe having a wife and kids might make me happy but honestly my friends with wives/kids; they want to take any opportinity to get out of their houses and come out with us single guys; it's a lot of hard work. My happiest friend is the one who lives aloneYeah, it's true.. even if I'm resistant to it - it always helps lift my mood to go outside for any reason.No, I go to a 666 step program at our lady of the dark lord satanic cathedral.Not in and of itself, but the impurities of street drugs combined with the lifestyle and the muscle deterioration when falling out can cause kidney issues without a doubt. Happened to me. The only stim I like is amphetamine, (which I take most days in the form of adderall), I love weed too and I think weed really shines when you are under the influence already, especially with opioids. 

Other than drinking a bit every now and then, I don't really care for much else. Benzos, psychs, dissos, etc. Are pretty much garbage imo and I dont bother with em. 

Its just that opioids are good literally whenever. I could write a book about why I like opis the best but ill spare everyone, bottom line, they just feel the best. drug usage itself is not necessarily hurtful to others but the illness called addiction is damaging to you and your environment. there is also a difference between recreational and therapeutical usage.others can also be for example neighbors, people you stealing from, your colleagues, family members, partners... society gets hurt by addiction, addicts can’t help it but denying the damage that is done is fueling the desire to use.

of course you are going to die, dying from drugs can be very sudden and early in life.This!I was chosen> we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha.

... can’t tell if you are being sarcastic or not.

But by ending his comment with /s , he was showing sarcasm. [deleted]My first thought � Feel like Jon Stewart in half baked. Ive done it all high... And I thought I had to keep doing it high.   I quit getting high for a time (I wont quit forever) and I quit doing most of those things for awhile as well.  Then after a few months I went back and started some of those things again, or for the first ttime.  I don't know if I will ever reach that same euphoria, I havnt had a relationship since I was 14 (almost 21 now) and have been rejected countless times. My friends barely hangout with me, i'm just so depressed and so damn lonely. Oxy is the only thing that fills the void in my heart. It doesn't help that all throughout high school I was bullied so much that it scarred me emotionally. People treat me like i'm just a junkie and that i'm going to abuse everything i get my hands on. My friends were worried and mad I got an adderall and vyvanse script, yet I havnt abused either and only have abused adderall prior to getting a script when I was in my darkest times. My friends and doctor don't trust me with a benzo script either even though i suffer from panic attacks every week, and I only had xanax in my blood from abuse once when I tried to commit suicide with it and risperadone. Now I can't get benzo scripts unless it's the ER, all because I was suicidal. I don't know what i'm even getting at man life just sucks so much these last few months. Thank god I found some percs, too bad it's my friends grandmas last script, so she wont be able to sell me them anymore after that.The problem is our socieities are not setup this way, life in daily grind is not conducive to this fulfillment. We can try, though. > Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. 

This is my favorite go-to when my friend Tim asks, "do you miss doing dope?"I have found strangely the more opiates I have, the less I think about them - that is if I buy a months supply off the DNM's, I won't really think about them other than doing my dose after work and enjoying the evenings. 

Whereas in WD's I think about them all the time (obviously early wd's you can't focus on anything else; in later WD's you remember the good times)

yet if I am in a dry spell I think a lot more about where I'll get them from - I guess it's the same thing if you were running out of water.

I also think if you use opiates as a crutch to help you with a life/job you hate, that is when you are going to run into much bigger problems staying clean.  I am lucky in a sense I only used them because I enjoyed getting high - I didn't use them to escape any mental stress or any physical pain - they would just be two major triggers to continue using againYes, especially since my brother and wife are planning not to and want to keep their money for vacations and trips to matha's vineyard.

I'm banking on the fact that as a man my ability to produce viable source DNA will last through my 50s.  I want to get my childishness out of my system, learn to or find ways to make more money or get a more established career. Only then would I want to have children. Although I might meet someone and accelerate the turn table, I wont bring children into this world if I can't provide for them. At least, I'd prefer to avoid that stress factor. 


I would love to be like my mom's cool cousin who is single and chills out collecting comic books and whatnot, but I my father's genetics can't afford that level of selfishness. If we are to continue his genes and my genes - I must procreate, eventually. 

I hope to be an older father with money, with a unique peace of mind that comes from experience. Whether I have a boy or girl. Even if my daughter is "hot", I want us to have a good relationship that ensures that she is armed to make good decisions but also free to make her decisions without worrying about me being a judgmental dick about things.

If I have a boy, I my biggest fear is that they'll be lazy and stupid because of modern tech. I might just make my kids uses old technology for a few years and pretend that it's normal. Then again, they will need to learn to code very early on.


I want it both ways.[deleted]Iphone addicti9n and social media are also harmful to us all but are you gonna prosetlyize against that None of us asked to be conceived or born, we never asked to be raised to adulthood, we owe society 0.

I'm in this game for ME, the only person I will work to benefit that isn't me is my child. The rest are on their own.Oh ok lol I never knew that ending things with "/s" meant it was sarcastic.Nah my man, they clearly ain't all that intelligent if so.Yess!! That one dude that does everything sober but then tries it high. You ever smoked weed...on WEED man?one of my best "highs" ever was on Day 6 or 7 of an oxy kick, first real day of hot sun during the year (UK is a real depressing place most days),  the natural endorphins were flowing; went for a walk in the woods with some ambient music in on my own.  It sounds so lame to read it back now but it was a great sober high.  Unfortunately you can only get this pink cloud by going through 5 days of WD's...

Now if there was only a way to re-create this high on demand, say by ingesting something... but alasI could relate to some extent with two aspects. First with regard to bullying, high school was fine but Junior High School sucked real bad. I wasn't an angel either, I did some edgy things for the sake of fun and amusement which got me in trouble during the lunch period. I remember one time everybody wanted to play basketball but the gym teacher wanted everyone to sit on the bleachers first. Well, I couldn't find a seat and when I did find one in the back corner near the edge, a couple of African-American students were sliding horizontally down the bench into me in order to make me fall off. So I said to myself (probably), "fuck it, I'll just stand next to the bleachers on the floor."


&nbsp;


Perhaps I was a bit aloof, but because I wasn't sitting down the teacher was like "everyone's not sitting down so you all can't play basketball." After that mad black folks (the majority of this class) were ragging on me and beating up on me, only one was at least kind enough to provide clarification as to why they were all pissy. I sorted my shit out but I always felt like very few members of faculty had my back - probably because they had a lot to manage as the school was basically overpopulated on the whole.


&nbsp;

Then if that's not enough, my "best friends" at the time were hit-or-miss. Snotty about academics, but not too good to take shortcuts and cheat on exams when possible. Perhaps I should've employed more of the same tactics, the truth is that I'm too lazy to do my school work - cheating or not. I hate when they used to send out deficiency notices in the middle of the semester - sort of like a midterm report card. One time I'm walking home with my "friends" on that day when we got deficiency notices and my "friend" is just basically telling me "you're a lazy bitch." Be that as it may, although I'm definitely not a bitch in any form.. it's none of his fucking business. 


&nbsp;

One smart Jewish-Christian friend was snotty but he did honest work and achieved a lot of shit as well as extra-curricular shit. The other friend who called me a "lazy bitch" was more hardcore Jewish - raised by an Israeli father. He didn't have the best home life, bullied by his brother Derrick (same one who middles dope) and so  I think it was just reflex for him to be a dick about shit. We all matured, I mean like I still wouldn't have him do my taxes as he is an accountant now because of the shame associated with making less money and letting him see that fact.


&nbsp;

Now, back to you... I often feel down and sure, Xanax would help, Valium would be wonderful too but there is so much downside potential associated with becoming dependent on either. \*\*Physical activity always helps me feel better and cuts back on anxiety.\*\* Sometimes I find it hard to start, many days I look forward to the end so that I can go to bed - sometimes I go to bed way earlier than possible. I slept 12 hours last week in one night because of that. 


&nbsp;


I'm still very confused about how my emotions work when I wake up super early so that I can have "me time" before work. I get super tired in the afternoon and then I get a second wind later in the evening.. it's like my biological clock is tuned for a "better mood" at certain times.


&nbsp;


What I want to convey is, how we feel today is an amalgamation of shit that has happened before - which we cannot change. We can only try to control or wrestle control over how we handle it. I'm not you and I'm not your doctor (not that you agree with your doctor at the moment) but I really believe in the downside potential in using benzos. Hell, people talk about downside potential in taking Subs yet I do so because I feel that the risk of having a hard time getting off was worth it in order to have a chance at breaking the cycle.


&nbsp;

Knowing how my snottier friends would act, I've avoided sharing anything with any of them about my addiction. Some of them know or heard rumors, that's how I had to deal with a failed intervention in July of 2017. I bullshitted my way out of it and took another year before I switched completely to subs. 


&nbsp;

One times I saw one of my better "smart" childhood friends and he seemed to be genuinely concerned for my well being, it's like I could see it in his eyes or something... that he heard shit about me and heroin. Another too who was buying stuff at my job. Both cases I was able to reasonably assure them or give a solid appearance of well being. Especially now, as I get into an expensive hobby like astrophotography -- how could I be an addict? It's sort of like how I said "how can I be an addict, I would have sold this stack of laptops if I was."

&nbsp;


With regards to not wanting to be treated like a junky; Cliff's brother has his suspicions about me being a junky but I denied it. I will not open up to him because of the time I took acid and watched Iron Man II with him. He fucking told one or two of our "straight-edge" friends for whatever reason. So one day I'm in the Vitamin Shoppe and an old friend who ultimately became a cop recently, he was like "I heard you did acid" in a fucking smug ass lame ass tone. 

&nbsp;


Of course I asked, "where did you hear about that?" His response: "the grapevine." That motherfucking chicken shit, if you got the balls to fucking tell me you know I did some acid have the goddam balls to tell me how you fucking know. I can figure it out anyway and I'm not gonna go and do something about it either way. Except maybe speak to the source and be like "dude, why'd you tell that friend about that? I'd like to keep that shit private because people go on tangents and spread gossip." I don't like when people hear something and share their judgemental tone. Do on to others as you would like them to do on to you.

&nbsp;



I hope something in here serves as food for thought or helps in some way through relatability.Yep, and that is why recovery is so fucking hard. But you have to find a way to incorporate fulfillment into your life. We could probably fix a lot of social problems if we fixed a lot of social problems, hahaha"Do you miss doing dope"  -     "Do you miss having sex with beautiful women" or "Do you miss eating delicious food"You ever shoot up after scoring before you drive home? Then you are potentially affecting other people in a bad way, or will eventually.Yo bro,i feel the same way but i have a fiery vengeance in me to want to tear down the man made conditions setup which funnel us into drug use. I have a picture in my head and i know it is real and it is a world where people dont willingly commit slow suicide by drugs or any othet method to drown out whatever static noise is being shoved in faster than i can shovel out. People ARE to blame for this mess. 

I watched my dad self medicate with alcohol and anger my whole life and i thought i was smarter, but look at the path i chose. I dont even hate him for it out of thr moment, how could i. Just trying to copeIt’s ironic you brought up sarcasm after he used /s

:p[deleted]bruuuhh that shit wildI feel good from opiates, but the kind of high you are describing... I feel better from that. Thank you for taking the time for this reply man, I really appreciate it. I just used the last of my oxy, and probably won't be able to get any forever or a very long time, so I suppose today is the first day of recovery again. I'm gonna try doing some physical activity, maybe just a dog walk to start, but something is better than nothing. Hopefully I can be happy without drugs some day. 

&#x200B;

Thank you again for this reply man <3Definitely not by incorporating the corporate lifestyle though.Tim who asks that question about dope, I asked him if he had any loss in sex-drive and he said yes. However, his sex drive is fucking strong --- strong enough that he goes to brothels every week behind his wife's back. A man without a sex drive doesn't need to spend money on sex, unless that's just his form of masturbation and he just does pays professionals to do it for him.

&#x200B;

I do enjoy delicious food and having to  worry about obtaining dope. Really just glad not to have to deal with middles like Derrick who say they will be confidential but open their big mouth the instant it benefits them for any reason.[deleted]yeah I want to change this dumbass society too but what can we do?

I work in a school, I always tell the students do not vote for the mainstream parties (UK here), and if you do, you have no right to complain about the State as you are a direct cause of it. Luckily despite the Teen stereotype a lot of them are not stupid, plus they have access to the 'Net so they know the score. I show them the websites that list the sleaze all of our supposed "betters" (politicians etc) get upto over here (the anti-drug, church going Member of Parliament who was caught doing a line of cocaine off of a young teenage boys chest...) We have the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. You can pretend that it's fine and reasonable to ignore th overwhelming evidence against it all you want, just tricking yourselves. and it's not really up for debate lmao. Any religious person is a moron.Unless you're willing to drink the coolaid and feel at home in the company's hermetic office environment. Still, they'll kick anyone out on their ass once they become more trouble than they're worth. Offering golden parachutes to those higher up in the caste, using HR to cover their asses legally when they feel that someone needs to be "let go." yea man if I want to do some opiates after work, then who is anyone to tell me I can't?  Because I could potentially affect someone in a bad way?

So by that logic then fatties should all be put into work camps until they weigh a healthy weight, because they also affect others in a bad way by causing global warming?  

Should we all be a Master Race of people who are 100% healthy? Should we be forced this way against our will?  (currently over here our Elites are trying to force us all to be a non smoking, non drinking, perfectly healthy Master Race. Meanwhile these Elites are all fat, drinking, drug taking, lazy wastes of space - but it is not about our health. It is about us taking less sick days and working harder for them.)[deleted]That's another point really, the fact that we are at the loose end of the stick, and that they couldn't care less about anyone below themselves. Thus why bother doing anything for them assholes, other than the bare minimum to keep collecting your pay check.My evidence would be what god would create and allow such a terrible existence?

If there were an all powerful god, and he created everything, including all the evil shit, then he is a fucking asshole dick cunt fucker.

I hope you’ll respond. You can't be serious.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: hmm, Content: , ups: 1123, downs: 0Made me laugh dopesick as fuck. Take your upvote.I actually tested positive for opiates on a Drug test recently by eating an everything bagel the morning of the test. My probation officer didn't believe me, of course lolLololIt’s always the fckn bagel.Damn poppy seed bagels get you every timeOk.... this one was goodOk you made me laugh and i woke up and pissed my dog off.  He’s giving me the ol’ stink eye. He’lol pass back out soon though lol. LolThings that make ya go ¿QUE? Also you shouldn’t  be smoking babies. No, you should snort babies the high is cleaner.i knew those everything bagels had some jizz on em“......shouldn’t a got that butter AND cream cheese.”Ahh all those people who don’t read twitter probably think you thought this up :-)

Do you have any more gems from other people’s twitter accounts?u/CockRaterGirlWow laughing whilst sick. You must of found this unearthly hilarious. Hope the sickness will be taking care of, the impending sickness for me is right around the bend,fucking again ��I had a very faint positive at the methadone clinic. I was so confused and I was swearing up and down that I didn't touch anything because I hadn't taken anything in over 3 years at that point but they probably hear that all the time.

I realized I ate the everything bagel the night before and that morning and she said she believed me but I still told them to send it to get tested and I came back that afternoon to sample again and it was negative. I was always told it was a myth. Didn't they disprove this on mythbusters?Good luck finding crushable babies anymore.Damn, don't you hate it when you eat jizz and get pregernante?uh what LolI would rather be mildly high and staring down the barrel of a five day withdrawal than sober, which I currently amSry to hear fellow. Love your name, Ruby is da shit, hope you get well soon bro! Late reply, but is your name a $B reference?Nah, they proved that it happens. Just employer drug tests usually Bing at a higher point than government ones because they know small things like that can set a test off. I heard putting them in the microwave helps. You can still find them in Canada. i hate when i have my everything bagel and get the preggers :( Idk man I def don't miss the days of constantly being on the edge of withdrawal not even being able to get high anymore with shitty tar just using to not be sick. But it's such a nice day. Yupyupp
Ahhh got it. Good to knowOr dissolving them in coca colaThats where im at The more you know. And knowing is half the battle. And knowing is half the bagel @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Always some long drawn out process, Content: , ups: 1079, downs: 0[deleted]Oh god, this reminds me of one time my dealer and her boyfriend (who was the real dealer, she was more the middle i guess) arguing in front of me and him shouting about her selling to junkies as I’m standing there so fucking uncomfortable. Dude ended up feeling bad for saying that and threw me like 3 extra pills but Jesus if I didn’t want to just disappear at that moment!! �� in the 80s a guy offered me all the coke i wanted if i "JUST DONT LEAVE"

talk about a dilemma, listen to his shit for the next 24 hours doing unlimited coke or dip out with a gram for $80Why are they beefing? Explain the trouble in paradise.Ha. Makes me appreciate my guy. Car only 5 min max. One of my guys does this shit but is really cool and fast if he sees youre in wd. Real mvp that guy. Hey man dealers got feelings tooThis is why I always did a bag right before heading out to cop. My buddy would be sweating bc he did the wake up bag last night lol[Free R Kelly!](https://youtu.be/HiIla9Mqo1I) This is incredible [removed]Isn’t this photo shopped? No it's on purpose, otherwise kid be out and never listen to there bullishThen does he get all pissed off when you suggest hurrying it up? It's like they have zero self awareness. Either that or they get some fucked up satisfaction out of screwing people around in stupid petty ways. The good dealers make so much more not fucking around. Probably also don't get popped over super petty shit or at least not as often.When I was a benzo junkie my guy would forget where he left his bars all the fucking time since he was a bar head too, even though he had huge bags of literally hundreds (probably thousands). It’d always be in some dumb spot like behind the detergent in the laundry room or in one of the kitchen cabinets. Once he left them at a barber shop and he made me drive him up there (he said he’d throw me 20) and there was a ziplock bag of at least 500 double stacks still on the counter where he cut his hair and nobody fucking noticed, not even the bar heads who work there. One guy I know is lonely af and has no friends so he’ll sit there and talk to you for a fucking hour. It’s so annoying A dope dealer that was upset about junkies wanting dope?  Wtaf �So what did you do?This is the R Kelly interview on CBSAs I understand it, they're not. This was just an interview on CBS that got a bit heated and emotional. Props to the interviewer though, she stayed totally calm and chill while he was freaking the f out. Franco- "Hey, you ever think you could like pull the plug on someone? Hypothetically I mean"
Rogen- "What!? Y-ymean like on her? I dunno man I don't got a lot of time, I got to go to my girlfriend's dinner and shit I... I could go on all day about... euthanasia."My dude lives in the same apt complex so delivers to my door. So even it im waiting it's in my bedBoondocks did it.?Oh I'm sure the power goes to many of their heads. I had a guy who did that kind of shit on purpose. For opsec purposes he would refuse to meet up (used bitcoin for payment) and would drop off the product at some random location where you'd have to go and pick it up. Honestly, I'd prefer some annoying conversation than having to go fish under a toilet at a bar.It's for security purposes too. Can't have people heading in and out within minutes.This who tf else does he expect to sell too? Kindergarten teachers and zen monks?Lied and said i had to go home and take a shower, that id be back but i never came back.

the sad thing is ive met others who were scared to death to be alone .   They werent all on drugs. One guy was filthy rich and just couldnt stand not to have a crowd around at all times.

even if they were tearing up his shit and trashing his place and taking advantage of him and borrowing money ect...I wish R. Kelly would go away (and take the Trumps with him).

TO SLOVENIA!!!

*snapping a whip*A lot of black ghetto plugs are racist as fuck and get a kick out of fucking around with white customers, especially if they look wealthier or like timid college kids. Or they will make power moves or requests, then laugh about the "fucking wyt boi" they just got to drive them around. They get off on the feeling they have power over those they see as having a better life than them, a lot absolutely despise junkies too.

&#x200B;

A lot of the white plugs especially the older ones are the "I'm lonely" type, or they are also junkies serving to support their habit and want you to use with them so they feel like less of a junkie somehow or listen to their life story and play therapist and other kinds of nonsense.That dude sounds paro, but I bet he hasn’t gotten caught.  Why would he put it under the toilet in a bar? A place with cameras? Shitty opsec right there.Fr I’m fucking done ��Comedy goldSounds like jessie from breaking bad Damn. Seems like a tweakers dreamI've only ever had hood connects in 11 years and have never experienced what you're talking about. One of my guys actually called and apologized for being an angry asshole to my girl and I. Everyone's different. I can certainly say I've ran into the 2nd. I've never really dealt with many black folks and the ones I have dealt with have been really cool except 1 experience.

The lonely type that will front just to have somebody to talk to. When I was younger in my early 20s I had an older dealer in his mid 40s. When me and my friends would stop by he would think of the situation as more of a hangout than a sell. I think he was trying to re live his younger days. He would talk and talk and it was so hard to get away. Especially when you're sick and just want the shot asap. A few moments I'm not proud of are the times I sat over there just to get free dope. He would also front just to have somebody to talk to lol I felt bad for him.99% of their sales are on the Dark Web where they're a big vendor. This was just a favor they did for me.It was dumb as fuck. But I didn't know anyone else. He mostly sold online and I figured  out he was in my city so I asked if he'd do something direct. So it wasn't like he had a bunch of people going into a bar's bathroom and then leaving. And it was a different place every time, which made it very annoying. But when you're a junkie and you're desperate...almost forgot about that,,,,,,bb always portraying realness in the show ,good team of writers....that part in the series is soo depressing, when he's just zombies out with the big speakers always playing, and the roomba lolI once had a dealer ask me to meet him at a convenience store, probably the worst place to meet for a drug deal. Then when we both got there, a cop was outside. So he motions to me to follow him into the store where I hand him the cash as we walk in. Rather than just hand me my satchel, he tosses the bag on the store shelf in front of 3 employees. What a god damned moron. Now what, I’m supposed to take something off a store shelf and put it into my pocket, looking like a thief with a cop right out side.... *sigh* @@@@@@@@@@ Title: A couple of years ago she saved my life. I was nodding out on benzos and opiates super hard and started to choke on my tongue because I was lying on my back. She jumped on my stomach which caused me to sit up. I owe her a lot., Content: , ups: 1060, downs: 0Narcat?Absolute hero cat. She wanted to make sure you'd still be around to feed her, servant. Did you name her narcan?Believe it or not cats have super senses and can sense things people can't there are cats that know when their owner has cancer before they or anyone else even does.Good Kittyshes a cutie :)This is amazing ❤️❤️❤️. Sorry to hear about you possibly almost loosing your life but I'm glad your furbaby saved you!!Good kittySome cats can be really good kids.You cant swallow your own tongue.  So I'm calling bullshit also.  We get it. You vapeIs your cat part Russian blue? She looks very similar. We have one as well. Best cat ever. The real og Are u still using eitherThose Russian blues always have a resting bitch face. Russian blues every one I’ve know has been crazy expect for one who was just mean because he was old and had health issues to where he couldn’t clean so he had dreads on his back. My dad had one that lived to be 19 and only died because he got into a fight with another cat one night when we let him out to dick around in the garden in the front. His tooth broke off in that fight and it got infected which killed him he was too old to fight it off :(. Was one of the few times I saw my dad cry, it was his cat while he was in college. My cat died 2 years ago one that I had since I was 8 and lived with me when I got my own place at 22, I cried like a bitch for weeks, it was hard watching him go down and slowly die over his last year of life but he was extremely sweet and loving that last year. He was such a badass cat, I don’t know if I’ll ever have a cat like him. He did not act like a cat his personality was more like a human. I almost nodded off to my death due to a combination of opiates and benzos in my car but was saved by a stranger who screamed "fuckin junkie!" Honestly, that person unknowingly changed my life greatly; the crazy thing about that event was the comment wasn't even aimed towards me..�����Ohhhh whatta cutie, and so erm...well fed �[deleted]It's not actually possible to choke on your tongue. Source: I used to lifeguard and I took multiple CPR/rescue breathing classes.Crazy how our furry friends have our backs! I passed out on bars and Roxies too and my little guy was scratching at my chest so hard he broke the zipper off the jacket I was wearing at the time! Funny because it didn't wake me up, but when I woke up the next morning you can imagine the level of confusion I experienced when looking down at my jacket....lolI call bull lol sorry broI thought the same thing, then saw you posted if too!! LolLegit name �Never fear Narcat is here!!We need super cats with narcan claws to chill with while noddingAin’t that the truthNarcat I wouldn't call it super senses. Both cats and dogs have a far superior sense of smell and hearing. 

We generally don't realise that, but our body odour changes a lot depending on our physical condition. Both dogs and cats can be trained to warn a diabetic owner of a low blood sugar situation or an epileptic seizure. Dogs have an advantage here due to how much easier it is to train them. Also dogs have evolved to be vety good at reading human emotions. So a trained service dog can anticipate panic attacks or otherwise comfort an unstable person.

Long story short, it's not super senses, it's that the human that feeds them and cares for them suddenly smells and sounds differently. And that's a cause for concern.My cat used to lay on my chest for hours licking my face when I was using. Though she maybe just couldn't resist tasting me while waiting for the inevitable overdose to start devouring me. They do! My sisters cat knew I was in labor before I knew. She even followed me into the shower meowing at me. I was so confused until I felt it. Cats will also eat their owners eye balls after a couple hours dead where as dogs will start starve to death before considering eating their human 

Source: am dog guySuper sensesThere was one time she shit in my bathtub, then threw up on the carpet. But for the most part 10/10 So I googled that, turns out you’re right. So I’d have to assume either my throat relaxed to the point it restricted my airway, or I was choking on my saliva Bro you wanna see a smoke ring bro? Bro I’m wicked good at vape tricks bro She’s a dilute tortoiseshell

[She has very unique colouring ](https://imgur.com/a/evpmF0o) No, I’m on subs now since the start of this year Back off, The vet says she’s a very healthy weight :p



It’s gross, but you’re not wrong Cats are better than you’ll ever be, you probably think humans are better than animals. Yea it’s already been established elsewhere in the comments Ive seen a post and thought of a pun then gone to post it only to find somone beat me to it many a time ahaAm willing to invest in this project.Even better lolI’m type 1 diabetic funny enough. I knew someone with a blood sugar dog when I was younger, they’re goddamn amazing In a way, you are calling it a super sense though - superior (super) sense of smell.Dogs eventually will eat their owners too if they’re stuck with their owner’s body and have nothing else to eat! Dogs just wait a little bit longer than cats do to start.... probably because they’re so much slower than cats. Hehe.A couple of hours? I'm pretty sure it's more like after a week and the cat is starving to death.Go lick your dogs asshole My turtle doesn't think twice about shitting in the bath tub. I think it's automatic for them.

As for puking, my friend has a cat who usually pukes after eating leaves off of the house plants.Probably just had your throat in a restricted position that made everything feel compressed. Only way you can swallow your own tongue is to cut it loose from the bottom of your mouth first. 

Edit: perhaps you have sleep apnea that you only noticed when you were half-conscious and nodding out. Sleep apnea is a condition where as you sleep you’ll randomly stop breathing throughout the night, and it can sometimes feel like you’re choking. It has varying degrees of severeness, but it could be life threatening if left unchecked. Maybe go to a sleep clinic and have a sleep study done if you think that could’ve been what happened.  Bro fr bro? That’s wild broI wanna see tricks!!OP she's a real pretty one. I have a male cat that looks exactly like her!!!

More pics! I'll send you pics of mine if you'd like to see her twin hahaha.Congrats man Gotta love comments like these. How much do you hate humans? Look, the only reason why there is such a thing as "don't treat animals poorly" is because you are a human with a developed sense of what is right. There is currently nothing else in this universe that we're aware of that uses any kind of moral aside from instinct. Everytime you try to denounce human kindness, remember that a human just spoke those words. Not saying humans are superior, but we are the only ones even making this distinction[deleted][deleted][deleted]Right? Now I just look like a copy cat :( 

Couldn’t help myself. Reddit likes puns. It will save lives and cats. Its got no downsides. Someone $$$ invest asap into r&dit‘s all just words anyways, one can call it chubbahibbadub, doesn‘t change the awesomeness lolHehe good pointGoogle.. The truth is out there. I'm sure it varies, but at the end of the day you just never know if you and the kitty kat had this super epic soul mate relationship or if it just tolerating you and slowly bending you to do their will IMO Did you come here just to stick up for cats. It's a fucking joke based on facts so I think there is probably a much better chance that you are in fact the feline cunnilingus champion here. Live a very long and happy life fellow animal lover.You might want to tell your friend to be careful with their cat. Like dogs, cats will eat greenery to cause them to vomit, like a weird cleanse.

However some plants are poisonous to cats and by eating them, your friend’s cat could be getting sick and that’s why it’s vomiting.  I know for sure I don’t have apnea, this was the only incident I had experienced chocking on nothing. After this I wouldn’t lie down if I was nodding and I started to sleep on my side just for safety. 

It is totally possible that as I was nodding out I moved my head in a way that restricted my airway. Again I was lucky this was the only incident i had chocking Bro fr. I got mad sponsors bro you don’t find talent like mine very often bro I’d love too! I see other grey cats, but very few have the same colouring as mine, I don’t think she’s like a super valuable type of breed or anything, but I think her coat colouring is pretty rare 

So I’d love too see some look alikes :)Thanks, appreciate it I hate humans a lot actually & that’s not gonna change. I understand what you’ve written here but I’m confused about the point your trying to make, are you saying we shouldn’t care to treat animals & plants for that matter with respect because they can’t make the distinction ? Honestly you don't.  You rely on millions of humans keeping society together everyday.  You don't value dogs over humans, you take for granted humans.  You may value dogs personal company over humans.Lol so you would swerve out of the road for a dog and not a human? Nice broDamn, I really wish people like you could see how much my cat loves people & how excited he gets when we come home. What your saying is partly true but is way generalized, this dog or cat person thing actually has a lot of psychology behind it IMO, but ALL animals deserve to be respected & loved unconditionally because they serve a purpose far more wholesome than any human being ever could as all we do is hurt and destroy this planet. The UK actually did a study on this (surprising I know lol)  they found that the dogs waited a day longer than the cats but BOTH ate their dead owners. Hell, if I was locked in with no food supply, I’d eat you too… prob sooner than dogs and cats. Yeah actually you are an asshole because you used “kys”, I’m not gonna tell strangers to kill themselves. Like I said there’s a lot of psychology behind this animal preference & what I’m seeing is that happier people like dogs & more emotional or sad folks like cats. But the bottom line is I don’t want people treating animals poorly because the internet seems to always favor dogs under the premise of your “joke” about them eating their owners eyeballs after they pass or whatever. They’re animals & they have instincts. Personally I don’t give a damn if an animal was to eat me, at least then we served as some kind of actual purpose. Nah i feel ya. Its the first time ive gotten in on time ahaJesus your not wrong look at all those upvotes ahahahahIt would be kind of a downside if you’re just chilling and your cat scratches you playfully and you’re thrown into PWD.I'm not a cat person so I wouldn't be surprised either way. Owners do nothing but provide their cats with food... Even in death.feline cunnilingus = pussy eater.  HUR HUR.

Source: Am a cunning linguist and a master debater.[deleted]I’ve woken up choking on my own spit before like to the point to where I jumped up knocking shit all off of my counter freaking out trying to breath, my nose my stopped up to but eventually got a few breaths in through my nose enough to calm down and clear my throat shit was scary lolNo, I guess I didn't really explain my point now that I see it. I'm sry, english isn't my native language. I agree that we should treat all animals with respect, infact that's why I wrote this entire thing hahaha. I instantly felt like you were the type of guy to say you hate humans. Of course, I'm not expecting you to change opinions just because a stranger on the internet tells you to. I just find it sad to see people hate on humans that much, when the concept of good and evil itself was made by us. The fact that you are putting animals above yourself and want to protect them that dearly, even though it gives you no benefit, proofs that humans are the only ones to bring kindness and mercy to this world. A dog cannot understand a concept as complicated as that, he just really really likes you. I think we have an obligation to protect less developed animals. That's why I tryed to at least explain my view, because a lot of people seem to forget that they are humans themselves.

sry for the giant essay, have a nice day :) [deleted]I think the “copy cat” part was another pun-type joke to continue on the cat* trend since he missed his first shot. Sorry for the mini r/whooosh (always forget, 2 or 3 o’s)

Edit: *cat not carNot wrongGee, that got out of hand pretty fast. It's true tho, dogs are loyal AF and usually won't eat their owners. It's a somber beautiful thing to see a dog moaning next to his or her dead keeper.

I still might trust a cat more than a yorkie tho.
what a cunt you are[deleted]I completely understand what your saying friend and your English is A okay� no need to apologize for anything at all, but one thing I want to say is there is a major benefit from caring for these helpless plants & animals, at least for me there is. Nothing brings me more joy to be honest. Your despicable, why do you insist on trying to argue that cats are soulless. My cat literally runs around the fucking house & starts playing with all his toys and even dropping them at my feet wanting to play as soon as I walk in. Did you have a bad experience with felines growing up or something?! I don’t get why your so hung up on this, cats are amazing creatures that show us the same level of affection that we show them, if they were so terrible we wouldn’t be keeping them as pets since the beginning of human civilization. Defs a whooosh moment ahahaha“Come here buddy, who’s my cute little guyyy-OH FUCK, just kill me now!”.[deleted]that's because you're a good person :) [deleted]It’s ok cause I think he had a whooosh moment as well and completely missed that you missed his joke.[deleted]That would be so fucking shit cool. Really shitty too, but hey at least there's recycling going on.I appreciate that, hope you have a great day. I’ll help with your legit confusion then. Do you know what role plants play on this earth? Everything we eat, all our drugs, our clean air all come from Plants that are raped and abused. They just like animals are living and don’t have a way to fend for themselves against the greed of human beings tearing them down, controlling them or completely wiping them out without a care. So yes I consider them helpless, care to argue about this matter more? Ever heard of mass deforestation? Wtf I upvoted you and you're only back to 1, your post was hilariousIt’s gonna be the new diet trend. Will be started by Extreme liberal Vegans who begin to realize that eating plants is still killing/eating life and recycle to save the planet yo! Are you a vegetarian?  I hate people too.[deleted][deleted][deleted]tbh it's sad people think about plants the way they do. sure they can't express themselves, doesen't mean you don't have to look after them Don’t own a home & don’t have a lawn but if it was up to me I wouldn’t mow it. I don’t even smoke pot dude, just cause I give a fuck about the planet doesn’t mean I’m stoned & if being stoned makes you care about the things you should care for then maybe you should be smoking. Also don’t own anything made of leather or fur.

&#x200B;That’s cool. You look so young dude. Well done ��Keep up the good work.  And, as my psychiatrist tells me, *remember where you came from.*Left pic. �Wow I can’t believe that’s the same person! Congratulations. Remember, if you ever consider doing it “just one time” it will turn into “just weekends” then it will be a full blown relapse. My friend went 3 years clean and then about 5 months ago he got offered a single 4 milligram dilaudid, he said “fuck it I’ll do just this one pill and then that’s it, no more”. He’s now dope sick 3 days a week and going back to methadone clinic any day now. Anyways good job random person!! I’m 3 weeks clean now I hope I make it to 9 months like you!U look beautiful no matter what but def can see the different i assume u got clean? It looks goodCongrats, Ive been off the dope for a year and a half now, it's crazy how quickly things can changeAnd here I am just popped oxy for the first time ever. Waiting for it to hit.. Congratulations and you look great in both pics honestlyWay to go, girl. Proud of you. Am I the only one who likes the left one more? :D (only talking about the pictures)Happy for you! But you look pretty healthy on both pictures. I think if you would laugh on the first picture too, there wouldn't be a huge difference :)You look good in both tbh just dressed differently. Congrats on getting clean. Damn, if that ain't encouraging! Thanks for the motivation!If there's anything I've learned about addiction (especially to opiates), it'll steal your soul if you're not careful.  Meth will compromise your dopamjne reward pathways and rewire the way you think in a bad way. Plus it's cardiotoxic af, I'm thankful I never got TOO fucked up in the head after a year of doing meth IV.  Nowadays I just blow tree, take Adderall every now and take Xanax/kpins for anxiety. Anyway, congrats man that's a big milestone. You have my support �✌️What was your DOC? Aw, what a huge difference! And what a huge victory!! Keep going girl, you got this. Don't know you but am proud of you. �❤Awesome way to go and that's an amazing change! Always inspiring to see others making it happen one day at a time!r/gonesober candidate.What a difference. Congratulations!are you on any replacement drugs like suboxone?  that’s what i’m on now. only that. i just picked up my script actually. i know i’m not fully clean while on it, but at least i’m not acting all pathetic anymore. lol[deleted]Agent Scully?You look fantastic!!! ❤️❤️❤️Wow
Great work! The difference is astounding! 
Keep being strong! :)Wow! You’re beautiful � 4 months clean here. Keep it up!Congrats girl! I know how hard it is✌� much respect ; i wonder how does it feel to be reborn, to be back in life and reality again, they say the eyes are windows to the soul and i see a beautiful , unchained free spirit ✌�I'd tap datYou're really strong for making it out. Im so glad to see that your happy now too. Thanks for sharing.So pretty! You can see the difference. Great job. Get yourself a good milkshake or something that's a treat and celebrate. You deserve it. And your inspiring. Congrats.Will you marry me?  So beautiful.19 and addicted to oxy (with fent) over here. This is motivating and comforting to me knowing there’s still time to change.Tbh the doped out looks better.Looking cute AF in the right hand pic...great job congratsGirl on the left I'd run with for a while and ruin her life.

Girl on the right, too intimidating, haha.  Congrats on your sobriety.Wow,  you're looking so much healthier.  Beautiful girl either way.   Congratulations,  lotta hard work and dedication!  Keep up the good work! Wow you look like a completely different person. Sobriety looks good on you. Just celebrated 30 months clean myself. My transformation wasn’t as drastic lol.  Keep it up. It only gets easier. I'm gonna take a verbal dump because I'm in the middle of my addictions and I'm fucking miserable.

Do I think there's a genuine, no-relapse risk way out of addiction? Of course there is, but our society doesnt want to practice it. People become so scared of drugs and addiction that they take over your decisions completely, prohibiting the extremely critical trial and error you need to experience to recover. 


Either that, or they go with the other toxic extreme by completely ostracizing you from their lives, making you a complete outcast unworthy of a basic human relationship.

Now you, you are an attractive girl and as such you probably experienced the former, where your family and friends step in and say whatever they need to say to convince you you aren't well and need to turn yourself over to them (and the medical professionals who aim to make thousands off of you). You'll inevitably crack under the pressure since you're not really happy with yourself, submitting to whatever they want to do with you.

You'll go to rehab and they'll detox you and let you spill your feelings in a bunch of group therapies. Those therapies will be a bunch of addicts in denial about drugs, silenced by the counselors. The counselors will try to brainwash the prohibition standpoint and they'll hope you'll come out of there with the idea that you're not allowed to use drugs ever.

Time will pass and people will commend you for your sobriety. You'll slowly start to realize that you're doing this for other people and not yourself.

That voice in your head was never silenced because other people have forced sobriety on you rather than you enduring trial and error like you should have. One day that voice in your head will make you crack, and you'll go use again and you may or may not overdose.

You fall into the same cycle for a while and someone will find out, subsequently break the trial and error process you need to experience to recover and try and force sobriety on you. And you'll probably submit because - again you're a pretty girl and you've got the works in society for support.

The only true way out of addiction is to use and use and use again until you are so sick of it, even the worst suffering doesnt deter you from sobriety. You and only you can decide to stop and any attempt at being stopped by others is a quick road to relapse and overdose. /endrant


Go ahead, white knights, do your fucking worst in defense.Man filters do wondersIs this where I get in line to compliment some fishing for said compliments?

These posts are as cringy as the "look at my pupils I'm so faded lolz" posts.The difference is crazy !

I started young too, glad we didn't lose more of our lives...5 months clean myself! Congratulations ���Absolutely incredible, what a beautiful transformation. Truly inspiring, the difference in the 2 pictures is staggering. Never forget how far youve come. This post made me happy, thank you!How old are you? Asking because your head/face seems to have really evolved and it cant all be down to addiction right? Anyways keep it up. Looking great! ��� I'm glad you got through it! I've lost many due to opioids and I've seen a few clean up and I am more proud of them than everif that flag on your wall is the state your in then congrats fellow nutmeggerAm i gunna have to be the only one addressing the elephant in the room? The pic on the left is way, way hotter lol.You look a bit like Billie Eilish on the pic on the left. I'm just 3 months sober, and it feels great. People out there need to know that you can get better, but you need help. Please look into rehab, and recovery places. Don't wait until it's too late, or you're forced to do it. And make sure you are doing it for yourself![**r/whiteknighting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiteknighting/)I'm so happy for you, sweetie. I'm a grandma, and I'd give you a great big grandma hug if I could. 

I am not educated about eating disorders other than what the average person reads and learns, but I've lived 6 decades now, and I've seen how women distort their physical traits and focus on them. I've watched as we've gone from a society that was, in the 70s, telling women to think of themselves as more than a sexual partner for the pleasure of men to the present where we tell women how strong and capable they are, while writing articles in women's magazines about how to sexual appeal to others....and ads in those magazines featuring airbrushed thin and flawless bodies. I was enjoying happy hour recently in a very trendy and popular place, and I noticed the rap song playing was talking about women in the most insulting and sexually repressive ways. Around me were young women moving to the music and singing along. I can't express how screwed up all this is, and the damage it does to a woman if they let any of this in. 

All that to say....be realistic with yourself about what a woman's body should look like. Be different from what society is telling you.....the mixed signals are out there, and they have no business even being allowed into your space....you are way too good for that. Fight for you, your body and your health. Don't ever give in. If you can accomplish what you have already, you can challenge the dysfunctional and skewed thinking about your body that comes from both within and without. 

I want you to live to be a grandma. Despite the struggles along the way, it's just the most fantastic thing in the world to march into the next decade of your life, over and over again. Do it like you mean it. And I promise you, a normal aging imperfect body will be your best friend and take you everywhere you want to go.how did you do it? i need help!Em fee ee4leeeeeeeell lleellelleelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellleellelelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleellleelleelleelleellellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllrlYou look pretty in both pictures, but sooo much healthier and happier in the second one! I hope you're able to keep it up, girly! Great work, it's inspiring!What was your motivation to quit?/ why u quit?Love cures all things, was your libido also nonexistent with opioids? 

I’m a guy and on Kratom I look at hot girls with same desire as car.Wow what a transformation, you look great!You are amazing. Keep up the effort, it shows![deleted]Congrats!! It’s amazing what sobriety can do! I’m about 4 and half years now and it gets better and better everyday!! Keep it up ❤️Yeah!! You get it, girl! Congratulations![deleted]Damn you look strong, I am not even addicted to drugs but I struggle with my addictions still (video games and porn mainly). I don't know what would I have done if I was in your shoes because I can't even quit these addictions they are nothing like heroin or meth, my mind tricks me and tells me that I'd ratger die than quit these... I am trying to moderate them at the moment, hopefully it will work this time. Good for you on getting clean OP, I feel happy for you and sending you positive vibes!!!You are the type of people I look upto and think there's still hope. If people can beat opiate addiction then I think I too can bring myself and my life together for better.Yeah but how about without a filterGlow up �Congratulations!! Looks like you’re killing it!!! Sending so much positivity your way!I believe you have a doppelgänger running around ohio. Wow, you look amazing,congratulations! WowwwRighteous moo cow you look crazy good. Beautiful girl good for you ���Thanks. I think ima do the same thing as u when i get off suboxone. kratom is a really cool herb. u might wanna stock up on a lot of them tho to be safe, cuz who knows how long the government will let it stay legal. i know it’s stupid, but kratom doesn’t make them any money so it will probably become scheduled one day. Congrats. You look great. Great! So happy for you, looks like two completely different ladies. It is, of course. You're a beautiful person with a lot of life in front of you, may it be a beautiful future. Continued strength and focus to you!!!You’re are too young to trash your life away. Huge props. Keep it up, you look great. Damn girl.  You lookin cooler than the other side of the pillow.  Keep that shit up.[deleted]Omg you are so tiny! I'm jealous... I'm the same height as you. I'm a year clean and I gained like 15 pounds. I'm now 135 and I hate it. At my lowest in my addiction,  I was 105 and people said I looked horrible and disgusting because I was so thin. But I secretly loved it lol. ❤️ Good luck to you! Any secrets on losing the weight?? awesome awesome � one day at time girl, congrats�Congrats on making it this far. You look vibrant and happy. Like truly happy. Something about you gives off this “I’m a good person” vibe which is dope to see. I usually have a good eye for that. 

Rock on, and again, props. Keep doing what got you to right now. I'm not on Reddit often at all these days, but will look at my feed once in a while randomly.. this post makes me glad that I did!!! Currently in the thick of things but have been wanting to get out, & your post (and others like it) are so motivating & inspiring.. hopeful. It's so easy to fall into that negative thinking, that it can't be done, that everyone fails... It's inspiring to be reminded that that's not always how it goes & success IS possible! Fear is the main thing that keeps me stuck where I'm at, and seeing the difference in people who have made that leap really helps me to feel less afraid! I had 2 years at one point & it was the happiest I've ever been, you've reminded me of that! Thank you, & congratulations! Ur actually so hot in the pic on the left idk whyIsn’t funny how ya get hot once clean? I swear I made a full 180 in terms of looks. Once you start showering daily again and eating right it puts the life right back in ya?! Looking great! You are lovely!!! It looks like your soul is gone in the picture on the left. Some people say addiction steals souls and addicts are not happy. I beg to differ with that statement whereas each person handles their addiction or vices differently. I know many happy functioning addicts and I also know many miserable addicts. But the picture on the right you have a glow back in your eyes and that smile...wow!!! I don’t usually creep on people or comment on strangers pictures cause it’s sort of creepy in my eyes, but this is an exception! You just look so damn happy and full of life again!!! I hope you beat your eating disorder next, I have a cousin who suffers from body dysmorphia and hates the way she looks etc when in all reality she shouldn’t be ashamed of her looks (no creeps I’m not saying I think my cousin is hot!!!) however she is not ugly or need to be ashamed of her looks, and you TOTALLY should not be ashamed of your weight or looks either. You are beautiful and very well spoken from your posts! I hope you have found happiness other than at the bottom of a bottle or chasing your next fix....hopefully someday soon I can find happiness outside of pills and h congrats dude ! I'd bang em both.Your pupils arent pinned or anywhere near small in the old pic. You must not have been on opiates when that pic was taken.

Just somethin i noticed. Maybe thats the cause of the unhappy lookWhat's the dirtiest thing you've ever had to do for drug money?You look better hooked on smack, just sayin'diesbt seen kuje the same oersinDo they keep girls like you at na? I need to get out more! Congratulations on your sobriety, I too am sober and life is getting better.Are you really the same girl? When you was hooked, physically you still been so much pretty
:)  And first of all, congratulations in first place for 1 year sober, that is a really hard work. From junkie to preppie! Seriously though, you look great though keep up the good work!damn girl your looking really good!You look better in the first pic lol Idk I guess I'm biased cuz ur more my type in the first oneMan I always think the addicts are gorgeous, don't get me wrong I think you're looking a lot healthier but I always fall for the girls on the left.The one on the right is while on opiates, correct?Why do I like you more on the leftHaha sorry I know that’s fucked upNow this is what I call beautiful �❤Congratulations you look amazing You put on weight. Keep up the good work. Wanna make out?I’d make sober love to you babygirl ��Just about! Just hit 9 months clean today and 11 months sober from alcohol :)I couldn't be happier :) just gotta get my eating disorder under control and I'm golden ❤️Thank you!!❤️True.You're an inspiration and should be very proud of yourself! Stunning and the difference is astonishing. Less than a year! I respect the self-control and commitment to yourself to make things better. Looks like everything's coming up great. Never stop, never stopping! � Love these before and after pics, can see the life in people's eyes again. Sending positive vibes your way still, stay healthy girl!Thank you so so much!! Getting clean is one of the best things I've ever done❤️I'm 23 :)

Thank you!!!❤️is it a thing now that we call girls 'dude'? :DAmen❤️You've got this, I believe in you!

It's the same with any addiction, one turns into 100 and I refuse to go down that path ever again!

I'm so sorry to hear about your friend, I really hope they can get back on the right path❤️Yes! I got clean July 1,2018 :)It was crazy how quickly my color started to come back! 

Congrats on your year and a half, that's amazing! You're kicking ass!❤️It's like those before and after commercials. They look so miserable in the before photos. 

If they had the same facial expressions.. then that's the after I'd really wanna see 

AnywaysI haven't had a soul in years due to addiction, PTSD, and anorexia. I finally have my life back, I can finally smile and laugh and enjoy life! 

I do take Kratom to combat cravings and xanax for panic attacks (I have a full prescription from the beginning of February and it's one of the few drugs I DIDN'T abuse) but other than that, I'm free from the demons that were holding me back.

I'm so proud of you man, sobriety is so worth it❤️Meth is less cardio toxic than caffeine Pills, heroin, morphine.Thank you so much!!!❤️❤️You think I should post this on there as well?? I've never heard of that sub before!Thank you, love!!!❤️I take Kratom to help with cravings!
I also have a prescription for Xanax for panic attacks but I haven't touched it since I got it back at the beginning of February :)I could go for a cookie right now.That's a first! I typically get Penny from the big bang theory lolThank you so much!!!Thank you!!! :)Thank you so so so much!!!❤️

It feels so freeing and incredible! Words can't even begin to describe what it's like to be the person I am today compared to who I was a year ago. I smile and laugh without force, I don't have to hide behind a web of lies, my sight is clear.

I noticed the other day how beautiful the world actually is when it's not so blurry and unstable. I'm the happiest I've ever been and feel like I'm actually living after being dead for 10 years!Lol thank you!You're so kind, thank you so much!!!❤️ 

I still have down days, it's not all sunshine and Skittles, but I'm as happy as a clam 90% of the time ☺️There absolutely is, love❤️ it's hard but so so so worth it!To each their own☺️Hahaha how am I intimidating?! SameThank you so much!!❤️Thank you so much!!

It was pretty rough for a few months but now I'm feeling WONDERFUL! Congrats on 30 months, that's incredible!❤️I don't need white knights.

You're partially right, I did feel pressured to go to rehab and get better, but I didn't have friends swooping in to tell me to get help because I don't have any friends, I lost them all because of my addictions. Yes, my family pressured me to go to rehab but I'm the one who found the place and checked myself in and I stayed the entire time, even when I had the opportunities to leave early.

What I learned in rehab didn't stick because I wasn't ready to get better. I got clean on my own, for myself, because it's what I wanted. I was done with being miserable 24/7 and always looking for the next fix. I was tired for wanting to die all the time. I was ready to give up that life for a better one. 

I got clean 11 months after I got out of rehab and it had nothing to do with what other people were telling me to do. It was for me.Do you need a hug? I'm a great hugger!I certainly can be!Thank you so much!!

I get really excited when I get notifications :) I don't have many friends so when I have people to talk to, even if it's just a simple response, I get really happy!�Thank you so so so much! This comment made me smile like crazy!❤️ This is my favorite sub, I love how loving everyone is! I'll definitely be posting something when I hit my one year sober mark❤️I believe in you!! If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm a great listener! :)
And thank you so so much!!Thank you so much!!! ❤️Stay strong!❤️Thank you, I am as well!! :)Thank you so much! It is a sobriety post lolWhy thank you!You're so strong for pulling yourself back out of your relapse, that's one of the hardest things to do! I don't know you but I'm so beyond proud of you for getting your life back❤️

Have you ever tried taking Kratom? It's the reason I've been able to stay on track and also kick cigarettes and alcohol as well as drugs!

It's like we get a second chance at life!❤️ Again, I'm so proud of you, love! That's so awesome!!! Keep up the good work, congrats!!!❤️❤️❤️I'm 23!I lived in Connecticut for a little while but I'm a born and raised North Carolinian❤️People have said that and I have no idea who she is! I hope that's a good thing!
And I've been to rehab :) ???There were many reasons but the main one... I fell in love. I knew if I kept using, I'd lose him. So I quit the day of our first date and I've never looked back :)Yes but it wasn't all because of opioids! My sex life (up until now) was horrid and it ruined sex for me until I met my current bf.

I've noticed that Kratom doesn't really affect my libido but it does dull my senses.Thank you, Jeff!!!❤️A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

Thank you!❤️Oh I know and I live in NC so there's just not telling what's gonna happen but I have a very reliable supplier who said he'd make sure I get my stuff even if it becomes scheduled :)Thank you so much!!! ☺️Thank you so so so much!!! You're so sweet!!❤️Addiction and anorexia have stolen over a decade of my life, I refuse to let them take any more!

Thank you so much!❤️Hahaha thank you so so much!!!❤️❤️Thank you so much!! It's all in my past and I'm never going back!❤️Trust me, you want to stay at the weight you're at because I'm sure you're gorgeous! I've suffered from anorexia for over a decade now and it's gotten REALLY bad since getting clean (gotta trade one vice for another, right? Haha). I'm trying to get my weight up because my body looks AWFUL (even though I secretly like it) and I'm so afraid my heart is gonna give out. Please don't go down this path, you beautiful soul❤️❤️Thank you so much!!!❤️Thank you so so so much, that means so much to me!❤️

I try to be the best person I can be to others, everyone deserves kindness even if you don't receive it in return! 

Your comment really made me smile ☺️Thank you so much!!I had more drugs in me than a pharmacy but I couldn't tell you what I was on when I took that pic. It was taken after my ex threatened to punch me in the face for drinking a glass of wine.Oh please. Quit with that shit. I’ve been using opiates for almost a decade and my pupils always look the same, opiates or not. Unless I take MDMA. Not everyone is the same and it’s ridiculous to think you can tell whether this girl was or wasn’t on opiates from her pupils alone.Cleaning the women's restrooms at the restaurants I worked at. God that was awful. Wow, what a shitty comment, just looking for some material to fuel your fantasies?  Why would you think this is at all an appropriate question to ask? [deleted]We all have our preferences!I'm not sure, I never really went to meetings! I thought they were quite boring lolHaha yes I really am the same girl! Just more lively!
And thank you so much :)Thank you so much!!!

I'm definitely far from preppy but I HAVE stepped up my style game slightly! Although, I say this as I'm playing video games in giant sweatpants and an XXL sweatshirt so... Maybe not �Thank you so much!!! ☺️☺️Lol you're not the first person who has said thatThe one on the left :/Personal preference, I suppose Not at all, we all have things that we prefer, that doesn't mean it's fucked up! Well, within reason hahaYou're so sweet, thank you so much!!!❤️❤️❤️☺️I lost weight actually.The fuck?Congrats on your personal 9/11!You don’t even look like the same person lol. Keep it up!Proud of you but the girl on the left is my current type.. I have a problem with being attracted to girls with drug problems.. lollllYou should be so proud of yourself. I know I am!Idk you but im proud! Longest ive gone sober since i started in 2010 was 7 months �. You’re golden anyways. Ppl always focus on the bad. You’re the champ — keep it up. You’re worth 10000000000x more than the drugs/booze. Always remember that.Ohh. Just saw this comment. Yeah. I bought 108 was very underweight... Please take care of and learn to love yourself, hun. �Your smile shows that! I wish you the very best, don't ever go back. It is a dark void that will steal your soul. It's taken me 20+ years to figure that one out! 

Live, Laugh, Love!Man that’s so young to be struggling with addictions � anyways, your looking good and you have a wicked future ahead of you hopefully � all the best bro ���I call all people dude or bro I guess, unless I know your name �‍♂️ nothing bad meant by it, but we are all the same in this gameOMG my clean date is July, 22nd 2018 <3 im right behind uCongrats! I got clean for a and a half. Had a relapse two months ago but better now. Ik smoking bud is a drug but i dont crave it like im a big pill head. Not into dope or speed or any thing. �  but good for u!Yeah it really is! Like along with color and some weight, one goes from looking like the living dead to actually looking human. Keep it up you're doing amazingly! 
& thank you :') <3I have bipolar type 2 with mixed episodes of psychosis, but I always know I'm in psychosis when it happens. Word up. My family's starting to be chill with me again but that took months, I'm not currently "employed employed" but I do legal odd-jobs. Addiction is the one thing I've found that logic doesn't work against. I was thinking that the only way to beat the game is to stop playing, in regards to this. Goddamn I'm stoned lol.I meant to say it was neurotoxic, not cardiotoxic. 

Hashtag high posting lolAnd your ROC? Sorry, I'm just curious because your story is remarkably similar to mine. I was just kidding; play on words for a less than savory sub of similar name.   Grats on the clean time btw; it's hard but also very worthwhile, I know.You’re truly gorgeous, I mean it. I’m glad you were able to beat the disease of addiction. Remember to stay vigilant and don’t get too comfortable, that shit is waiting for you to slip up and it’ll grab you and try to pull you right back at the first chance it gets. You have more time than I do so it’s nothing you don’t know already, but it also can’t hurt to hear it again. 

If you ever need someone to talk to for support on a bad day PM me and I’ll help you out. 

Keep pushing forward! We can only go up from here now that the worst part is behind us!!! (:oh wow that’s really good about the xanax. i can’t say that i would be as strong as u with that. lol. but it’s definitely something i respect.  i’ve tried kratom before. it actually worked pretty well when i had a lower tolerance. it was like a mixture of vicodin and caffeine but not very strong. it always gave me these weird herbal tasting burps tho. lol

anyways, i’m glad to hear ur doing well. it’s always nice to know that success is attainable. keep it up![deleted]Yeah ; i feel ya, Ive been 3 months sober and reality its life ; its like taking off that bandage off and watching for how it is ; feeling it for how it feels, life is a rollercoaster of emotions a lot of people don’t wanna deal with ; thats why drugs give em their escape im just happy you’re strong enough to feel the air again; to breathe and walk ; eat and talk without a buzz , yeah it can be harsh sometimes but it couldn’t be light without darkness right �� you woke up and i bet theres no one more happy than the inner you ; now keep the process of learning how to live with emotions ; with feelings; ups and downs ; but damn you made it out  alive and not a zombie anymore ✌���‍♀️ charge that spirit , good vibes ✨ i wish you the best you deserve it , i think everyone who’s been throu hell deserves a lil piece of peace ✌� LolIf guess he feels you are too good looking and therefore "out of his league".You're very welcome! You equated the relationships with your loved ones to be of greater importance than your addictions. Which is good, that means you're not a psychopath. Most addicts come to that same conclusion. 

But the thing is, its fucking annoying that people are so reactive to substance abuse to the point where they believe they need to step in. Because the ultimatum always comes to "it's either me or the drugs"

The culture has made that ultimatum the end game 9/10 when the reality is drug abuse and relationships are two mutually exclusive things. People should respect peoples right to use drugs and let them fight their own battles. But fighting battles alone is impossible so the threat of losing people is enough to force complete submission and allow others to "help"I really hate saying what I'm saying because I know its toxic and encourages relapse. I just know it's the truth behind addiction. But still, from the bottom of my heart I congratulate you on your sobriety. And I hope you keep it up. But It really saddens me when I see people holding a gentle sobriety on the facades others build for them. And it makes me prefer the misery of addiction 

Even though deep down I know theres a real life outside of addictionis that not what ur doing here urself lol Girl, a hug wouldn't come close to curing the depths of my spiritual malady. Thanks for the offer though.Put yourself out there bc with all the real stuff that I'm sure you've had to go through, you'll find friends in no time. Plus that smile will definitely attract other interesting people. Happy days ahead ��. Please be sure to let us know when it's officially your 1st year, you got this! No problem and thank you, that's very kind of you. I'm not much of a talker, I wouldn't call myself shy but more... closed off I guess. I do appreciate the offer though and if I ever do need to talk, I'll remember this comment. Congrats again on the sobriety.thanks :) i’ve never really tried kratom...just use minimal benzo/lope/weed for acute wd. 

This was just a few weeks of an oxy binge so i’m feeling wd, but not awful by any means. My blessing and curse is that no one really cares where or when i do my work so long as i produce...gets me in trouble. 

What made you decide to give up alcohol as well? I don’t think I could ever because of all the social stuff for work, but it’s never been my issue. It's a good thing :), she is very young, and talented singer. Check her out on YouTube. When the Party's over, or Bury a Friend etc... :) And I didn't mean you should go to rehab, I assumed you did ;). Was trying to tell the others out there that may read this :)[deleted]Maybe that was a backwards compliment. You shouldn’t hide your improvement with a filter, it’s disingenuous to your hard work. Be you, filterless, editless. �Might be your evil tethered twin 

(This won’t make any sense unless you’ve seen US)Of course! Very proud of your sobriety! ok well that’s good. I hope u continue to do good. and hit me up on here if u ever find urself feeling week and needing some help. i don’t mind. It is sort of odd to say/see, but the eyes are one of the biggest differences.  In the "clean" photo you actually look like you have life in your eyes, the "dope" photo you almost look dead-eyed.  I mean that as a compliment, while I realize the whole "dead eye" thing probably sounds more like an insult.You’re welcome. I love your attitude and the change in the pic reminds me of when I got clean. I was 6’2” like 165 when I went to rehab. I thought I looked fine, but I looked like an addict that never ate. Just wanted to show some support. 

And like I said don’t stop doing whatever got you this far. I eased up after a year thinking I was good and went on a ten day bender before finally getting it to stick. Good luck. You got someone rooting for ya in Texas. I was specifically talking about opiates with the pupil size. You coulda been on every other drug in the book and ur pupils wouldnt have been tiny (except for antipsychotics like seroquel. They also constrict pupils)

Meant no disrespect even tho that's what people always jump to. Even tho idk how me simply saying ur pupils werent tiny would be offensive.Its a known fact 100% that when you use opiates your pupils get tiny. Unless maybe youre doin meth or coke which make pupils huge.

I didn't mean any hate, i thought i clearly said im not sayin negative shit.  When i see a old pic of when someone was using ill check if their pupils are pinned.

Or if i run into an old using buddy i usually just glance n see if their still using or not by tiny pupils.

If i see an old picture of myself in the past 10 years ill try n see how my pupils look. Idk what all the freak outs are from.This is the internet.

People who think they can tell others what to do and how to think with the word "appropriate" are the biggest assholes out there.

Yes, I was looking for a good story.

If you don't like it, then fuck you.My ex was a cheerleader at an ACC school, 2/10 white knight harder.I can see you in your eyes :) Awwwe please don't think you're not beautiful clean because you 100% are I'm just a weird one. Now there'll be more than just scrawny white dudes with problems hitting on you! Congrats on 9 months though! Just picked up my 6No mam, you are the one who's sweet now. Are you clean now? Like never even feel like doing it again?Well you look chubby. Like just look at your face compared to the older photo?Just some super thirsty dude I'd guess.Hahaha why thank you!It was an inside job!This comment is ���Lol I like to think that's a good thing! You should've seen my face when I was drinking all the time... My cheeks were HUGE. I was 140lbs at the point, 122lbs in the pic on the left and I'm now 108lbs!I really am :)

Thank you so much!!!7 months is a helluva an accomplishment! You should be proud too!Thank you so much, love, that means so much to me!!!❤️❤️❤️Keep fighting, it's all so worth it! It took almost a decade of my life, I refuse to let it take any more of it!I started young but I got out young, I still have my whole life ahead of me❤️
Thank you so much, man, you have no idea how much your kind words mean to me!Yeah I'm 23 and going to rehab today for my 3rd time. 
Congrats OP! Nobody likes you when your 23 :(Well im 18 and addicted to oxyare you implying it becomes better for you/ easier when your older? �Congrats, dude! That's so awesome!❤️❤️Lol hey, whatever pays the bills, right?? I'm basically just a glorified babysitter that makes barely enough to get by (and I live with my dad, so that's saying something) but it gives me purpose and I love it! 

My family and I are finally on good terms, for the most part. they're still not happy with my eating disorder coming back but that's just another demon I'm gonna defeat!

Addiction is hell but you can pull yourself out, you just have to find that strength within yourself. People can help but you have to be the one who wants to be free❤️I'm so sorry, what does ROC mean?? What does the "C" stand for if it's "route of administration"? I've seen the acronym a lot and knew what it meant from context, but never known what it actually stood for.ROC? lolAhhh yes, I am very familiar with the Kratom burps lol, they're not fun! But it's the one thing that has worked EXTREMELY well for me! It even helped me quit smoking cigarettes! 

Success is absolutely attainable! You got this❤️I didn't ask you to care about me or give me attention but thank you for doing both by leaving a response �Don't hold back on my account, my sobriety is pretty damn solid.

You're right, a lot of people do submit to sobriety to preserve their relationships and that's when sobriety just doesn't work out. But that's not the case with my situation. 

Fighting addiction alone isn't impossible. It's not easy and it's not as effective, but it isn't impossible. You need to save yourself to actually get better, you can't wait for a "white knights", as you said, to come in and save the day. I really hate you feel that way and I truly hope you can find some light in your life to show you that sobriety is actually wonderful if you embrace it. 

I've been an addict for years so I know the truth behind addiction as well. I've relapsed more times than I can count. But this time is different. When you know, you know.

If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you. Again, I really hope you find hope, addiction is a dark and lonely place.No problem! I'll send a batch of cookies instead!❤️Trust me, I'm gonna make a huge deal out of it lol

Thank you so much for your kind words❤️❤️If you ever feel like the withdrawals or even the cravings are too much, I suggest trying Kratom. It really is a life saver! I don't think I could've gotten through WDs without it!

I can understand that. Idle hands are the devil's play thing, you know? But the fact that you're getting out of it on your own is HUGE! 

Along with being an addict, I was a huge alcoholic. If I couldn't afford drugs, I'd buy alcohol and get black out drunk (I've been to the hospital more times for alcohol than drugs) because I didn't want to be alive anymore. I quit drinking first mainly because my dad said it was either quit drinking or move out. Then quit drugs because I fell in love.Thank you!! I'll check her out as soon as I get out of work!❤️Ohh wow I'm a ding dong, I'm sorry!!

I completely agree! I went on my own, I wasn't forced, and it's the best thing I could've done for myself❤️ well, most of it. I did end up making a 6 month long mistake but I fixed that lolAhhh I hate to disappoint but I was just a waitress!All I can picture is Gemini from Binding of Isaac �Thank you so much, I really appreciate that! :)It's not an insult at all, it's true! Most of my pictures from before I got clean are hard to look at because I had zero life behind my eyes and they were just so dull.I'm so proud of you for getting clean! It's one of the hardest, most rewarding things ever❤️ your comments are so sweet and uplifting, thank you so much!!

You've got someone rooting for ya in NC❤️I didn't take it offensively at all! :)I'm a heroin user, my pupils usually only get pinned when I take a LOT. At my average level of high-ness - they're normal size. You have a weird personal definition of “known fact”.I never told what you could or couldn't think or do. I just stated my opinion, that it was a shitty question to ask, and pretty damn sleazy.

If you don't like it fuck you too! ;)[deleted]This made me smile :)I didn't take any offense at all! Everybody has their own preferences, who am I to judge? :)Congrats, love, that's great! Keep it up! ☺️I am 100% clean but there are definitely times where I get cravings to use again, especially when things seem to be falling apart, but I stay strong :)Thank you, I appreciate that!FIRE CANT MELT STEEL BEAMS!Outside jobHow tall are you? Np, it’s true. Keep it up, you got this!!!We're on the same boat. I started young (around 16) and i am almost completing 2 months sober (at 23 too). Shit's rough but we can do it! I dont mean to sound negative but don't go in with the mindset that you "got out". I was clean for 4 years and I started using again. I use to think this too, I started when I was 19, got clean at 20 and was clean until 24. It will be a part of you forever, even if you don't want it to be. Keep trying! You got this! You're gonna do great, dude! I know it's scary as hell but, trust me, it's so worth it!❤️Rehab doesn't work but take it slow on your next relapse 19 recovering from heroin here damn arent them pills like 35 a pop nowadays?Not implying anything. Just chatting to the young lady. Fuck off elsewhere if your trying to cause an argument ��That seems like a pretty cool gig. Ngl I had a free couple fat hits off the foil with bth a couple weeks ago for free and I did some fent last week so my long ass 289  clean streak is broken. I'm not too bothered, what's weird I still I really like opiates but they don't hit hard enough anymore unless I IV and that's risky business.Route of administration. So, did you snort, smoke or shoot your heroin? It was a typo. I meant ROALook into Beano (just get the large bottle walmart equivilant) it's a enyzme that helps break down what your body has trouble processing. For me it wasn't just kratom burps but full on kratom farts that were beyond awful.[deleted]It's good you were able to find a genuine comfort in loved ones over addiction. I know it takes constant work and that takes a lot of strength. It doesnt change the status quo, though and this culture is causing addiction to be as life threatening as it isWell good for you :) Luckily I’m not around a lot of supply so my main trigger is when it’s in front of my face, which is rare. 

Hope you’re enjoying your freedom. All good, congrats again, and keep it up. You're doing great, and look amazing!no problem. it’s not easy being an addict. it’s just good to know ur not alone in the world. You’re welcome! And I didn’t think it was possible, but after about 7-8 years I realized I had completely lost the temptation to use. I’ve been offered pills at work so many times, and I’ve had a bottle of codeine just chillin for over a year. Opiates don’t cross my mind unless I’m clicking on this sub. 

I find this sub helps me remember how bad it used to be. Be good out there, miss NC. Bro theres nothing to argue about. This is medically known for 100 years. Opiates cause pupil retention.  Then when you get about 18-24+hours sick your pupils get huge.

If your pupils arent pinned then your just not taking what your tolerance requires to get analgesic effects.

If i do 100mg per dose to get high, then i take 20mg, thats just not enough to account for the tolerance.What is that supposed to mean?  Do you also believe the earth is flat too? All opiates cause pupil constriction broYou just over here wishing you could get a girl under 200 lbs lmao

https://imgur.com/a/Ugc40usIt's a pitty that I can't saw it :) The fear was that I'd be interpreted as the judge, you the jury and the rest of this subreddit my executioner, downvoting me for my tastes. So you are my savior u/xpoloroidx, thank you.Oh yes, that's great. I never did drugs. Not even once. I wanted to do that but when I see people falling apart, I just back out and think about something else.How do you feel when you get cravings?? I hope I am not asking too muchYou look cuter in the first picture, maybe you should go back to opiates. *JET FUEL can’t melt steel beams.Actually it would be an inside job till the explosion then it would be an outside job5'5.5-5'6"! We got this! I'm so proud of you, 2 months is an amazing accomplishment❤️❤️[deleted]FOH.Honestly go fuck yourself, you’re no better than anyone else. 

/u/sausageturtle330 Don’t listen to this fuckboy. Get all you can out of it this time around and stay focused, maybe this time will be your last. Once you’re over the physical withdrawals, use that pain you felt as motivation to never feel that way again (assuming you’re detoxing from opiates). You don’t have to live the lifestyle that accompanies an opiate addiction anymore, it’s truly no way to live. If you need someone to talk to PM me. Take it one day at a time and you got this. Get it now while you’re young, we have the advantage over the old heads that have been drinking and drugging longer than we’ve been alive. 27, addicted to fent-dope (scramble) 5 gram a day habit20 addicted to IV meth/fentanyl late to the party but 19 addicted to oxy + fent. No such thing as starting too young.I buy 20mg for an equivalent of 0.6 dollars but im from czechiahahaha i was just joking, but jeez   your defensiveness  is real i didnt realize  you were a thuuursty ass nigga, i love when people expose thenselves for no reason whatsoever � 
anyways i wasnt looking for and argument  but you clearly are so ill just nip it in the bud. im sorry you were offended  by my joke thay had nothing to do with you,  i wish you the best , good day my friend.We all have slip ups, my man! It's not a relapse until you let it be. Just focus on the positives and see how far you've come. One slip up doesn't diminish all the progress you've made!Mainly shot and snorted, never smoked!Maybe that's why I'm so freaking bloated all the time... I'm definitely gonna look into that! I'm actually going to Walmart tonight so it's perfect timing! Thank you so much!!Three comments, that must meant you care A LOT!Thank you so so so so much!!❤️I'm not arguing the fact that yes, in general taking opiates makes your eyes pinned, but the point is that you can be an active opiate addict (and not in withdrawals) without your pupils being pinned 24/7. I've had enough today to stave off WD's and my pupils are just about normal size.   


To the OP: well done on getting clean. It's fucking hard and you look great now. [deleted]I figured as much :) don't worry, I'll even upvote you just in case!Not at all, I'm an open book!

I feel like I want to claw myself out of my skin, I can't think straight, my anxiety goes through the roof. I either get very frustrated or silent, depending on who I'm around. Sometimes I cry.

It's not easy, it doesn't come and go. When it hits, it stays for a while. But I push through and keep reminding myself of why I got clean and what I've accomplished since but also of what I could lose if I ever go back. Going back, even for a moment, will never be worth all that I'd lose.Absolutely, I'll get right on that.108 at 5’6”? That’s *fairly* underweight, sweetie... And your cheeks look fuller and more plump in your long-term sobriety photo, in all honesty... I’m glad you lost some of the weight you put on from drinking, but 122 is likely closer to an ideal, HEALTHY weight (body mass index) for your height. 
I’m just looking out - you need to keep your HEALTH as your first priority. At all times."First time" you're just proving my point. 1.6 years clean I just railed half a 30mg roxy and I feel fucking amazing.Yo why is everybody so fucking salty. Statistically we're all going to relapse a bunch of fucking times before we get clean. And its more likely you're going to have a life threatening OD when your tolerance is low. Trying to save lives here bro, sounds like your just regurgitating useless words of encouragement.holy sweet flying fuck! they are a dollar a fucking milligram here in america!Bit late but sorry dude. I was having a bad day ���Thanks for the words of encouragement and your perspective �As I said, your story is strangely similar to mine. I'm also a teacher, I'm 23, female. I started with pills as well, but tramadol instead. We don't get much oxy/hydro in the UK. sit on my face You literally just repeated what i said bro. 

If ur only barely taking enough to stave off wds, then you're NOT HIGH on opiates.

The whole comment was about the pupils being normal size which means she wasnt high on opiates in the picture.

Why are you still arguing about this petty bullshit?  Youre acting like a childBruh, you're homeless and beg people on reddit for money, the only action you've gotten in the last year is the time that crusty old homeless dude took advantage of you beneath that bridge you sleep under �Thank you for that
And I am really sorry that you have to go through this all. How often you feel this way?I'm just kidding love, you look healthy. 
Congrats. Yea, my anorexia came back full force once I got clean, unfortunately!

What's funny is, no matter how much weight I lose, I always have chubby cheeks when I smile �[deleted]Someone going into rehab needs words of encouragement. If you have the mindset that you’re going to relapse you’re obviously going to relapse. Relapse doesn’t have to be part of recovery. It usually is, but it doesn’t have to be. There was no need to be so negative, that’s not helping anyone. And it’s quite obvious you weren’t trying to save anyone’s life, you were just making a snarky comment that no one was having. They might be useless to you, but maybe he’ll get it this time, you have no idea if he will or he won’t. You’re just assuming he’s going to fail. You need to help raise people up when they’re down, not push them back down. Who cares about statistics.. honestly, if you want it bad enough you’re going to stay clean.nw hope ur all good fam, peace and love!Wow that's crazy!
I started with oxy and then basically took whatever I could once I spiraled. 
I'm in the US :)Are you clean now?You should play Dragon Age, you seem to be quite bored.Bit oversensitive aren't we? You're the one who took a good-natured comment and decided to take it as a personal attack and turn it into an argument �

Stating one's point of view is not arguing, and you don't need to have the last word on everything. It doesn't matter. Grow up. [deleted]Of course, love! And don't apologize, we all go through our battles, this is mine!

It's become more often recently, unfortunately. When I got clean, my eating disorder came back full force (cuz I just can't let myself be healthy and happy lol) and it's been causing a LOT of tension between me and the people in my life. Before I got clean, my way of coping with stress/anxiety was to use but now I don't have any vices, I even quit smoking cigarettes back in January. I'm having to relearn (healthy) coping mechanisms all while trying to get my weight back on track (I just keep losing more) and it's just... Tough. But I'll win this battle, too. I may be physically weak but I'm strong in many other ways.You're entitled to your own opinions, who am I to judge? 

But thank you, I appreciate itI’m sorry to hear that, sweetie. I’m going through something similar currently... I won’t divulge too many personal details, but you’re welcome to message me anytime regarding this, hun. ���

I also have that same problem, as well. When my now-fiancé first met me, some fat chick who liked him got hella jealous he has always ignored her and - in her mind - to top it all off, now he had a girlfriend! He posted a photo of us together at a huge music festival on one of our first dates. The photo was just us from the shoulders up, and my cheeks are really round. My dude calls me his “lil chipmunk” sometimes when he pinches my cheeks! � 
Anyways: this fat, crazy chick - who he wasn’t even dating or talking to, SHE simply wanted to fuck HIM, and that was the totality of the ‘relationship’ - had the goddamn balls to message him saying his “new girlfriend was FAT!” When, in reality, I was 135 pounds at the time, and she was over 200...Exactly. How long you been sober? who paid for your rehab?And you brother take it easy �I also have an eating disorder. Diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12. And I kind of recovered for a bit when I was 17, then slipped back into it when I was 20.No, definitely not. I'm going to order some kratom soon and maybe taper with that to get off the kit. only if we play togetherOk. Sure thing kiddo.  Obviously if you take minute amounts that isnt enough to effect you that you wont get pinned pupils.

If i drink a quarter of a can of beer then im still not drunk. Or if an alcoholic that drinks 30 beers per day, only drinks 3 beers one day, hes still not drunk even though a non drinker would be affected by 3 beers.

My original comment said that her pupils werent small in the old picture which means she WASNT HIGH ON OPIATES IN THE PICTURE.  What is the point of your peanut gallery comments? Dont you have to wake up for school in the morning? Go to bed already and quit the ignorant commentsOh now were getting all serious no more ��� emojis, im sowwy I hurt your feelings.Finally!! This is what I wanted to hear. No matter how bad the situation is, you just dont give up! That's so great and I am so glad that I could talk to you about this.  Just imagine the picture of the people when you get cravings, I am not sure but I think this will go away. You'll become healthy soon. You are pretty and you'll do great in your life. Someone said it to me "its okay to cheat as long as you don't make it a habit" I think you can sometimes smoke cigarettes or drink a little bit as long as it's just for fun. Btw what's eating disorder? And is it okay that we are talking all this in comments? I mean I could text you if it's okayMy only real opinion is that you look more healthier. Woowwww what a bitch, that's awful! I'm so sorry she did that! Bitches be crazy sometimes...

My boyfriend calls me Noodle lol

You're welcome me to message me anytime you want, as well! I'm an open book❤️

I hope things are going well for you now!Holy shit... My eating disorder started at like 10/11, I was diagnosed at 12, went to treatment 4 days before my 17th birthday, left 4 months later, and was fine until about 20. It started back up but was overshadowed by drugs and alcohol but has really picked up since getting clean. Are we the same person?Can you let me know a decent UK place for kratom? I’ve never found any reasonably priced uk stuff before.  Feel free to message me if you want to talk regarding recovery, I’m uk based and recent got clean myself, trying to keep straight and narrow. Absolutely.You really need to chill, dude. I don't know where you got the impression that my comment was somehow directed with hostility towards you, but it wasn't. I was just adding my two cents, because in your original comment it sounded a bit like you were saying that she was not using at all at the time the photo was taken.

Seriously, what's with the aggression? [deleted]There are definitely some people who CAN cheat but I'm not one of those people. I won't even let myself try because I don't want to risk all of my hard work :)

Anorexia, basically I starve myself so I can be as thin as possible.Thank you so much, love, that means a lot! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I always said, “Man, I could have a nice car with all the money I spend on my habit.” Now, a year clean., Content: , ups: 1031, downs: 0congrats dawg, looks clean as hell. Please call it your soberu. Please. 2015 WRXYooo, that’s clean my guy! This is motivating, thanks! Cool *and yet* still slightly sensible!! Good call OP
Congrats!Beautiful car and nice job staying sober man! Ya I like it.  Nice ride!One day I will sieze this victory! Congrats OPFuk yeah bro....now the dope man see you in a nice whip shooting the middle up as you pass[deleted]Sick whip dawg lol #jealous lol !��Was looking at the exact same car to get as my DD/Commuter..identical to yours.

Subie Bros! (Kinda, my girl drives a 2010 legacy)

Love her car in the snow, awd donuts are fun as fuck. Even though hers is the 2.5 you can get it to slide through corners on dirt roads no probif someone is in recovery and they don’t drive a subi, are they really even in recovery?

jokes aside, congratulations dude! i’m proud of you!schwet!Awesome. I got a car too...but it’s not picture worthy, only a 08 Prius

But boy I wish I had it when I was using cause it only takes like 17$ to fill it up and get 300-350 per full tankHell yeah, it’s crazy knowing I would spend like a car note on dope every day. The amount of shit you can afford when you’re clean is such a wonderful positive reinforcement.Way to go man! No bs. That's not an easy hurdle bro. That's so awesome! I say the same shit these days and decided today that I'm serious about kicking my habit. This post came at a great time, truly an inspiration, congrats!!Even if I gave up the habit. Which I have for now but its been on and off for a couple years now... I don't think I could afford this. :/ 
What do you do if you don't mind me asking ?
And how long did it take you to save up for it ? This is the kind of post I love to see!!! Apart from all the H and 30's but a fuck up story changed around! I'm trying to overcome all my addictions and get myself a Subaru! My dream Car man, Congrats ! YOU DESERVE ITBut also, if you are clean, isn't it kind of a bad idea to be lurking the opiates subreddit?

  
But in the back of your mind....maybe? Congrats bro!What is that, a Prius?now doesn't that feel so much better than a bundle of dope thats only gonna make you feel ok for a few hours or days... enjoy it man you EARNED that car!!!

Fuck yeah that's awesome. Congrats dude Well we have three or four, but still... not trying to deal with service issues on a new car. HahaCongrats! This is actually the car I’ve been slowly saving for, I make a good amount of money for my age I’m 20 and a area manager at a retail store so the pay is pretty good considering every manger in that store is 30+ so I know I can do this as well I just have to put in the hard work and dedication to stop my habit, 2019 will be my year (,:Hell yeah think of all the escorts you can fuck in thereI don't see  a nice car, only a Subaru??Gtfo with that positive shit.

You should install a Cobb access port �  Nice dude! Plan on doing any mods or tracking it? 


My man and I have a 07 Nissan 350z and ‘14 Scion FR-S; theyre our babies, I hope we can get clean so we can go back to modding our cars agains. 19 STI! These are fucking amazing cars ♡ 
http://imgur.com/a/m4HZLkfBeautiful carThis is extremely motivating. I am so sick of the chase, but so petrified of standing still. It seems a bit moronic that I tell myself I can't do it or don't have time because i have to be a mom. I can't take time for recovery because my kids would be without me. But, they are anyway even if I am present because I am not so comfortably numb anymore. I am more just surviving. They deserve more. Thank you for sharing your success, keep it up. I help lots of people stay clean and get help, but can't seem to help myself. These posts keep me motivated to do better Read the follow up post, fucktard If 951 has to do with the Porsche, you have good taste in cars. For that price, I'd get an older STI. Yes sir!Thanks!Haha. Thanks!Curious what a "car note a day" is? What was your daily habit costing at its worst if you don't me asking. Or what's the worst you've heard of. I think a lot of ppl in here hope to be clean one day...lol...I'm here, but started methadone almost 2 months ago....Yes. Sometimes. But in an odd way, it gives me my fill, or ill read about how sick someone is and I instantly go back to when I couldn’t get out of bed and cold sweats and shit. No thank you. Haha.Lol. Always.Haha funny guy[deleted]Get an older one. They're still dope. How much do you think you've spent total? Don't have a dope habit but beat a GHB addiction but that was relatively cheap. I'm always curious what peoples daily habit costs.Sorry bud, I’m loyal to only one escort. And she stay mounted on the dash on the lookout for 5-0. Lolahhhhh, the smell of a warm random shitpost that everyone will glance over...Sheesh guy.  I hope your plug comes through soon so you can relax.Auids are  are for peole like  you who are into schieza  porn and genocide. 
Subi gang!
GANG GANG! 
P.S this subi will %100 smoke ur little 1.8L 2003 A4 so calm ur tiny nuts.0ii6%=I own an 08, COBB stage 1. :) I plan on it.  Trying to still figure out what I want to do with it.  Exhaust, body kit, etc.Thanks!  Still trying to decide.  Probably the Cobb and exhaust.  Nice!! I like the STI[deleted]I think you should look at it the other way, you want to get clean *for* your kids. Don't use the short term pain/necessity of withdrawal as a reason why you can't do it. You can do it! and your kids will be proud as hell.I'm a mom too...I started methadone almost 2 months ago...I get what you're saying about feeling numb, and the guilt that goes with being a mom and an addict....Thank you for the kind words.  I’ll save the cliche words because you know them already.  You have to have a made up mind about it.  Part of the way I found success was because of my ego.  I always told myself that I had my habit in check, and I could go without if I wanted to, and by the time I looked up I was in a place where I was definitely not able to do that.  So I made up my mind, I’m not doing this anymore.  
Here’s a tip I will share.  Don’t bog yourself down with thinking about what you will do for the rest of your life, think about the next five minutes, then the next five, then the next day and work on controlling those, and you’ll be on a good path.  I used to scare myself back into it because I felt that there was no way I could live the rest of life sober.  Well you don’t have to, and you don’t have to think that way.  Find a little substitute, weed worked for me, and get going.  And before you tell me weed no longer gets you high, don’t. Haha.  Eat an edible, hit a gravity bong, get some CBD (you can order that online), and get going.  It’s too easy to get weed these days.  And trust me, I used to say weed didn’t do it for me anymore either, but that’s your opiate brain telling you it’s no good, I promise, when you’re sick...some weed will be your saving grace.  And it’s the thing that helps keep me in line.  Without it, (if I were trying to live the rest of my life sober), I would have fallen all the way back down to where I was.  Instead, I may want it some, then I just come home do a couple bong rips and it’s over with.  [deleted]Oh god no. Older means modded, no bueno. I was looking at a Focus ST as well but the R Golf was really fast. I was thinking of another M3 but I have an M5 and X6M already.Car bill a day maybe?Oh I’ve spent upwards of 300-400 a day. I imagine it’s worse for those with the means But that IS a badass automotive bro. I'm excited about this because I have nothing to show for my failures into rehabilitation.

INSPIRATIONAL YOUAt that high of a monthly payment he's definitely not putting a lot down or it's something he shouldn't be financing.i was just browsing, no way im gonna put almost 1k a month payment on a truck that wont hold its value over time, unless its a ford raptor (they hold nearly 90% of their value according to doug demuro/auto trader)

but i really love luxury trucks.... probably gonna go with an F150 with all the best options

and actually i was wrong, F150 platinum STARTS at 504$/month i thought it was much higher.... so probably would be close to 900 all together with insurance, after upgrades. Heroin addicts typically spend between $40-$200, sometimes less or more but that range covers most heroin users I'd say. The range being light to heavy use.

But prices differ based on tooooons of variables.I've been an addict for several years...and my addiction has gone up and down...but on average, I would day that I spent around $2500-$3000 per month on pills the past 2 years....it was a little lower than that over 2 years ago, but with tolerance and prices always increasing,  that's where I was at when I started methadone....so, in all....I'd say I've spent $70,000-$100000 on pills during the last 8 years. Makes me so sick to think of. I could have paid of my college loans with that![deleted]Id have went with an EV of any sort! Renewable energy all the way!    But congrats on your year clean.[deleted][deleted]It feels bad because I feel I don't have the right to stand still. I wish it were that simple. I want to be well for my kids. I am in hospice and moved, losing my care. No one will take me on as a patient in the place I moved. So, I am in forced withdrawal and can't drive the distance to see my prior hospice doctor. It was supposed to be all set up. These are the issues that go on in the world as all are well aware of, thus the steady increase in heroin use among patients and subsequent deaths as most of us have had no experience in it. I want to be present foe my kids without the unspeakable pain of the disease other than the dependence these meds put me into. I want to find something natural to help the pain my last time here with them, but i have tried most things. I want weed. I can't get it here. It carries the same jail time as any hard drugs. But, there is still hope. I am going to visit the methadone clinic closest to me. I hope they take someone like me. I hope they realize I am no different physiologically. That my body depends on this to be ok. I hope they realize I can't do this cold turkey and I can't do it alone. There is a stigma that patients can't get help in some areas because we were not out "scoring on the street" and it's not taken as seriously. I have been told to just suck it up by a few uncaring doctors or to drive the 8 hours every month to my previous one. It's a long complex issue, just like we all have our own story I guess. Yes, I want to be well for my kids. I don't want to be bed ridden from the pain of the tumor or the VEDS, and i don't want to be bedridden from endless withdrawal. I don't want to be a zombie either for the time i have left. I wish there was a middle I could find. Perhaps something that would not just mask the physical pain and let me even live a bit longer because they absolutely need me. I am a mother of 12 year old twins and have been fighting to stay alive since they were born. I have made it 10 years past what try thought I would. So, I know I am a fighter. And, all that i have been through should make doing cold turkey easy...but this is one thing that has stopped me in my tracks, has brought me to my knees, and made me feel like I would do anything just to make it stop. But, I am not doing that. I am locked in my house, have no car, I have made sure I can not leave to do something out of desperation. I came to this forum because more like it need to be in place. Someplace I can talk freely without judgment society often brings with such topics. I can talk to people who have been through this and down this road before. It is a comfort knowing I am not alone. 160mg of Oxy abruptly stopped with no warning was not how I wanted things just as I am sure anyone else in my predicament or other predicaments. The reason we got here in my mind is not of issue, the fact we are here is..and i appreciate your words. I have contacted a methadone clinic and am thinking about going for it. I am day two cold turkey and I know i can't do it alone. Thank you for your understanding. I don't know if they will help me or look at my case the same as I will in hospice care until I moved, where I have not been able to find continued care due to being new and all the regulations that have now passed. I worry about some of the repercussions of Methadone, which makes no sense in the reality of it. I just want some semblance of normalcy back. I need to work and be productive as long as I can. I need my sanity. I think I am just petrified to make the leap and worried what family will think. But, I need to do what is best for me and my kids. Thank you for your response. Sorry, but that went way over my head. What gen m3 were you looking at? And the golf was faster than the focus?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt. Car saved my life no idea what speed I was doing but it was bad enough for the front right rim to be sheared in half. Currently being fixed by my friends shop under insurance, he said the bill will be around ~30k.Exactly.  I bought my car with less than 20k miles and had to replace clutch and a few other things already.  Moral of the story is everyone rags out Subaru’s.[deleted]lol nobody cares about your follow up post, what are you bipolar? you obviously felt some type of way, go back to crafting those anal beads...Follow up post don’t mean shit if you are an asshole from the start. The guy has been clean for a min and saved up for something he wanted, then you shit on it. So who’s the asshole?I had a Chevy Spark EV. Actually a really nice car. Zippy too with 400 ft-lbs of torque. The only thing is unless you're driving a Tesla, your range is only gonna be like 100 miles if you're lucky, so you have to live in a city that has charging stations all around town, like a big California city, or Dallas, etc. Still, they're inexpensive to buy, cheap to maintain, and only cost like $30/mo to charge at home. Oh, my bad G.  I didn’t realize that was also you.  Gotta condense those comments haha. At least reply to your own comment lolWhat model? My recent “gift of sobriety” was leasing a MB C300 hah.  Whenever I bitch about the money I just think about how much I squandered on dope. * stock wrx 
That says it all put the money u spent on that audi on a subi+ less than half of the difference in mods and ur left quicker than a baby on a doorstep.will it smoke a tesla?Yes, you do. You have to take care of yourself first momma! If not, all else will fall apart.  Methadone saved my life.. Day in day out when I was using turned me into a mom my kids did not deserve and I finally went to a clinic and started on methadone and I was very lucky that it worked so well in such a short amount of time and didn't have to be at a really high dose, so my drug use stopped that week and I've never used again. It changed my life and my kids life. Everyday when I was using, even having a steady supply so I didn't have to be sick all that much, but I would get up in the morning when our alarm went off and my kids would get up and sit at the kitchen table to wait for breakfast.. And me? I had to go to the bathroom and do a line to get me to even function enough to get my kids food.. After they ate, they got themselves dressed for school and then watched tv for a bit before leaving for the bus.. While they watched tv I did another line dreading the walk to the bus stop. Once they got on the bus and I came home I spent my day getting high until they got home and days I didn't spread out my drugs good enough and withdrawal started setting in.

  


I was stuck on the couch watching the clock and battling the anxiety of wanting time to go faster cuz I was waiting for more drugs or couldn't get any and wanted the day to end, and on the other hand, I didn't want time to move at all cuz that meant me having to make dinner and give baths and just taking care of my kids in general and it took everything in me to do simple things.

  


I used to think God I'm so lucky that my kids are amazing and know how to do a lot on their own and they don't need me for everything and I can stay laying down and once I got clean and on methadone I felt so guilty for thinking that... I'm not lucky that my kids could do the things they did cuz I was either high or sick 24/7 and had a hard time doing things with and for my kids and as long as I did the absolute necessary things like feed them and bathe them and pay my rent, then I wasn't as bad as other addicted parents..

  


But that is not being lucky and my kids sure as hell weren't lucky!! They deserved sooo much better then I could give them and getting on methadone gave me a second chance to be the mom they deserved. Like you I couldn't leave to rehab and I certainly didn't have will power to do it myself and I stopped finding things I couldn't do and things that I kept putting off that I could do to help me and made my first app and it was the best thing I could of ever done!! Please please consider getting on methadone.

  


I know it seems like your replacing one drug with another and ya I guess it is, but there are many reasons to still go on it and any reasons you think are bad reasons to try it will never be good enough reasons to continue the path your on. Yes there are ppl who abuse methadone but those ppl weren't ready to change their life in the first place, so as long as your serious about it you can do this.

  


What ever your worries are now, trying to get your life back and move to a better path will be much easier to do when you stop using and you take something you only need once a day and everything that involved getting drugs and all the bs with it will no longer be something you deal with anymore and all you need to do now is what's best for you and give yourself a break and stop feeling guilty and let methadone do its job so you can focus you more important things!! Then after awhile and you feel stable and life is where you want it to be, then you decide with the dr if it's time to wean off and get fully clean.

  


However you stated your in pain and you were in hospice care, so methadone is likely even more right for you as it's very powerful and I personally know ppl on it that got addicted to pills and couldn't keep doing that but had bad pain and regardless they needed pain relief and methadone not only got them to stop abusing pills but it took care of their pain better then anything they ever took. So seriously consider it as it may work wonders for you, and again if you still want to find something for your pain down the road and get off methadone, you can do that but hold off doing any sort of weaning off once you've stabilized and your life is better in every way.

  


honestly if methadone stops your pain and works really well, it's not a bad thing if your on it for a very very long time. What matters is that you live the life you want to.. Someone with major depression that absolutely needs meds for the rest of their life to maintain a happy life wouldn't just not take their meds when it works for them and methadone for pain is no different.. If you get to be who you want to be and live the life you want to, and have it be pain free and stop using other drugs that can take you back down this path and that means using methadone for life/very long time, then why wouldn't you? Don't let the stigma cloud your thinking on this! It can absolutely give you your life back and could stop your pain so that you don't need anything else.. Two birds one stone lol

  


Also maybe look into cbd for pain.. I live in Canada and weed just became legal but before that I was always able to find CBD that has no THC and so many ppl swear by it for pain. I use it for anxiety and depression but it's supposed to work wonders for pain and it won't make you test positive for weed if you end up going on methadone and the clinic tests for weed. So that's something to look into.

  


If you ever need to talk please pm me anytime :) from one mom to another, I know what it's like to be done and wanted to get better and I did and so can you! You don't have to do it alone and there's no reason to do it alone when there are other ways that have helped thousands of ppl. Let methadone do its job so you can be the mom you want to be and get your life back and never worry about any of this ever again!!! ❤️I was worried about starting methadone also...mostly bc I have to go in every day but Sunday for my dose...and then eventually, over time, I will get more take home doses as long as I'm clean. It's just a pain in the ass....BUT it keeps me from messing around and selling my dose or taking too much...like I did when I was on suboxone. I've tried suboxone, cold Turkey, and even the vivitrol shot....but methadone is the only thing that actually feels ok to me. I still used a little for the first month....but I went from taking 250-300mg per day to only 60-90mg per day....just to help with some of the break through withdrawal symptoms...bc they start you off at 30mg and slowly move you up...now that I'm at 65mg of methadone I dont feel the need to use opiates as much at all...my cravings are way down, and sometimes I'll go awhile without even thinking about using....so far methadone is working the best for me...and hopefully I can stick with it! 
Good luck to you as well...it's hard, and you're right about the cold Turkey crap...its almost impossible to deal with and not use...the only way I could do cold Turkey is if I had no access to opiates or I was in a detox unit....Bicycles maybe?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt.

Such a beast of a car, I went from a Mazda 3 to this with a akrapovic exhaust installed it sounds like a super car. 600HP Bi-Turbo.I had a E36 M, E 46M, but not the E92 so was looking at one if those. I would grab a nice E46M but they are getting overpriced now. Of course a Hellrot Red E30 M would suffice �

I need to drive about 50 miles one way into Miami  daily so i needed something quick, agile and really good on gas, oh and 6spM of course. The ST was nice but the Recaros were a no go. I am 6'1 250 lbs..I dont need AWD like a WRX, so i am trying the Golf. Damn, well those 6 series are heavy beasts with tons of electronics and safety stuff so no surprise it saved u. Glad u are ok. I almost wiped out a mom and two little kids so that was it for me. 

I was in a left turn lane waiting for the light and nodded out briefly. Well the lane next to me going straight got their green and took off. I woke up and just took off, of course my turn signal was still red� i turned right into the path of the Jeep and we missed each other by an inch.

That was 2 yrs ago this Nov. and i put to bed a 30 yr opi run.Yup, also there is only one Sub dlr around here and the service lanes are always packed, fuk that.I think when it comes down to it... It's a total roll of the dice on how reliable ur truck will be no matter what, they put together by humans and driven by humans, human error is prominent like I've seen brand new Dodge 1500 blow an oil line, 10k mile Silverado blow to tranmy, I've seen something drastic in all brands... None of those where in the last 7 years tho so it's getting better 
and then calls people a "fucktard" when telling them to read his bitchmade follow up post lmao, no wonder he stands alone �Hyondi has the Kona, and Chevy has the Volt or the Bolt  I think theres others. (leaf?)  lots are getting onto the 200 mile range now.  I personally have a Volt.  


Gets me anywhere I need frst 100km on electric, and about 500 more after that on the genie.  


I do about 60-70% of my mileage on electricity.Correct.  
  
 u/yttik822 , first and foremost, you must take care of yourself. If you need to take time to get clean and you have the chance, take it. Your family knows when you're not at 100%. Take some time for yourself to get there.  
  
I'm a mom myself, and gave up custody of my children to get clean and get a job. I know a couple other moms that did the same for themselves. Anyway, I've been working at the same place for three months, and I'm currently maintaining/weaning with suboxone. I'm not quite at a place yet where I could take care of my kids, but I'm trying my hardest to get there. You can, too. I believe in you! You can do this! Thank you as this is Information I needed. I was worried about whether or not it would help the pain from cancer. I know it's stronger than anything I've had. I have brain cancer and Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndome just to be clear so you know a little about me. A clinical case that scares doctors away as there is no fix, just relief until the day my body quits. I also worry because I need to get a job and it has to be enough to support a household if something should happen to my husband. He has carried me through the last ten years of surgeries and chemo etc. Otherwise, I have two Bachelor's Degrees and i accomplished them while going through all of this, but i am unable to work as sick as I am and half of that is even with my pain control, I am in too much pain. It's never been managed properly and I refused to up my dose higher in case I need surgery again and they can't control the pain as I am in this for the long haul. For me, it's not so much about getting "clean" as it is functioning. Not worrying if my insurance won't pay, can't leave town because meds are due, running a day short due to a bad day, etc. I could name all the reasons, but you know them as it's not different. I bought heroin once. I watch my friend shoot it and seize in my car. I ahd to do CPR and he almost died before I could get him to the hospital. But, that is how desperate I was to not be sick. Our insurance had changed and I was waiting on a preauth so I could not get my meds that day. Even after witnessing that, I still almost used it. It was by the grace of God, I flushed it and dealt with the withdrawal. If it can help my pain and it will not get in the way of rhe career i am trying to accomplish (there's not enough money in art and music for me) then I definitely am interested. Another fear, is closing the door to future hospice care should I find a doctor here willing to take my complicated case. If for some reason, the methadone would not work. I also worry as I am in an abusive relationship, if I left would my husband be able to take my kids. 

I also relate to your description of your day. I can't function in the morning. I can barely roll out of bed. It takes at least an hour or more to be functional. After 10 years, I wake up in full blown withdrawal, which should not happen on long acting meds. But, it does. I don't dream anymore as I don't go into REM sleep. I am perpetually tired. I can't remember as well. I am also very dependent in benzos. Those I never have issues getting though. Doctors seem to be less scared of them, but if you ask me they are more scary. I went a week without mine once just thinking i could...bad idea. And I don't even take all i am allowed to take as I hate nodding off. I hate not having control of my actions. It's why I don't drink or anything. Anyway, I will go. I only wish I had gone yesterday or Thursday as Monday seems forever away. I have Kratom. It helps a little. Not a lot. I used to have some great weed, it's all gone. Won't be to Seattle for another year so there is that. Here they have medical MJ, but it's not strong enough. Anyway, thank you so much and I'd love to talk more. It seems we can definitely relate to one another. And, for what it's worth, your story is inspiring to me.Yes, I agree, no matter the situation that ended a person hooked on opiates; whether it be illness in my case or other reasons, the outcome of not having them ubruptly is the same. And, cold turkey feels nearly impossible to me. I just wish i had gone in on Thursday when I knew I'd be dealing with this. But, even then I would be facing detox at home until Monday when a doctor could review my intake. I guess that is lucky though as in other places it can be weeks or months until someone can get help. In the meantime, bad things can happen. My heart is with anyone dealing with this on any level for any reason. The dialogue about addiction and dependence needs to change in this country. I hope it does sometimes. I wish you the best of luck and i am glad you found something that helps. This is so much more than needing a drug to function, it's a literal biochemical change and professionals need to realize it and treat it as such. I will know more Monday which route I am taking. In the meantime, I am taking the day second by second. No sleep in two days and all the aweful symptoms on top of the illness I needed the drugs to help. In my own opinion, it's so unethical for anyone to have to suffer like this. We don't let our dogs suffer like this. Why do we allow it for human beings? Take care. I think just talking on here and hearing that I am not alone has been one of the biggest helps. I appreciate it.Yeah, they're fun at hell! I used to actually be a BMW tech. Ah man, I love the 6spd e46 M3s,they're so dope. Maybe an S54 MCoupe clown shoe? Those are for fire as well. Yeah. The Chevy Spark doesn't take gas whatsoever. It's 100% electric, and is from 2014. The technology has developed a bit since then. I can imagine they're better than they were four years ago. Sorry I just saw this reply after I replied to your other comment lol.. Please go Monday.. Some ppl even get dosed the same day!Neat, but i need a DD/Commuter. A guy around me has a blue MCoupe, love it. His other car is a Ford GT.�It needs to be a four-seater? Yes, only due to i am a big guy and may need to run a 3rd person around. Iooked at the new Civic Si as well but that 1.5l is too small.

I looked a 2005 Z06 but it does not fit my mission. I looked at the Tesla Model 3 but holy shit $70k !!!!
I thought they were like 35k wtf ??What about a GTO? 

C5 ZO6 is fucking dope though.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😓💉🔫, Content: , ups: 1021, downs: 0You ever have a guy who can't make up his mind with this?

One time he barely exchanges a word with you while you're in some sketch ass parking lot, the next time he wants to sit in a Wendy's/chat for an hour & then the *next* time you come at him all friendly and he tells you to stfu? ���������Is anyone like butters from South park in these situations? Yes, I do believe I know what you are sayinglmaoThat’s really how it be to...�

Too fucking funny bro...����Thats why you meet at a store  or Walmart or mall.Real life! Ha ha ha... Real talkDidn't know Kurt was dealing by his own o\_o

&#x200B;"get up on the porch" said dBoy. This is a great picture though. That’s awesome as fuck. Although  the last dealer I had would let me use his bathroom to fire up. Then I didn’t care hanging out. Kurt’s like fuck Eric, I don’t want to hear about these bone thugs n harmony Right now I’m sick af! Is this a real pic or is it photoshopped? If its real this will be the second pic I've seen of Kurt Kobain hanging out with gangsta rappers. The other one was him sitting in a van with tupacI remember the days man... Lol. Damn i remember when i use to just hang with dealer for hours. He wven started calling me nephew because i went everyday and so neighbors wont get suspicious. You guys ever get dealers who leave you on read? Lol that shit kinda yikes.HahaLol one time i was coppin from my boy who was chillin with two bloods. We wound up talkin bout photo albums and the value of pictures to hold on to memories like pictures of kids and stuff. 10/10 great convoMost of the the time I don't mind chilling with my dealers, usually they let me get high inside, and are always passing around a blunt and/or alcohol, sometimes even a plate of coke.

For whatever reason I have never been treated like a fiend by my dboys, and seem ronalways garner their respect, resulting in great hood credit and short waits if inwait at all.Don't dip the pen in company ink��������Eazy E looks a lot like Michael Jackson pre-surgery.Lol sometimes the abundance of memes can be bothersome but this one is �I generally wont buy from someone unless I can sit and talk with them about cool shit for awhile anyway, unless I'm desperate and dopesick. Friends haven't fucked me over yet, but a rando dealer sold a friend of a friend a fat bag of fent laced heroin that would have killed him had he not done a small allergy test first. Be careful out there, kids.This made my day. 100%Too real���[deleted]Lmao that pictures iconic Whenever a dealer gets extra nice with me I know it’s because they just want me to sleep with them. The struggles of being an average looking girl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
This dude I’ve been going to for over a year is super super respectful though. Jokes with me, doesn’t get mad if I accidentally get lost, been to his house, met his family, even given him and his brother rides before. He’s never made advances at me and I appreciate it so much bc every other dude I’ve gone to has. 
So I guess I can say we’re friends? Whenever I’ve taken a break from using I genuinely miss seeing him haha. Such a chill dude and super down to earth. Lol cause the white boy in the hood, in clothes that don't blend in and his general look that stands out from the norm doesn't look suspect at all Everyone knowsThe funniest things are always true ! Kirsten face though I'd awesome ! I wish he was still alive !! Is that E and Yella? I hate it. Especially when I have an Uber waiting for me!!Ik, That's the irony This is gorgeous �That's the type that doesn't typically get caught. Constantly changing mo fucks with cops on your tail.dude sounds bipolar lolThey are not your friends why go talk to him like youre all homies next day after you were kewl with them the day before?..i also hate that shit when people try to be all kewl with their supervisors. I mean yes you want to kiss ass to be in his position. Especially when they cross the line. Not jealous,just know where you at,and your positionEvery. Single. Time.

It's a toss up between having to get into his car to either do a quick exchange or we sit and talk for 10 minutes. If not that we'll do a window exchange. Its different every single time and never know which method well be using every time we meet up Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, you don't have to keep asking. I never cop at Wal-Mart. Too much security and cameras. Restaurant parking lots is where it's at. You clearly have never had the luxury of copping in an open air. 

This is exactly the scenario every single time. Stairs and all.Or restaurant or store or mall.is it a real picture??  why would they even be chillin' together?? other than for some a-hole record producer to get a pic of his cash cows...Im assuming this is fake.  Ive seen one with him and biggie or maybe tupac in a van and its also fake but done very wellIkr like bro do you wanna make money or not??On read? Like a book? If so that must be nice,them giving you a book while your waiting Exactly and when you're chilling and they're smoking blunts you start working on cheaper prices for bigger quantities. Nobody was talking about having any sex with their dealer lmao You're doing something very human but also dangerous, you're attempting to create rules to follow to tame reality. This is the root and start of religion and superstition.

You should test your dope no matter the relationship you have with the dealer, good terms won't stop a chemical from killing you.Because it is? you dropped a \\That’s the jokeOr just sometimes he’s tweaking/coked up/drunk and has shit he wants to say I think maybe people enjoy being friends with people. What is the appeal in being on shitty terms with people you are constantly in proximity with? So u can maybe get on their good side for a potential hook up or the ever so rare and elusive *frontal of the bags*Not in the bathrooms Lol Walmart security is a joke though.I’m not sure. I mean All 3 of them are very influential musicians and probably had mutual respect for each otherThats the other one I have seen. I didn't know it was fake and always thought it was them being shuttled to or from the VMA's that year. Given that they were both big in the same decade that made perfect senseYo that pic isn't exactly fake, it was just cropped together to have them in the same photo, Kurt Cobain and BIGGIE were in that shuttle together. That means they're dry and waiting for the reup. At least in my experience. This is my problem all the time and it doesn’t make sense. You know they have what you want and you have told them you have the money and still they bullshit and take their sweet ass time . Like dude seriously do you want this money ? Because if someone else with shit just as good hits me up in the meantime , I’m copping from them ��‍♂️I know one dealer had magazines in his office, oh wait that was my doctor.I always test a very small amount of each bag before I dive in. I didnt mean for it to sound like I implicitly trust anyone who sells dope lolVery beautifully said.This so much. I understand we don't come from the same backgrounds, but I can guarantee we have similar interests and talking to each other for 5-10 min each day would probably broaden both our mindsets on the other person and their lifestyle/culture.Why consider your dealer your friend if you know he doesnt care about you and just your money. For the buyer   the only reason why  they would want to be friends is to get more free stuff. If possible. But you know that a dealer and a buyer wont ever be close friends.  Especially on a "business " that requires more cold heart than making friends by selling dope. In that case make friends on tinder.  For job being a friend with a supervisor is almost the same thing as a dealer. But the worker under supervisor wants a raise or if there is ever an opening supervisor would hook it up. This is where the saying comes in" is not how smart you are or what you have done,but how many people you know in the right places" i guess i see it that way because i went to school,i spent hours of the night doing homework to be somebody successful, never did i rely on anybody to get me where i want to be. Yes its nice having friends at work. But being friends with your boss ,to me it shouldnt cross the line. Especially if something goes wrong theyll tell on you.

TL:DR // dont expect somebody to get you or give you what you want. Dont rely on anybody {job} dealer only cares about his money and thats all (drugs) 

Ps. This is my opinion. Would love to have a friendly conversation if you dont agree with me on this Why not? My dude did that for a while. Lol it was always weird though. True that. Sure, but there's almost always a cop posted there, and if not, then Wal-Mart won't hesitate to call them. Plus, there are cameras everywhere. It's just not a good idea. may be true... but i don't really see "mutual respect" on any of their faces in this picture... do you?I wish it was legit that shit would be legendaryhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/kurt-cobain-biggie-photo-krist-novoselic-2072237Nah... Completely different whips. 


https://www.bananaklip.com/blog/kurt-cobain-2pac-biggie-photo-rare.amp[deleted]Acting kewl with my Dope man might not get me a friendship BUT I like to interact with them a bit beyond the handoff.  Especially if they're a new connect.  Mostly so I can get a feel for them and also it builds a level of trust.  Even if that level is tiny.  I like to know how the person im dealing with operates also so i/we can be safer about operations and avoid detection.I agree with not relying on people and all, but maybe the dealer thing depends on where you are and how your place operates.  I wouldnt try and make friends with someone in an open air market but where I am, you have to know someone and it helps to be friendly.It’s probably when Judgement Night soundtrack came out. All the grungers and metal doodz did songs together. Sub Pop SeattleDamn good article. Yea if Kurt hadn't been killed I really think music would have gone in a totally other direction.Thanks for that. I  glad to know you are one of the exceptions. And im sure theres more people out there. Not jealous or anything. Im just glad that you are ok and everything turned out better for you. Take care,and dont over do it (im no one to tell you that ,i know. Just mean well.)This was a good exchange and while I in some ways want to be friends with my boss I do understand that he doesn't actually give a fuck about me and would forget about me the next day if i got fired/left.  Dealers are different since they aren't paying you, its the opposite actually, so I can see and have become good friends with a dealer.  I mean at least with them you have a common interest and implicitly trust each other with some pretty illegal shit.  But ya no way I believe that I'm friends with my boss @@@@@@@@@@ Title: You were my best friend, Content: You were 14. You rode the bus home with us every day. We'd get to your house and run upstairs, only 15 or so minutes until your mom got home. We'd pack the bong, hit the patio, blast The Beatles and smoke until we were on the floor coughing. That 70's Show was always on at this time, right after Scrubs finished. We always talked about how similar your dad was to Red Foreman. We were young, high, and had no idea what the world had in store for us, but we were happy. Your house always had the best snacks.

You were 16. I drove us all home after school, and as always, we'd unload at your place. You and Marcus would argue over who'd roll today's blunt, and I'd sit back and laugh at how dumb the two of you were. Your mom stopped caring about us smoking pot, cause we were on the verge of young adulthood and both got accepted into the college of our dreams. Getting stoned wasn't quite what it used to be, as with all the pressures of becoming an adult, came unwarranted amounts of anxiety. We were also too old to act the way we used to when we got high, something that really only seemed to affect me because you were always so damn mature. I hated that. Your cousin sold us some xanax, and we'd split one into three and drift away. For those couple of hours we were untouchable. Nothing mattered, we were the only ones who existed. We couldn't imagine life any other way, why bother? Nobody could tell us we weren't living life exactly how we were supposed to.

You were 18. You finally had set up our dorm exactly how we envisioned; TV's facing opposite direction so screen-looking was a thing of the past, microwave on top of the toaster oven on top of the mini fridge, a drawer full of weed paraphernalia and 7 posters of our favor artists, movie scenes and cliche college quirks. You passed me the straw as I broke my roxy in half, pieces flying everywhere that I would eventually try and find later.. You were more accurate then you thought your were when you would joke about me doing that. I'd separate the big, fluffy line into three smaller ones, and you'd suck yours down all at once. My tolerance was the same as yours was, but I lacked the $200 check you'd get from your parents every Monday. I was always kind of annoyed by that, but you'd occasionally show my broke-ass some love. Me and my girlfriend were fighting, and it got so bad that you drove me 400 miles to see her while your car was literally falling apart every step of the way. Your parents were so pissed that you drove while your car was in that kinda condition, but you told them it was something you had to do. It actually hurt you to see me cry, cause it was something you had never seen me do in the 14 years we were friends. Your transmission was replaced and your parents were $2400 poorer, but we were on our way back to school. You had just affirmed yourself as the most caring person in my life. My dad had passed and my mom was back in France, but I had you.. and for that I was pretty damn lucky.

It was your 19th birthday. It was my birthday literally just the day before, and we would always celebrate them together. You walked into the dorm and I pretended not to notice you, which had recently become the norm. I had the funniest story of this failed attempt to spit game at some girls after psych class, but I knew I'd be saying that for someone else. We had stopped talking for about a month now, due to your stubbornness and my inability to break a grudge, regardless of how petty it may have been. You were wearing long sleeves in July, but I didn't notice. You'd sit on your bed and watch ancient aliens, and I'd find some excuse to leave the dorm. Your presence drove me mad, as I'm sure mind did yours. Truthfully, I don't think either of us knew why we were fighting, only that we were and that any attempt to act otherwise would make us look weak. My connection to all things opiate were officially cut off, but yours only grew stronger. After a fun week of dope-sickness, I finally started feeling like myself again. The benzos would kick in, and I'd head out to my new friends house. We'd hit every club, every big sporting event or social gathering we caught wind of, so we could take dope photos for people to admire on Facebook. You'd sit at the dorm, and watch ancient aliens with the lights always off.. No matter what time I'd come home, you were at the dorm watching that damn show. I brought some girl home one night, praying that you had found something else to do. You hadn't, and I officially had to take her somewhere else. I made sure to be as loud and obnoxious as I could while grabbing my shit, ensuring that you acknowledged my presence and current lifestyle as better than yours before walking out. It still hurt to see you like that...
You said nothing. You were still wearing a long sleeve shirt, and I still hadn't noticed.

You were 22. You were outside of the gas station when I drove up, smoking a cigarette. You were bench pressing 185lbs at 14 years old our freshmen year of highschool, and here you were a senior in college looking like you weighed maybe a buck twenty. Your skin was pale, and the bags under your eyes hung about as low as my thoughts of you at that time. I smiled and you smiled, but we had nothing to say to one another. We were strangers, and we both had very different things to do. I saw you a couple weeks later, and I was pretty drunk. You looked even worse than you did the last time I saw you, which had to have been a hard task to accomplish. I was worried. I spent twenty minutes lecturing you and trying to mirror your image onto yourself so that you could see what I saw, but it was hopeless. You didn't see the issue, either that or you were too far gone and refused to acknowledge it. The kid behind you was sketchy and hung around you like a shadow, stepping in when I started to get emotional. He told me to fuck off, and I blamed him for destroying my best friend. The drunken tears started to fall, but my friends in the car were yelling my name. The tears were wiped away quicker then they fell, but I know you noticed them. Your friend laughed, but you didn't. I still cared, and you did too.

You were 23. Your oldest brother had received his sentence, and would be doing 17 years for trafficking, possession and selling to an undercover. Your younger brother still wouldn't talk to you. You had just gotten out of jail for violating probation, after getting caught stealing a drug test at Walmart. I heard the news and almost laughed, I couldn't understand how far you had fallen. You were always so much better than me in life, it was unreal to see how things had changed. I had my degree, a good job and a support system of friends that held through everything. You had a criminal record, a pocket full of pills and contact list full of people you either bought drugs from or sold to. I'd see you occasionally as I drove to work, and every time it was like seeing a ghost. I had no feelings for you anymore, no judgement. My painkiller habit had picked back up, but for some reason I still felt above you. I ended up running into you a few weeks ago, while I was picking up a few oxy 30's from my dude. You seemed almost excited that we were back on the same plane of existence, but I was disgusted. You tried conversing, generally interested in how I was, what I was doing these days and how my mom was. My answers were short, and I couldn't get away from you fast enough. It was obvious, and it didn't take you long to notice. You had fallen pretty low, but you were still as conscious as ever. I watched you take a long drag of your cigarette as I pulled away, staring directly into eachothers eyes. We were officially on two different planes of existence. I had no business on yours, and vise versa. This was the last time I ever saw you.

I got the news today. Your name and face was plastered across my Facebook wall, where every memory and funny instance with you was on full display. I considered writing my own status in your memory, but I couldn't. It just didn't feel right after all we had been through, and how I had treated you over the years. The cause of death wasn't broadcasted, but it didn't need to be, I already knew. Though it feels like 10 years since I've spoken to you, I can't help but think about all the time we spent together. Every minute of my life from 7 years old until 19, involved you in some way. You were the kid who I experienced life with, who I made mistakes with, who I got my first kiss next to.. You always gave me shit for having my eyes wide open. You brought me to parties, you fought alongside me, you accepted me as a brother and let me into your family when I felt like I didn't have my own. You cheered for me when I won, cried with me when I lost, and threw up with me when I was drunk or dope sick. You cared about me, through everything, and I threw you out of my life when you needed me the most. You never needed me, you were always the one I relied on for anything I went through, but you were always okay. When the time came that you weren't, I no longer had a need for you. I abandoned you, and you still forgave me. You still sent me invites on Xbox live, you still told funny stories about me with mutual friends and you still told your parents about all I had accomplished. You still gave a shit, you still cared. You were no longer a part of my life, but I was always a piece of yours, just a little lost along the way. You were the greatest thing I ever gave up in this lifetime, I'm sure of that.

You were my best friend. , ups: 1016, downs: 0Jesus I did not have a signed permission slip for that feels trip.Fuck man that was beautiful.  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss. This was beautifully written and inspired me to reach out and bury the hatchet with someone I haven't spoke to in six months I am actually hysterical in tears right now. that was such a beautiful, eloquently written story. thank you so so so much for sharing...

I am deeply sorry for your loss. your words make me mourn right there with you. this cut me deep. a feeling all too familiar... rest in peace.

sigh.Story hits so close to home for me, it was almost scary to read that. My best fried passed away from an overdose 5 years ago. We had always been on the same playing field when it came to drugs until one day he passed me. I was still addicted to roxys but thought he was so much worst off than me. Everyone knew what he was doing and how he was falling fast but did nothing. I tried to help him out and let him stay at my house but kicked him out when I found that he shot up in my house which was so hypocritical cause I was still getting high just wasn't using the rig yet. I kicked him out. The last time I saw him he was with my dealer and he looked terrible. We exchanged awkward what's ups but I got out of there as fast as I could. All I could do was text him and tell him he was better than that's so needed to stop. A few weeks later after that I got a text saying he was dead. I didn't even ask how, I already knew. I could have done so much more to save him.

 Fast forward almost 5 years later and I've become a heroin addicted over the last 4 years. Shooting up daily for a year and a half and screwing over everyone I knew. I've been to rehab and halfway houses and still havnt managed to string together more than a few months. Now I have friends texting me saying I'm better than that and need to stop.i think back to my best friend and I'm exactly like him, it just took me a little longer to get there

 Addiction is hard and scary thing to see someone go through. Most people don't know how to confront it or feel to uncomfortable to do anything about. Sometimes it's easier just to block it out and move forward. The person addicted is so caught up that they don't see all the obvious signs of how close to death they are that everyone sees. I'm lucky to have a few friends and family show me how close I was to death and all I can do now is do everything I can to stop and accept their accountability. 

 It may sound cheesy or the situation may seem uncomfortable but if you see someone you love get that close to death do something about it. My biggest regret in my 28 years is giving up on one of my best friends and after 5 years I still think about it all the time. 

Sorry for your loss OPThis might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on Reddit.  
May he RIP.Damn man

Nothing like this to remind the human race that grudges and long term anger situations benefit absolutely no one

I'm so sorry about your friend, and I hope you are able to find peace sooner rather than later in this situation. It's not your fault, i know this is insanely more easy to talk than to act but try not to live in the regret over lost time. That existence will never let you move forward with life

Your friend would want you to keep going, to keep succeeding 

.I'm so so sorry for your loss ❤️I'm sorry for your loss. This shit is too real. Brought me to tears reading this :'( rest in peace to your friend, he sounds like he was a good personIt's so lame and cliche... But that really just brought tears to my eyes. Big hugs dude.condolences my friend. don't let your relationship at the end depict how you think back about him though. pm if you needa ear Ow. Holy shit.  This was amazing, I'm gonna hug my friends more often.this really touched me. i'm so sorry about your best friend. i see myself in your best friend, but i also see myself in you. we all have so many flaws. forgive yourself. if nonody told u today, i love you bud.This is so human and a wonderful, sad, beautiful, read.  Thank you for sharing this story and I really hope you will go easy on yourself.  It is really affirming to see such great people do exist and in so many of us.  We all have such suffering and it is so bittersweet to see what good friends you were and the reality of how our lives can go.  When my wife gets home I will definitely share this with her and others.  What a write.  Take care.Fuck this got me. It was good hearing from the other side. I have a neighbor friend i went threw everything with since the age of 5. Halfway threw college tho it became clears drugs weren't just for fun anymore and were part of my life. I've lost so many friends and have spent months being along since graduation. Everyone else having girlfriends and life and me stuck in the same day to day grind of just focusing on getting high. 

It was good to read this and see from someone else's proseptive.The was gut wrenching.....but such a beautiful tribute to your friend and to your pain. Thank you for sharing.I'm in tears. I am so so sorry. Maybe you could do something to honor him in some way. Although I think you just did. Oh man this hits home. I'm sorry to hear about your buddy. But at least you realize the treatment you gave him and have paid your respects.

Keep truckin buddy. Nothing I read on reddit has ever made me cry, but two years just fell down my face after reading all of that, and then that last line. That last line just did it for me.

Guys, the takeaway from this is to cherish your loved ones and your friends. ALWAYS.

You simply do not know how much more time you have left with them.I'm sorry man. Don'the be too hard on yourself.  It sucks but it's not your fault God damn this Reddit post is right in the feels Condolences...

I do not envy the endless amount of nights this shall keep you awake, in tears.This is beautiful. I am so so sorry for your loss. please do not beat yourself up!  Take this and learn from it. RIP dear friend. I could barely read the end of that through the tears. That was beautiful man im so sorry. I can relate.Damn.This one hurt. I saw myself and friend in this too a tee, from the beginning to when you got back into pills. The only difference is that after many rock bottoms, my friend cleaned up, and I was a the fucked up one now. I ignored him for so long to "focus on my sobriety" that now that he is clean, and I'm the fuck up, I can't bring myself to reach out, because I know he would accept me even when I wouldn't do the same for him when I was clean. Our mutual friend ODed a few weeks back, and I couldn't even walk up to him at the funeral, even though it was always the three of us back in the day....

Good writing draws the reader in and makes him feel like he is part of the story, and fuck if you didn't pull me in. Sorry for your loss homie.this story broke my heart... I hope all of you struggling with opiate addiction get help and get better pills are the worst. Sorry for your loss. What kills me is reading these types of stories that all start out with... We smoked pot a lot... Then leads to one of us got addicted to xyz drug... But people still get upset when you say weed is/can be a gateway drug.Opiates fucking fucking suck man. This has me crying thinking about the people I left behind when I moved across the country to get away from the habbit. I talk to my ex occasionally. And every time I tear up hearing how she still is shooting the shit. And I know it's just going to be a matter of time before I hear the news I don't want to hear. I'm sorry you lost your friend. Some people get hooked and stay hooked, some people get hooked and get out. Both sides end up losing something.damn that was a sad/good readWell-written reflection. The best of luck to you -- death that goes by with someone who one has not reconciled with is always difficult This may sound stupid... But was it a H overdose?Damn... that was deep man. Deep as fuck...



RIP





I know it is cliche but it is fucking true. You never realize what you have until it is truly gone.Oh god I'm tearing up. 

God fucking dammit this was beautifully written. I'm so sorry, OP. I'm so sorry. Here's to hoping you find peace. As someone who has lost her brother and cousin all I can say is don't give up on yourself!My heart breaks for you. I wish I could find better words but this post destroyed me. Take care of yourself man. Hauntingly beautiful. Sorry to hear this mate.FUCK I was not expecting to cry tonight because today as such a marvelous day but fuck this really hit me. I'm so sorry man. May he rest in peace. I've lost 4 best friends which includes my baby's mom due to heroin. I really feel your pain, trust me. Keep doing well. You've seen enough to help you, we all wish you the best. I saved this story to show to others, I hope you don't mind(I mean it is on Reddit). Hopefully your story will show at least one individual the right and wrong paths that are there to fall into. Super relevant to my life right now, thanks for sharing! And sorry for your lossHoly shit man. Wow. This one really hit me. Sorry for your lossWow, this really struck a chord with me man. I lost one of my best friends to U4 about 3 weeks ago, and of course his fucking funeral was on October 7, the day that toxic fucking garbage was finally scheduled. Seeing his sister and brother-in-law and realizing I was probably the only one that knew exactly what happened still haunts me to this day. They knew he OD'd obviously, but they have no idea about RC's, especially not U4. Every time my phone buzzes in the middle of the night, I still think he's sending me a link to some random youtube video, every time I go to make a call, my fingers seem to automatically gravitate to speed dialing his name. I've been mostly clean for a couple years now so I don't come here or post nearly as much as I used to, but I needed to let you know that you're not alone, for better or worse. Knowing how it feels to lose someone, but to a more traditional (?) cause, this makes me feel quite sad. Also, excellent writing.Man that's a great story/lesson/writing, I think I gotta call a buddy.... I hope others do the same.Hate to be the one but sounds like after the fact you're just trying to make yourself feel better about yourself, would have mattered a lot more if you came to all this before he died, and actually tried to help him.  Sorry, but seems that you just got the lucky end of the opiate trip and he didn't.I swear to god I'm just cutting onions.

At workHaving falling outs with best friends is the worst... I feel like this has happened to me way too often, and maybe I'm the problem? Anyways, I'm so sorry for your loss. What a horrible feeling. FuckI'm crying, i can't even imagine how you feel...

I'm really sorry.I didn't think I would tear up but I really did. I'm so sorry man.
Wow. This is a very well written piece of literature. I can relate to both sides of the story. Which makes it hit home all that much harder. I hope you don't blame yourself, and have the capacity to make peace with the love/lost. So many grammatical errors in this wall of drivel. Sounds like you made the right move cutting the junkie out of your life, congrats � now it's time to take life by its dick and stroke it till the cows come home � � [deleted]That is amazingly well written.  I connected with a lot of the things you said.  I have a feeling we are pretty close in age.  Everything you said about the college days and the falling out hit so close to home.    
       
Except I am your friend.       
         
Luckily, I was taken out of the life of addiction and am now in recovery (214 days clean).  I was forced to drop out of college when I went to jail and then to a CBCF instead of prison for my felony.  I am now back in school and will graduate in May.  I feel like this story hit so close to home because if I wouldn't have slipped up and got arrested, I would more than likely be in the same place as your friend.       
       
I often wake up to things on Facebook very similar to this.  Just last week a decent friend of mine, that I hadn't spoken to since I took my "vacation" from society, was the latest to lose the fight against heroin.     
        
If I were you, I would use this tragic loss as motivation to get your life on the right track.  I'm not saying sobriety is right for everyone, but at least take a look at what you are doing and where you are going before you end up in the same place as many addicts before us.  Good luck and stay safe.OP from what I've just read, it sounded like you were a total asshole to him. You looked down on him for becoming an addict while you were doing the same shit, just at a different degree. He didn't steal from you, didn't start shit with you or anything like that. God forbid he stay home the night you decided to bang some slut and couldn't handle somebody else being there. You laughed at him when you saw him in town and and when he gets arrested. He tried to talk to you and reconnect and instead you blew him off after you got your drugs because you just could not be fucking bothered. That's all you cared about.

That's not how you treat somebody you call a "best friend". 

Maybe we just feel differently, but I never gave up on my friends. especially one that drove you 400 miles to see some bitch while fucking his car up in the process, just for your sake. I would help my bros hide a fucking body if it came down to it. 

This may sound harsh, and I don't know the whole story, but I feel that you completely failed him as a friend multiple times when he probably needed you the most. Regardless, he's gone now. My condolences to you and his family, may he rest in piece.
 So sorry for your loss I can never bring myself to read these am I dead inside? Oh sweetie. I wish I had words that would help you. But there are no words. But I understand your pain. My heart hurts for you.
Hugs.Sorry for your loss.Someguy did a spot on parody of this IN A new Post. Op on another note I truly feel for you and hope writing it all out helped even a little bit.THe parody is greatwhy did i read this.... damn...I lost my best friend to heroin too. I know them feels.fuck man this actually brought a tear to my eye, having lost a friend of 16 years as well. but from being your best friend at 18 to hardly even talking to each other or acting like friends at 19? yea, i definitely think there was something fucked up going on in between there you didn't mention, especially if fighting with each other was really the norm.

 to me, it seems like your friend started banging dope in the dorm room and from there it got worse and consumed him. I'm pretty sure he still cared about you all the way up to the end though. your VANITY consumed you which led you to drop him as a friend during what was probably the worst part of his life. i can't really say you're the good person in this after reading it twice. My best friend died while we were distant and most of our contact had been tinted with my shitty attitude about him using. I hated that he was still doing it and I had a terrible immature way dealing with it. I never got to say goodbye and it still just fucking kills me sometimes. I miss my friend so much. Fuck. :'(

I also kiss with my eyes wide open, btw. Always have. Weird.Just coming across this and wow. How hard your post hits home brings shivers. 

Brother I hope this friend forever lives on in your future life experiences and pray your intimate story may save even just one soul falling down this terrible path.

Thank you for writing this. I do believe what you have said here will help remedy self-destructive trust issues with friends, new and old, and help my ability to understand and empathize with persons I no longer know anymore, but who I once felt were one in the same with me.

I never could wrap my head around the relationship with my high school best friends. Our group of 3 was the closest friends could be, yet evolved to become the persons we would fuck over, and hurt, the most. I always just thought that we really never were "actual" friends... at least not how normal people's friendships were. We all had such fun---the time of our lives---but none of that mattered anymore. this is fucking brutalHoly fuck. Man... um... shit.... hmm... uh.... Jesus Christ this is powerful... I just. I don't know... wow.Wow I can't but be sad for you and hate you a little at the same timeImagine how many upvotes you would've gotten if you were actually a good friendtruthfully that is all i can ask for in writing this. i really appreciate itFor real though. I miss my dead friends... anyway, how are you? still  withdrawing? I get so emotional and forlorn when I'm sick. I read that with one eye while nodding out a couple times and it still brought me to tears. Right?i cant agree more. i know that if i went back i could rewrite his fate, i have no doubt in my mind he'd be alive and we'd still be best friends. that's the hardest part about all of this. they say things happens for a reason, and i guess sometimes even the most terrible of occurrences are meant to teach us lessons we could never learn any other way. all i can say to you is please man, please make the changes you know that you need to make. we all see ourselves through this golden filter, where things seem so much better then they actually are. your friends see you for who you really are, listen to them.. not to sound corny but there are so many people who care about you, including me This is the most beautiful thing I've seen.  Wow.  May he RIP.  i will admit that i am not the most complex of minds, it kindve just came out the same way the thoughts occurred. i thought the same thing after i wrote it, but its more a memoir to me than a piece of writing. i do appreciate it budStrangely I understood the misspelled words you were trying to type. The whole point of this story was a release for myself, to let out all the guilt Ive felt since he died considering how I could have saved him by being a better friend. Saying I'm trying to make myself feel better by talking about how shitty I treated him doesnt make much sense now does it guyThank you friendWhile I completely agree with almost everything you stated about the original post, the last phrase I would use to describe it would be "heart-warming". IMO it's more tragic, sad, and heavy than anything, but that's just my opinion and how I interpreted it.[deleted]Thank you brotherOP took the time to write honestly.  I have a lot of respect for that.  It seems like he is quite aware of his failings.  He had the balls to write down the reality of the situation as he sees it.  There are some shitty people in this world who never admit or acknowledge any wrong doing.  This doesn't seem like OP.  He seems to be learning from life, and that's the best we can do.  You wouldn't be able to call him out if he hadn't directly written what he did that was not great.  Come on guy, go easy huh?Dude stopPeople often tell themselves they are "better" than someone else for not using the same method to get high or they are able to maintain a job and some degree of normality in their life.  I have a hard time believing that in all of your years you have never done this exact same thing; writing someone off and then having a change of heart later.  People make mistakes, and OP most definitely realizes he made a mistake and cannot change it regardless of how hard he may try.  There is a time and place for comments, both good and bad, however I don't feel like this is the time for a comment like yours.  OP is looking for support, and if nothing else, he is going to be the reason that one of us reaches out to a friend that we have done this to and that is reason enough for OP to post.I think you missed the point of the post. OP is admitting to being a shitty friend and feeling bad about it. Why kick him while he's down?It's perfectly alright to give up on your friends.   Especially if you are still dealing with the same issues they are.  Life is not about being crabs in a bucketi just read it, i dont know if hes joking or if i genuinely pissed him off. i guess it was a bit of both. honestly though i didnt see it blowing up the way it did, it just felt nice to write it all out like thatNicely said. I claim to be everything but the good person in all that had happened, writing this to myself was the most honest way I could think of in processing what had just happened. I had no idea anyone would give a shit or even bother reading, it just felt like a journal entrythe fact you think any of this was about upvotes just shows how big a tool you really arePeople don't change unless they want to change. I think he meant the phrase "brought tears to my eyes" was lame and cliche. Maybe? I didn't find the memoir to your friend lame or cliche at all. Beautifully written. Sorry for your lossExactly, you're just interested in making yourself feel better.  Sounds like both before and after he died you were mainly interested in yourself.  Just calling it as it is.  Like I said, you got lucky.I know you didn't just say "tell a cop." ... That is literally the worst idea I ever heard. Please do NOT I repeat DO NOT go to the authorities and tell them about your friend who is using opiates. It's already done, I'm not going to delete it because that's how I feel about it. If the mods feel that what I said was bullying or hate speech I have faith they will remove it. I don't think it is though. I honestly think that if this didn't happen OP would have gone the rest of his life without speaking with his friend again and not thought twice about it. Then once the guy passed he suddenly cared enough to post this romanticized version of him writing someone off. 

I've heard the phrase "some people only love you after you're gone",   and I think that holds true here. Maybe I'm just jaded.No no,The dudes name is opaitesparody or some shit like that I guess he starting to parody some posts that are found on this sub and was just having fun. At least I didn't sense that he was upset or pissed in any way with you, he was just fucking around. While that's true, and I upvoted you, we can make a difference. 

People don't change unless they want to change, but we can help change their perspective. I know I've personally made a huge difference in dozens of people's lives simply by showing them a different point of view. 

I've also tried to help many people, until it became obvious they didn't necessarily want my help. Then I have to let go. It's difficult to determine which is which oftentimes. 

Opiates are a special danger. It's not actually clear what the friend was hooked on, but drugs like heroin and its like, or on the other side, crack cocaine or crystal meth, are demons I don't wish on anyone, or anyone's loved ones. 

But yeah. In the end I can't want someone to change more than they want to change. That's a losing proposition. Im starting to think you aren't really smart there guy. I wrote this one day at work while grieving, having no idea it would get as much attention as it did. i had no one to speak about it with, so i essentially wrote a memoir for myself, as a way to acknowledge my guilt, and express the way i felt the only way I knew how. If you think going into length about how shitty of a person I was to one of the best people I ever knew made me feel better, you're a fucking idiot. if anything, i wanted to tell a story that could potentially help anyone reading from making the same mistakes I did, and judging by the comments, I did just that. And yeah, that does make me feel better. Fuck off dudeSeriously, that's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking heard as far as helping an addict. Cops are not there to assist recovery, they will destroy the friends life. i hope the mods leave your response because to be honest it was the only one i really expected, there just happens to be a lot more understanding people on this forum then i ever would have imagined. i dont blame you for your views, they are accurate as shitty as i feel to say that. i would probably have the same reaction as you, i just wouldnt have taken the time to have written it outGood on you for sticking to your guns. Because you're right. Though I don't blame OP, and this doesn't mean he's a bad person. People hold grudges, people pass judgment, people grow apart. He's human. Respect to him for owning up and putting it all out there.

But that doesn't change the fact that you're right. Your words were harsh but true.  They want to hear the truth but not really.  They only want happy truths. Speaking the harsh truth is something people dont want to hear, because it makes them uncomfortable and its not PC.   
  
There is an overused cliche word that has lost its meaning over the last few years, but it is exactly the word for OP.  
  
**FAIL**.  OP literally failed ~~his best  friend~~ someone he was once friends with.
  
My condolences to the deceased, his family and those that were there for him.  
 
EDIT: Gilded for saying what people are afraid to say/hear.I get that you're grieving.  Just calling a spade a spade.  Hopefully someone does learn how not to be a friend like you. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 50 days clean, not homeless and got my dog back!, Content: , ups: 986, downs: 0I love the one in the back taking a very majestic leakStopping by from r/stopdrinking to say congrats!what state is this in? it looks really pretty.

Being reunited with your best friends.  Jack and Coke?You spelled dog wrongFeel you.  I remember.   I'm hittin 9 yrs next month if all keeps goin good. All it takes is one step in the right direction ,followed by another ,and one more , another one after that.   Start  please.   Love youGotta be a doppelganger unless you've spent some time in the upper midwest, went by KK occasionally and often traveled w/ a pooch named Remi.Are you just jealous or something?? Good on the Op for stopping by and letting some old friends know that she made it through. Prob the biggest accomplishment of her life. Regardless of where she posted this why would anyone ever hate on someone kicking addiction in the ass. OP, I'm super happy for you. This is not directed at
The OP and just a general statement but I find it attractive that a girl has the will power to get clean and also the open mindness to try opiates in the first place.
I've found this sub to be way more active than recovery and many people here even if using are supportive Good man, still clean and loving life. How about you? Im not jealous or anything like that, but I'm sorry dude watch this is post number 2 like this. In the next week or two we are about to be flooded by posts like this. I just dont think it belongs here, it's nothing personal against OP, honestly I'm proud of everyone who quits but still it's really not the place. 

I guess I'm the minority when it comes to having this opinion and if that's the case, it's the last time youll hear me bitch and moan about it lol.

No hard feelings dude?

Have a happy new year man!Totally I agree, I was wrong to say what I said in my original comment. I may not agree but I respect everyones decision, who am I to say what belongs here? I was wrong, should have kept my mouth shut if I had nothing nice to say.

Have a happy new year dude!Yea I guess my post had more venom than I meant it to. I see where you're coming from. Have a happy New Years man. I applaud you for replying to me in a mature manner, goes a long way in life. It takes a lot to admit you were wrong. Kudos to you!We are all family here as far as I'm concerned. Family, from time to time, will disagree/fight/argue about silly things. After reading your first comment dude, I kind of agree. If the majority of the community has no problem with these posts and likes seeing them then who am I to say it doesn't belong here. I have respect for everyone here and honestly there really is no harm in active or once active community members posting about their achievements whatever they may be. We support each other... I was wrong to say it doesn't belong here, because this isn't some bullshit dictatorship lol, plus we are all equal. My bad for my original comment, again didn't mean any disrespect and of course I'm happy to see one of us make it out of this shit.

Anywayyyyy, you doing anything special tonight????PS: Most of the time on reddit you need a little venom in your posts because most subs arent like this one. Lmfaooooo we where and still are an actual loving community compared to subs like wholesome memes. We are the OGs of that shit lol. Mad love for everyone here, across the board, you guys have lifted me up and helped got me through the hardest and most challenging times of my life. That is why I respect everyones downvotes on my original comment, that's everyone telling me, "yo dude chill, you are wrong here, take a step back and reevaluate your stance/opinon" On any other sub I would have gotten 10 pms and 10 replies telling me how Im such a piece of shit and all that, instead there's still love, doesn't matter about my differing opinion, you still talked to me pretty much as respectful as possible and I appreciate that man. I fucking love this place and everyone in it, hell I owe my life because of the way everyone here is. Haha this is pretty much the only hood where it's actually all good. And that's why i posted here. All this love. Its amazing. Plus i didnt know of the other sub. When i was thinking of being clean i looked on here for help and tips. I was hoping someone else who might be struggling could see this and get some hope from it.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Meanwhile outside of Purdue Pharma’s headquarters this morning..., Content: , ups: 958, downs: 0This is fucking, beyond brilliant.“People say [OxyContin snd Percocet] aren’t a big deal, but then you’re hooked and you run out of money and you turn to heroin.”

I can almost guarantee most people who switched to heroin wouldn't have done so if pills didn't blow up in price when they cracked down on them. At least when we were all doing them, we knew exactly wtf we were getting.

I'm not saying these pharma companies aren't evil, quite the opposite actually. They pushed oxycodone hard on the streets by making it so easy for doctors to prescribe it which got people hooked.  I wouldn't be surprised if the pharmacutical industry did all this because they knew that they had buprenorphine in their back pockets. That way they could keep making money off of addiction when their addicts decide it's time to get clean. 

This is all an obvious side effect of the good ol drug war. I wonder how quick they got a Whif of it before it was too late for it not to be a spectacle.Purdue is my bae. You like dilaudid original formula? Thank purdue.
You enjoy oxycontin? Big ups to purdue. 
Ever take senokot to relieve your stopped up ass from the OIC?
Gracias papi purdueFinally! One I won't accidentally knock over!This is fucking fantastic. Hopefully it gets some good coverage I'm the media.Ok but nobody is going to mention the giant amount of heroin in this spoon just lying there???Meanwhile people that have no other outlet for pain management need prescription opioids.omg I'm an idiot and I thought of Perdue chicken! I was trying to figure out the connection between chicken and drugs.Oh wow lol.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story,amp.html

He was arrested. Placing the sculpture was a misdemeanor charge, and refusal to remove it was a felony. I feel like placing the sculpture didn’t actually break any laws as evinced from the fact they didn’t actually say what the charge was, only that it was a misdemeanor. Purdue pharm hiring the local pigpen (police department) as their goons/muscle.

I could understand failure to comply and remove could be a felony. And that was probably their plan all along because the misdemeanor charge is fucking bullshit.Art imitates life!!Godzilla called, wants a front on a palette of dope.Made by Mr D. EspositoLMAO- now that is funnyBeautiful.This guy is beyond awesome. And he stood up for what he believes by that link. Hes A+ in my book.D.espositoHells yeahCan we get two 'hip hip hoorays'  for the artist!

I've never seen a more perfect piece of guerilla art. And his willingness to take a felony for the cause is awe inspiring.Thanks for posting this

(I also wonder if I could get a good cotton shot off that)Thank you Hooooly shit this is good. We need to go put one in front of every single Sackler property in the fucking world next. I don't think demonizing Purdue is very fair.This shit is great. Solid act of civil disobedience.Seems to me like he was simply trying to enjoy "freedom of expression", per Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Purdue would have done well to graciously thank him for his gift of art. Or perhaps they feel people who use their drugs would never end up using a spoon, yeah, that's it, couldn't happen.GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS! you cna shoot a whole bottle of 80s at once with that thingOhhh I get it now!
Thought it was another tide ad...We boof you faggg ass spoon...dope I. A syringe in my ass ....don't date about nothing Hate the company, loved their products.Upon first glance I thought for sure this was photoshopped. So very glad it's not. This really says a lot with no words necessary!Fuck yes!!!the corporations aren’t the problem imho... 
I’m capitalism every corporation has to maximize profits and keep up an endless growth... If someone won’t play after this rules their competitor will push them out of business. 
The problem is the whole system and/or the lack of regulations. Neat, this in Stamford, CT where I grew up.Legendary...I woulda anchored the damn thing to the ground, tooDude this is so incredible. I wish he woulda bolted it to the concrete so they woulda had a harder time removing it. Either way it’s possibly the best installation I’ve ever seen in my life.Kinda dumb. Unless his brother was one of the 1st patients prescribed the use of Oxycontin he would have known it's potential to be addicting. Thats on the user to keep using. None of us would blame a dealer for using and having an addiction because its on us. You can stop if you REALLY wanted. Would y'all be cool if he did this out side your dealers house?Because they forced everyone to take pillsas chronic pain suffering person, i cant justify blaming the people who make the drug, its the fucking law makers that are at fault (at this point) for restricting access to medications, purdue certainly plays a part, but i am extremely greatful for them making the drugs they do that allow me and millions of others to live, 

this is coming from someone who has committed suicide by heroin and lived after a 30 day coma... because my medication where abruptly stopped after a decade, people, especially my generation (im 30) really need to fucking take personal responsibility for what they do, the drug company didnt force you to snort that pill or shoot it, or eat it, they simply made it available for people with pain  those who fell in abuse/addiction because of the ease of access or however it came to be, thats a tragedy, but personal responsibility is above just blaming the people who make the shit... Roflrofl you soyboys are so pathetic. Youre whats wrong with america ironically.Thanks to all the people who cant take medication resposibly you have royally fucked all the chronic pain suffers. You chose to fuck yourselves up and have drug everyone down with you. This is F’ing epic, I wish I could of seen the faces of all the big wigs... Yes, totally brilliant! Especially since the Sackler family (of Purdue Pharma) are huge supporters of the arts. The north wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is named, “The Sackler Wing,” and there is also the Sackler Gallery, in Washington; the Sackler Museum, at Harvard; the Sackler Center for Arts Education, at the Guggenheim; the Sackler Wing at the Louvre; etc. 

It would be awesome is one of these could be dropped outside each of the institutions bearing their name. 

I already shared this link below, but their support of the arts makes this even more fantastic. 
[Empire of Pain]
(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) Wait though, what is he trying to say?  I feel like everyone is upvoting this because it’s cool to see a giant heroin spoon, but is he actually on our side?  I’m not sure I understand his message, so if someone would ELI5 I’d appreciate it. Old news. Buprenorphone isnt new. Been around a longggg time. So yeah, they set up the timeline so they could market it accordingly and make their dosh. No big secret.The point about buprenorphine is well taken especially if Purdue and reckitt benckiser have some back deal connectionBuprenorphine is still fully under patent ... and thanks to evergreening with new "improved" formulations will continue to be for quite some time.

Oxycodone (and all other classic narcotics) are at the very very tail end of the whole patent/evergreening process.  Awfully profitable little coincidence if you ask me...

Likewise most of the major players influencing this push against narcotic pain management have *major* stakes in large scale drug treatment programs ... like "Phoenix House".

Ever hear of PROP (physicians for responsible opiate prescribing)?  ...well all of their major stakeholders also own stakes in Phoenix House.

Everyone complains about Purdue's corruption and their role in the opioid crisis ... but the major players "fighting" against the opioids are engaged in *exactly* the same sort of unethical shady business.

The only difference is the shadiness on the part of the anti-opioid crusaders is hurting people with chronic intractable diseases ... while Purdue's actions hurt people using drugs illegally by choice.  In a lot of states there are actually laws on the books meant to ensure Pain patients receive ethical treatment from their doctors that are either being ignored and directly violated ... obv. there was never any expectation an addict would be treated with opiates for their addiction, but we have laws meant to ensure exactly that take place for the patients who need them.

Plus when you factor in the reality that this interventions against doctor and patients have actually had an extremely obvious negative effect on the targeted population ... the actions on the part of the anti-opioid fucks is just not in any way redeemable.  Not a chance did they play they long con of purposely getting addicts hooked. It was simple there was a massive untapped market of people who suffer daily from pain. In the past strong pain pills were not used for chronic conditions only end of life or short term like surgery. They already had the drug OxyContin they just had to aggressive advertise and market to doctors how safe it was and they were able to take over the market. And chronic pain is HUGE. Not just the number of people just your talking about having those people taking multiple pills everyday for life. If you get the market share which you did your ROLLING in money. 

They made there fucking money long ago and any lawsuits they face will never even come close to how much they made. I’m not sure but you can clearly see a police car pulled up in the background. I’m assuming they are somehow related. Minutes; possibly sub 60 secs.
What if i just like heroin.Senna's been used for over a thousand years for constipation. Just like oxycontin they took something that had been around for a while, changed it a bit and made a metric shit ton of money. Oh yeah and fighting in court so nobody could porduce their own version of the OG80 and left us with the OPs and NEOs yeah thanks purdue.  The drugs are produced by other companies than purdue all they do are patent and strangle the market.They are also co-promoting Symproic, which has a mechanism specifically for OIC.

But they aren't marketing it directly to consumers, cuz whoops we caused an opiate epidemic so gotta be carefulSo true lol..This!  I'm also the media and I agree. It definitely made the news, it’s been removed and apparently the gallery owner connected to the piece has been arrested and charged with both a misdemeanor and a felony. 

Here’s the link to the story. 

[link](http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story.html) Either you clearly don't use OC or you've literally never thought about your pills beyond ROA hahahaI hope they drop it down to like a littering charge so he doesnt catch a felony (if not just dropping it completely... Obv. that would be ideal.)

Instead theyll probably charge him with slandering the good name of our corporate overlords and have him executed for high treason. We probably should have just left it there and only claimed credit online... could have been out of the state by the time the police showed up.  Then arrange via phone to "have it removed" in a week or 2.The article OP linked says that the misdemeanor was for blocking their automotive pull-in area. Probably misdemeanor vandalism, could be littering, or one of those really broadly written laws like “disturbing the peace.”

Felony vandalism usually has to have a certain amount of property damage associated (like breaking stuff, or graffiti) and there’s not really any damage here. I wanna meet the dboy that will say nah to Godzilla. What is with people here not thinking Purdue is at fault. They single handled changed how doctors prescribed meds and did TONS of shady shit. They intentionally lied to sell pills and made billions. If my drug dealers can be held responsible then so should they. Only the OGs, unfortunately. Which we can't get here in the states anymore. At least not at a pharmacy. Kinda the opposite of hate the sin, love the sinner. This guy gets addiction. /sThey literally said it wasn’t addictive. They told doctors to prescribe it based on lies. 

It’s the same as big tobacco knowing cigarettes cause cancer and hiding it from the public. ## FDA requesting comment on opioid script crackdown hurting pain patients follow link and comment.

You can post anonymously. The FDA director has acknowledged that the misguided crackdown on legal/legitimate opioid scripts is going to far and hurting chronic pain patients.

[https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621)

They are requesting public comments on how this has impacted your or your families life. If you have chronic pain and have lost jobs, become suicidal, or turned to heroin because your prescriptions were taken away for absolutely no good reason other than the DEA and Sessions threatening doctors and pharmacists that are just trying to care for people..YOU NEED TO POST!!

Taking away people's in pains prescription's is inhumane, and it is doing absolutely nothing to stem the flow of heroin/fent into the USA, in fact its promoting it.username checks out..While demand is certainly there, you're right, a big part of the stigma and problem comes from drug diversion. If no one with a script EVER sold their pills for a profit, the problem woulsnt be as bad. There's enough blame to go around for the doctor and prescribed patient. You can't buy what no ones sellingTheir faces were the same as any other day.  You think they actually cared?His message is blaming Purdue and big pharma for over producing and lobbying for oversubscribing, causing the opiate crisis we are in now. Although many of us are addicts on this sub, we don't support addiction, and hope we all can find a way to lead happy healthy lives, whether that be with drugs or not.But it's still under patent and will be for quite some time. Thank Bayer.Well yeah, of course Purdue didn't invent senna, they just marketed and branded senokot. Aleve didn't invent naproxen, etc. Indeed oxycodone was invented in Germany in 1916. It was actually originally thought to be a non-addictive alternative to heroin. But they quickly worked out it wasn't even back then.

All Purdue did was stick a time release on it, get a patent for that, lie about its addictive potential, and cash in on overprescription.We are all the media this blessed dayare you fucking kidding me, a felony for leaving an art piece out in public? Can we at least pretend like we still have a fair justice system and only charge him with the misdemeanors that he would have been charged with had he left this in front of a business less wealthy and influential?Wow really shows you who's in charge. That's sad. Well, I'm from Maryland. If you know Md, then you know we have to drive through Delaware, where a lot of Perdue chicken farms are when we visit the beach. I goto the beach a lot. 

I used to fuck with OC but now I fuck with fent and regular dope. I really only use fent now because it doesn't show up on my drug tests in my drug program as long as I don't use 24 hours before. My dealer swears up and down its undetectable, but I still give it 24 hours and pass each time.It will be bargained down, also Pharma will drop the charges.The article says that the felony was for refusing to remove it. The gallery owner stood and chatted with police while waiting for the summons, but refused to remove it.  This was calculated though. He and the artist had already decided ahead of time but he was going to take the criminal charges.He knew what he was getting himself into, but he’s passionate enough about this that he wanted to send a message.i blame the mental health crisis and the gov't not doing enough to address itI only ever had the change to try one once, it was only half so 40mg shot.  at least i can say i tried the original OCs.  My friend that i taught how to shoot up was the one that split it with me.  Hes dead now from a fent/H od.  

alshtough he was the type of guy that would shoot 10 blues within the span of an hour so i pretty much knew it was gonna happen sooner or latter.Ok smart ass.  I just visit this sub cause I ran out of other things to read on the internet.Good example with Tabacco. It’s not that they made they product it’s that they lied in the interests of money with no care of the damage it may cause. thats the main issue, the misinformation that is spread like wild fire, worse than wild fire, it literally over takes peoples idea of what one thing is or is not, its like if you had an orange and a bullet, and they said "these are two oranges" and people where like "well the guy said its an orange so it must be...."  its a total fuck fest to say the least, but still, today, last 5-10 years, people need to talk responsibility for what they do, they know whats what when it comes to opiates, its been a mainstream thing for along time nowThats a huge part of it I still can't understand... so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades prior to OC's arrival, oxycodone, is somehow going to not be addictive due to them adding a time release coating!? I feel they cared mainly about getting all the perks for prescribing drugs for perdue that they overlooked the facts. Yeah but that also comes down to socio economic problems. I’ve know inter city poor people who sold their script because it was either they have there pain meds or they had a place to sleep and had to make a tough choice. Supply and demand.... and it almost just being normal human behavior. I mean we have been doing opiates for thousands of years... There will always be a demand and someone will supply it or find a way to get/make something hitting the same receptors..Who cares if they cared?

It's still awesome.They really don't care. Do U?Buprenorphine? The brand name patent is expired, there's plenty of generics....tons...History on point. A+Perdue deserves a little props for the new age heroin userThe felony charges won't stick. They can try to charge you with anything remotely similar to a broken law, doesn't mean any of that shit will stick. Probably get some 'illegal dumping' charge. The article explains it a little bit.

>	The spoon was placed in an automotive drop-off spot, making the path unusable. The placement of the sculpture was the misdemeanor charge; refusal to remove it resulted in the felony charge.

>	The interactions between Alvarez and police were cordial. While waiting to issue the summons, the gallerist and the cops chatted amiably about civic matters and the opioid epidemic.

>The sculpture, named “Purdue,” was made by Boston-based artist Domenic Esposito, who was present at the time of the sculpture drop. Esposito was not charged or arrested. He said before the art drop that he and Alvarez decided who would take the criminal charges.

I don’t know, that sounds kind of fair I guess. He knows what he was getting himself into by refusing to move it.  

Unfortunately it doesn’t matter if you’re fighting for a good cause, the downside of an illegal protest is that it’s illegal. They tend to make more headlines than organized legal protests, so in *that* way, they are more effective.  The legal consequences are just the price that you pay.  

The criminal charges actually do show that you are passionate enough about your cause to take a hit to spread awareness.  That definitely sends a message that gives fire to your movement.  All in all, even with the charges, I would imagine that he considers his protest a success.

Haha oh I know Perdue chicken to, its just with OC being about the most famous drug of all time, and Purdue being wildly notorious even amongst non drug users it's funny your mind went there. I meant no disrespect nor was I trying to imply you were an idiot for saying thatThis is the problem with things like this. There’s literally too many things that can be the cause of something. There are dozens of contributors. 

I need to look up the number but mental health is something we massively need to invest in. Every dollar we spend we save something like 3$ on incarceration. We can do so much more. We aren't monkeys in a cage. Feel free to browse this sub and comment all you want. But don't be surprised when you get called out on your "addiction is a choice" bullshit. > so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades...

[yes.](https://youtu.be/Er78Dj5hyeI) Right... sorry but if someone put a big azz H spoon outside your HQ the reaction would be priceless.and that’s why suboxone exists Wait, so what's his point exactly though? Do people really think the opioid epidemic is the fault of pharmaceutical companies? 

I can understand how non-users might think that, but for people familiar with addiction it just seems... naive.hahha my mind is just on the beach and I have to go by perdue farms when I go there. I wasn't trying to imply you were being disrespectful haha. But I am an idiot either way lolThis 'opioid epidemic' a good portion (maybe majority?) of these people are self-medicating with opiates for an untreated psych. issue because our mental healthcare system has failed themJust stop. So everytime you get high its been against your will? Developing an.addiction isn't a choice butnusing the drugs that lead to that addiction is a choice. Saying its.not takes all the responsibility off the addict and encourages them to.pmay the victim. People will never get clean with that mindset. Ive been there. I shot up heroin for 5 years. I get it. I.made a choice to stick that needle in my arm. I also made a choice to stop.Absolutely.  Oh to have been able to see *anyone's* reaction to it would have been so, damn amazing.

Someone say spoon?overprescribing opiates, which big pharma lobbied for A LOT, is the main reason for the opioid epidemic. Most heroin addicts today started on pills. The companies purposefully did little to nothing to detect fraud and misuse of their product. They marketed and produced them in ways that caused more addiction potential. They only started making them non-injectable in response to pressure from society. Its fucked up.I believe that my addiction is my own fault. However Purdue is very much at fault for allowing the supply of pills. Just like I don’t blame heroin addiction on the cartel I choose to pick up that bag but they should still be held responsible for their end. 

Mainly what Purdue did wrong was aggressively advertise to doctors that they had an extremely safe low addiction potential product. Which the data they used to support this was fabricated. There aggressive advertising didn’t just push their product but they supplied entire literature  for classes centered around managing pain. They changed they way in which doctors thought to treat pain which heavily relied on opiates. And whether or not you believe this is a good medical  decision know that they didn’t do this for pain patients but rather to sell more product. 

What they did was sketchy and bad in so many areas. Ultimately the addict needs to be responsible for their choices but so do the suppliers for actively making money while  deceiving doctors and the public 
This is an excellent piece that paints a clear picture of Purdue Pharma and the “Opioid Crisis” they created, through means of subversion, lobbying, targeting poor communities and paying doctors to lie-in order to get Oxycontin into the hands of millions of trusting patients, desperate for relief from chronic pain. 

Fm the Article in the New Yorker, ‘Empire of Pain:’
“According to training materials, Purdue instructed sales representatives to assure doctors—repeatedly and without evidence—that “fewer than one per cent” of patients who took OxyContin became addicted.”

*sorry for format-on shit mobilePriceless to see those greedy CEO big wigs no doubtI’d much rather regulated companies flat out sell opioids to addicts then forcing them on the black market to buy unknown..[This article](http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/) is really good too.

Oh and [this one](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/) about Purdue's current expansion into developing markets like China: "we're only just getting started."

Funny thing, even though the UK is not exactly a developing market it's also not really been a target market for Purdue since the NHS is much stricter about scripting opiates than the US healthcare system, but recently Shorttec and Longtec scripts have suddenly gone up and they've become available on the black market too. Those are brand names for oxycodone. The company that makes them is called Qdem. The parent company of Qdem is Mundipharma. The parent company of Mundipharma is Purdue. Agreed. But they can’t lie to everyone saying the opiates cause addiction in less than 1% of cases. Then when it is proven they lied they should pay 

But agreed the way things were in the pill mill days were much safer than they are now Yeah that is the real ethical problem imo. I think many of us can agree the war on drugs is a failure. Regulated markets are better than black markets.

However, selling drugs to druggies who know what they're getting into is different from lying to patients about how dangerous a medicine is.

People trust doctors, and corruption by Purdue lead to this trust being abused. A lot of people got hooked on opiates because doctors acted like pushers and those people would not have gone anywhere near smack otherwise. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😂, Content: , ups: 914, downs: 0Hahaha good one. My old ass hates itit wasn’t the 90’s, but when i was a senior in high school in 2008, i was doing oxy 80’s (the old, better ones that u could just break up so easily) and even sometimes i could get the old 160 mgs. anyways, that and opana and everything else. then one day my friend got some fent patches and was like just suck on this patch. i was like “that sounds retarded, sucking on a piece of paper to get well”. now look at me 10 years later, literally putting pieces of suboxone paper under my tongue everyday. lol.YIKES!I literally love this post. It finally makes me feel understood, and included. I’m a young, newer opiate user who started with fentanyl less than a year ago, and it ruined classic opiates for me. I never got to enjoy oxys or heroin.Golden �Haha funny and trueThis is a good oneBahahaha ���..                   nm.Fentanyl is a damn good painkiller. I would love to be put on a patch.i love this memeYeah I miss that era of my use too. Around 2007-2011. Back when I could semi afford a pill habit of OC, dilaudid and oxynorphones. For some reason too no one ever knew how cheap they were selling the dilaudids and opanas and would get them cheap as fuck like .10-.25 bucks a mg. Even OC was very max .50 a mg and that was like full retail price.That fuckin sucks homie !This is what pisses me off when people want to show off their drug dick and brag how they went straight to snorting heroin or IVing right off the bat in their opiate consuming career.

&#x200B;

Its DUMB, noobs should start with codeine or tramadol because if you go straight to the hardest shit your tolerance is ruined, you miss out on that honeymoon period where you can use cheaper easier to find shit occasionally.

&#x200B;

Its like joining some public bisexual orgy for your first sexual experience, its dumb! Enjoy the small things first.I feel bad for you.i think i used to pay like $10 for an 80mg when i’d buy them in bulk back then. but then it went up to $15, then $20, then finally $25. by then i had moved on to H and then methadone. I had to go to a methadone clinic basically every day. that shit sucked after a while. It’s nice how easy it is to get suboxone prescribed where i live now, especially if u really need it. but honestly, i totally miss how cheap and simple things were back in those days.Yeah, it really does suck for people who can’t enjoy it the way I do. I have such a romantic love for fentadope bags ��Um, somebody offered me what they had. What, was I supposed to tell them to go fetch me oxys? Shits are expensive, I’m not about to be picky about free drugsI agree. I started on codeine and got a good high on 15mg. I spent a year climbing the codeine ladder until it did jack. Then I went onto oxycodone. Nearly 3 years later, 10mg is still a decent dose that’ll help pain. I’d probably need 20mg to get high.I don’t. Oxys are so fucking expensive.Nah bro it sucks that you started up using in the era of Fentalogues... Fentanyl doesn’t hold a candle to Oxymorphone, at least not for me... with fent it always felt like a short lived body load with not near as much euphoria. To each their own I guessYou got high on 15mg of codeine?My first opiate experience was IVing hydromorphone, I think it was something like 3-4 mg. Needless to say it blew away so hard. That first rush experience with the best rush opiate of any is amazing. But now I don’t really enjoy anything else except maybe some decent H if I can get my hands on some ( very rarely). 

Here in Eastern Canada the most common opiate and by far the most available is hydromorphone, it’s hard to find anything else.

I agree with what you said however. I wish I had started with Oxys or something and worked my way up like a normal junkie ruining her life. 

It’s hard to pass the needle once you know how it feels and how easy it is to prepareDidn’t used to be. I was getting a 100 pack of blueberries in 2008 for 320$. OC80s you could get 50 for 300 and this was even cold copping prices in the major north western city. 

When I heard roxi 30s were fucking 30-45$ street price now I couldn’t believe who would pay that when you could get a gram of good heroin for that price, that was 2012ish. Oxymorphone and gel fent patches kinda fucked up the game and then the crack down, and reload of really good cheap dope. 

Now Good luck getting dope without a RC in it, and it’s like 80/g. I was getting fingers of Fire ECP for 260 as recently as 2017 

Been off opiates since 2017 so i could potentially be unaware of somethingI agree with you wholeheartedlyI no joke dreamed about oxymorphone last night. Christ I miss itI loved popping ten oxycodone and being lit for a day.Yeah, but it’s not like I know what I’m missing. It’s just a generation gap. I’d love to try dillies and pandas, but they’re so expensive in comparison. And short legs is advantageous. I’ve survived so many overdoses, and I can get high anytime, because I’m sober within the hour.Initially, yes. It was more like a buzz.I pay $140 for a bundle of “heroin” which is just bags of fentadope that I love. I’ll mAre you yeezusWow, livin the dreamAh right, you must metabolize it really well. I'm at the stage where i'm taking 500mg or so daily, and it doesn't do shit anymore. Gonna have to get on the dark net and find something better i suppose.Yeah, just like the rest of you opiate addicts on here.Definitely the dream lmao�[removed]Get off your high horse m8

Edit: Relevant UsernameThanks for the advice dude, i'd take every precaution if I started getting stuff on the dw, the risk is what keeps me away.We don't allow specific markets or vendors to be named here.What high horse? I’m not allowed to enjoy my own god damn drug of choice without having everybody talk shit about it, saying “oh that sucks for you”It is so funny that a subreddit of fucking heroin addicts can't let someone do whatever the fuck they want.  Actually hilarious how delusional they are, you do you bro.  Be safe. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Revenge Hack, Content: , ups: 905, downs: 0No no no, destroy your life with drugs, feign getting clean, get your ex-back, relapse and ruin both of your life's..... Bonus points if you can trick your ex to get on dope after the relapse.Damn, this made me sad. Y’all hang in there. You can beat the pain. Seems impossible, but I promise it is not. Hahahaha �That's what I did to Church Girl. [deleted]Dam this hits home :’(Damn this turned out to be way more controversial than it should have been. Genius Fuck! I relate to this to much!It’s unfortunately meDam this hits close, my drug use got pretty fucking bad when my ex broke up with me I can’t imagine what a divorce would do to meHAHAHA REKTTTTI am one step ahead of youThis happened to me lolToo relatable lolYes because people who take drugs are really beneath contempt, let's keep that trope going. Can we have a bit more racism and sexism in here as well, please?noIt was just a joke dudeWhile I agree, pretty sure all of us know this already. Therefore it's a bizarre and funny joke.LolYou’re a beast metroFeel for you dude been in that same boat at least twice In society, they absolutely are. Whether you like that or not, that’s the truth. So I’m not sure why your point is here. No. No it’s not. The joke is, it’s not a joke ...The point being that we ought to make the attempt to understand why people take drugs instead of persecuting them. That's difficult and expensive and it's the same reason why mental health provision in general is so poor. Great advances have been made in the field of physical health but mental health lags significantly. It remains a taboo subject amongst suffers, nobody is declaring that they have mental health issues, you would be unemployable at the very least.You don't seem to understand what the phrase "beneath contempt" means. You just agreed that addicts are beneath contempt. You are trying to express that society *sees* addicts as *worthy of contempt.* Yeah, it is. It’s about revenge. They’re using it as way to get back at the person who dumped them. The joke being that it’s a very extreme length to go to just to get revenge on that person. Ummm, do you get it?Funny... I still laughedPerhaps the best way to bring attention to the subject is with comedyR/wooooshI think you're just shitfaced, sir. Do you get it dude? Lol That is usually a very effective tool.Perhaps a meme even??I kinda feel like the exact same thing should be said to you lolI was being sarcastic though lolShould have added an /s cause nothing about the way your comment comes off sounds in any way sarcastic at all...You are getting downvoted lol, it was a sarcastic comment on how yes it’s staged as a joke but it has real life altercations to people a lot of the time. Lmao lol I’m getting downvoted - by you - 2 downvotes. Oh no, better close my account!
See, THATS sarcasm � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I did a thing!, Content: , ups: 903, downs: 0I used to be an active member of the opiates community. I was on opiates for 10 years, IV heroin at the end of it. From a low bottom hopeless homeless rotten scumbag like me, it truly does get better. Shoutout dejaGood work man. I'm day 29 and spazzing tf out. Cant quit thinking about dope.Congratulations!  You're one strong willed person.  I wish you the best in your future endeavors!  Fucking love me some Brand New. �������������Congratulations!!! That is great news to see someone succeed. Awesome.I'm only at 5 months man haha, congrats. Takes some real will power.Amazing! How'd you do it!? 

&#x200B;Congrats fam. 8 months hereIs that image from déjá entendu?Coming from someone who is mostly a lurker around here and a momma of an addict who lost his battle in June...... I have tears in my eyes when I tell you how happy and excitedI am for you!!!  I wish for you a beautiful life. Congratulations I'm nearly 10 months, and you're my inspiration. Your phone background helps.1000 days and approx $40k in savings... you did remember to put all your would-be dope money in a savings account, didnt you? 




I know I sure didnt. Congrats dood. Congratulations! I’m very happy for you. Wow that’s amazing, I wish I had your strength. You just gave me the inspiration to resist my craving for the night. HOLY MOLY MACKEREL CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!Brand New?Iv been on opiates for 13 years now mainly methadone, im so tied of this feeling i just want my life back. Im reducing so hopefully next year will be the year i get off it fingers crossed.Love your wallpaper. Congrats! Congratulations!Contrary to my username, Daisy is actually one of my favorite albums of all timeWord my favorite bandUhm, what’s that app you’re using? And looks cool, only thing that Bothers me is how the white font on the bottom kind of blends in with the background a bit. Congratulations! ��This is a big step to reach.  Hopefully you can convince others to 
join you.
Great work dude! Proud of you for this feat!Congrats. Legit having that deja entendu art tattooed on my leg in two weeks Dolor hic proderit olim. <3What app is this Congratu-fucking-lations
It's always good to see people who have pulled out of this. Gives me inspiration I might as well someday.You got out just as fent was about to get really bad. That decision might have saved your life!Congrats. Going on 9 months here. You are truly an inspiration!Your one of the best in my book! I'd rather hire a guy like you who has been through hell and comeback alive then 100 other guys that have had an easy go. God Bless you man. Congrats...I used to work with a guy who was a ex-heroin addict. Now he runs a multi-million dollar company and brings in north of 500k /year home.Oh man. 2 years since I touched fentanyl. Overdoses... Dying from withdrawal seizures and dehydration.

I still feel like ass,but I feel way better. Went to rehab and everything. I couldn't do anything I wanted to die, but I got put in some psychiatric hospital because I told the doctor that. 

2 years later I'm better. All started with taking my grandma's vicodin (she didn't use them or wanted to, she threw them and I took it) don't know why she'd buy them anyways. You can deny a script. 

Then to Norco, oxy, tar heroin... Fent (first hit, OD) and continued fent for months despite almost dying. 


And these DEA. FDA people wanna get rid of Kratom but not shit like vicodin that dentist tried to give me but I refused and felt good about it.

Kratom basically is like a weak opiate feel but it's different. It's energetic for me. When I stop, I can still function. I just get stomach issues.

Not saying to try kratom either in just mad cause I've been informed about the lies FDA and shit are spreading.

Well, congrats to staying clean.Blessings to you! ��Thank you brother. May life bless youI was lucky enough to see them do the devil and god all the way through in 2016 before the shit hit the fan. Deja still has a big place in my little grinch heart though. It started getting better for me around 60 days. Once I got over that hump everything started making sense. Up until then, though, it was nearly constant. I was lucky, I got to go to long term treatment. AmenDon’t say “only” - give yourself some credit! I’m sure it took work to get there. Slowlyyyyyyyy. No but for real I went to a 90 day treatment program, a halfway house, and lived at a sober living house for 15 months before I let myself experience the real world. I’m an active member of AA and have a home group, sponsor, and good friends who support me. It is I’m very sorry to hear about your son. It’s not the same but I lost my best friend in July and can’t imagine what it would be like to lose a child. Occasionally a using thought will pop into my head and the first person I think of is my mom. Again, I’m so so sorry for your loss. Back when I was active I used to kind of idolize you; it’s an honor to be on the other side. If I had saved it all I’d have over a hundred grand according to the app. Unfortunately I don’t have that much but I have a positive balance in my account and a paycheck that keeps coming every two weeks with no threat of being taken away anytime soon!Yes sir or ma’am It’s called Sober Time. I picked the background photo so you could always choose something that fits better with the whiteSober Time, you can choose your own background photo Oh believe me, it did. I overdosed on fentanyl three times in one week before I stopped. Girl, but thank you all the same! I work in the treatment field now and it’s really cool getting to help people like me. Goddamn, think about how much heroin he could buy.I’m a girl! But thank you all the same. Saw that same tour with modern baseball and tfb  that show was epic came to see if anyone recognized the background, and quickly my heart sank after reading this comment because i’d sell my kidney to see the devil & god are raging inside me live. fuck id kill to see them live at all but now i sadly probably never will � (still clinging to hope they’ll someday soon at least do a reunion tour)I also saw their anniversary tour in 2016 where they played the whole record! At the time I was disappointed there was no new record for the show, but TDAG is my all time favorite album and seeing it front to back live was basically a religious experience for me.

And I got to see them play science fiction the next year anyways :)Thanks, I appreciate the kind words.Glad to hear it bro-  thats a solid gameplan and I'm a big advocate of sober living/halfway. Well thank you.  As my heart heals I intend to find ways to honor him and get his story out there.  It can be so discouraging but then there are stories like yours that remind me that there can be freedom and there are happy endings.  Keep killing it.  You are awesome Who is he that you idolized him? I recognize the user name but is there something I’m missing, like is he internet famous or something? Lol This is inspiring and priceless, really. Congratulations to you and keep up the positive attitude and hard work ~ you're doing so well!I have that astronaut tattooed all over my arm!Love your choice! It’s Daisy and Deja, right?!how do you help?Lol.... I think.Is it bad that was my first thought, probobly but whatever.That’s the one! I went to the show in CT. I feel the saaaameYou just learn who certain people kind of are when they have a recognizable username and post here often. Sometimes to the point of feeling like you know someone.I do intakes and admissions and I’m a counselor internIt's your cake day, you're allowed to think bad thonks on cake day.Haha same me tooI was going to respond but you got it. Exactly this. how did you get into it?YES!Nice. That venue was really cool. A couple of my friends from my old home group have various jobs at the rehab I work at, and once I had 2 years and a spot opened up they let me know and I went for it!Yeah the oak dale is pretty nice. Congrats on getting clean man, big ups to you When I was in an in-house detox for heroin, the people who helped the most were the counselors who had been addicts. They didn't miss a thing and I still remember their advice. They were a million times more spot on than the psychiatrist who you hardly ever saw anyway.

Well done and good for you helping others. No one is more qualified. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Yuh, Content: , ups: 891, downs: 0One time this dude asked me to swing by to drop off, but his family was visiting his house. Ok no prob, I said, I'll just leave it on top of the tire of your car or in your bushes. I pull up a there's an old man literally right outside staring at the street?? I park in front of the next house on the street, the old man is his dad who went outside to make a phonecall. I'm thinking okay lmao now what, so I get out of the car and shove the shit up the neighbor's rain pipe on the side of their house, get in my car and look up and see the neighbor in their fucking living room staring out the windows, behind the blinds, at me. I tell the guy where I left it and gtfo lmao"So this is the friend we've heard so much about... Like a plate? The wings are hot off the grill!

You want what, exactly? All flats? 

*slowly begins scratching head*

Flats... coming right up... Excuse me moment, if you would."

*walks inside, unlocks phone*

"Ok Google, what part of the chicken is flat?"






Sooo like all Dominicans & puerto ricans in the boston area? haha

Shit bro.. I’m puerto rican and i think its hilarious. dumb assess stick out like sore thumbs Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent 'ya! Damn spitting imagine of one of my dudes lmao. And he would do that too hahahaha.Ill always upvote dipsetOr when u pull up to meet ur plug and he has a custom bright ass burn-ur-retina paint job w/26" sprewell's... "I'm sure no one knows what just went down bro.... We r good".. lolThe whole byrd gangs in here AYI would rock this get up.Holy fuck I copped a few grams at a quinceanera one time. Was the only white dude, was hilarious. its funny cuz i pretty sure julez just got in trouble for gun and 8 blue berrys in his bag when he was trying to catch a flight. 
Its all fun and games until your uncle walks up to the plug and they know each other lol So pathetic, needing to buy your next high while at a family cookout. Free max b[deleted][deleted]What’s flat?Wait wait, who fucking grills flats and drumsticks? If youre grilling wings they better be whole from rib to tip and slathered in chiavettas, if theyre broken down you should be frying them like mama bellisimo intendedMy Lawrence dboys �Shit I wish Juelz was my dealer. Thats correct, saw it on NORE's show.Never understood drug dealers like that. Either don't respond or give an accurate time frame wtf is the point of lying or being annoying if it's someone trying to give you their moneyOh no cuz if it’s bunk you’re just trying to get free shit! Lol I had one dealer I guess who would always talk shit behind my back. Look I know a lot of people let you short them and fuck them over but I have never been that chick. I’ll say something every fucking time til I’m going somewhere else. 

It’s extra awesome when they think you need them. And when you haven’t seen them all weekend they’re calling you asking if “you alright.” Psht too late bitch!So true!!The flat part of the wing...not the drumstick aka the best part!Chiavettas! I see you're from the East coast.Caspar MilquetoastI got into a heated fight with a woman who was middling for me over this. She would always tell me she had what I needed, but after 6 hours of dicking me around it would become clear that she never had it, and she was just trying to string me along until she had it. She was desperate for her cut of the dope.

Another kid I bought from for a while straight up told me, "you've gotta make em wait to remind the customers of their place". Fuck that guy.Because if they say they arent ready you will just look somewhere elseQft!!!   I have a guy that delivers and I'll call at 5pm,me- "yo dude, can u roll thru?". Him-"Yup, I'm just going to stop get some gas and Ill that way"
Me-"ok bro thx, I appreciate it". Hr and a half later, I call back, me-" hey man just making sure ur still rolling thru" 
Him-" yup I got u, I'm heading that way now".  He lives about 15/20mins away. It's now 715, I text- "u getting close by?? "Him- yup passing ##### street now omw".  It's now 8:20, I hit him back one more time, he answers sounding aggrevated, "yeah",. Me-"just making sure u are still coming this way?". Him- " I told u I'm omw". Just about perfectly the amount of time it takes for him to get to me from his crib from then he shows up.  I mean fuck I've even tried to b like yo man can u roll thru, I'll grab my regular.. and if u can't get here for a lil it's cool, just lmk... Naw man, I'll b there asap...3-1/2 hrs later, he shows... On the bright side, allot of times he "hooks it up" for making me wait.... So I know he understands the concept of time... Apparently just doesn't grasp the idea of conveying that info my way...I've had about a dozen solid connects, and that theme holds true for every one of them!I know this isn the same but when I was selling nug in college and I remember when I started I would be super punctual and give people accurate time frames because I mean the shit sells itself you just roll through and grab the cash. After a year or so I remember getting super lazy about it and would get annoyed when people would hit me up all the time.  It was mostly annoying when these people I wasn’t friends with hit me up and I had to drop what I was doing. I can imagine selling harder drugs the people annoy you more and the hours are even more fucked. Then I got hooked on dope and I guess karma happened cuz I had such a SHITTY middle until I got introduced to my boy running a trap. [deleted][deleted]It's a way to keep you from going to the backup dope boy. I'l lbe there in 5 keeps you from going somewhere else Seriously...dont they want to make money??I had a dealer who I would weigh his product every time cause his runners were dumbasses who skimmed bags every once in a while and he loved that I told him when it was weak or missing even like .05 on a quarter. He would always replace product missing taking my word for it (since I actually never lied amazingly enough) and if it was fucked up stuff where maybe the runner cut it he would throw me extra too usually "uncut". Best dealer I ever had, got to watch him move up from running around in his beat up subey with his gf to having 3-5 runners making bank so he always treated me well. [deleted][deleted]I didn’t know that was what it was called but the flat is my favorite part. Yeah, baby!Yup, and more meat too. Western NY, i know my wings.I've heard the remind the junkie of their shit place in the world before and was blown away. Like really your gonna play the holier than thou card dealing dope?[deleted]Fine then, look somewhere else if you want to pay more rather than wait, but I know they'll be back eventually. I always try to work in the customers best interest, and if that interest is someone else selling for double my price then so be it lmfao At least he comes through. Today for example we spoke at 11:45 I call at 4:45, twice and get chewed out for “blowing him up while he’s doing family shit”. & then says he’s turning off his phone after me trying to explain that there’s no way I could know that. Um excuse me, then why did u say u were on the way at 11:45.... fucking ridiculous. I HATE every dboy I know it’s pathetic. All depends on his mood.Yeah it's annoying, especially since I work crazy long, weird hours at a real job too, but st the end of the day I remember that money is money, and I need money.Damn. Where do you live that does deliveries? If someone's gonna go low enough to roll on one of their dealers to try and escape the consequences of their own fuck-up, wouldn't they rather roll on one of their less reliable dealers rather than their #1 connect?I'm lowkey enough already that there's no way anyone is gonna roll up my name tbhI don't really care if they end up going to someone else tbh lmao. I already know I've got the cheapest, if you'd rather pay double the price for someone who's just gonna yank your chain for 5 hours like everyone else rather than wait 3 hours for me to get off work and serve you promptly then uhh that's your choice lolThey always do, but sometimes you let your personal feelings of being inconvenienced and annoyed of being taken out of something you're currently doing get in the way. The bigger you are the more likely you are to get those feelings That’s fucking awesome, you the real OG my dude!shit most the h aint even real h these days... its all chemicals and bullshit. Theyd rather mix 10 different analogues together and call it h then just get some real h... seems like a much bigger hassle having to acquire all that shit but I guess they just blinded by profit margins sadly. Sucks cuz all the old heads who actually care about running a good business and keeping custies happy are all leaving the game or dying off leaving all these idiots who only see dollar signs to take their place and the product goes from being 7/10 or better all day to, "lets play who can guess whats in my dope and how strong it is today..." ranging from bunk to OD. Brap brap! Can't say specific locations but I'm living quite near a place famous for wings.It's really troubling how high and mighty a little power over others makes some people.It’s hilarious to me how so many of them act like they are your lifeline. Don’t forget bitch, you’re working for me! You don’t come correct, I’m gone. And then of course if they haven’t seen you all week they’re asking where you are. I hired someone else mofo peace! 

Ugh you know last week I drove my connect who is on house arrest to see his P.O. this mother fucker had the nerve to say to me after driving for 2 hours “I’m on a time limit, you ain’t!” Excuse the fuck out of me? I have a life and that whole not respecting my time but demanding me to respect yours, that don’t fly with me. Haven’t seen his bitch ass since. I really cannot stand those types. Hate to break it to you, but I really don’t need your ass.Damn you sound like such a cool person! I wish you were my connect.This is true, I have 3 on rotation just for those occasions..lol. let's c how long they get irritated for calling them back hrs later when we stop calling em back:).Exactly, i don't know where unRare lives but where i'm at if you're a piece of shit you get flipped, if you're good and give extras though, credit and all that, nobody even dreams of talkingI completely agree with Project.  If the guy is gonna rat I think he gives up the connect that treats him the worstYeah that'd be really fucking stupid for anyone to roll on whoever has the lowest prices. Roll on the one with the highest with the shittiest product lmfao Dude no if u ppl just keep ur mouths SHUT when/if u ever get caught up and either comply with the police or have a sure way to escape, u will all get into less trouble duh cuz u want at least evidence against u as possible.  They can’t just go on ur phone but need to have a passcode on it and I’ve been charged with 4 sales/etc felonies a few years ago and got caught with over 50 gs of h and a bunch of different other shit, 4 phones, 2 scales but I kept my friggin mouth shut and it all got dropped after about a year and a half.  This was in Cali tho and I did have a private attorney Maybe I'm the only one who has had paranoid, rude connects. I agree it's silly, the reason I got sober was because how annoyingly hard it was to score good dope. Routinely waiting hours in my car after getting a location. You got it right though, just find that rare in my part. Poppin' OCs from the Florida pill mills and shooting real dope for 10 years without a taste of fent til just last month when I relapsed. I feel like an old man in a young persons game now. Getting back on track right now with a week clean. I don't think I can survive any longer but I have the motivation to stay clean even if it's just cause I want to be able to tell those youngsters about the good ol' days in the opi game. Same here. Of course all the famous places have crappy wings ;)Just look at Reddit mods anyplace but here lol. Or HOAs. Or mall rent a cops. Anything with the slightest hint of power can go straight to a mofos headTheres more than one popsicle stand in town. See I feel like once I get a little older and don’t have like real responsibilities and shit that I’m probably gonna just completely go Head first. My bf and I will sell our house, buy a tiny house, and travel and get high lol. Who knows, I just feel like if I’m in a good place I will probably fuck it all up.

And shit, you get clean for any damn reason you want! Lol gosh I really couldn’t imagine how much different shit is now compared to them. I know a lot of people get fent but personally where I’m at it’s pretty scarce luckily. Of course the dope is most likely not as good as it was when you were on your run, but I do love me some tar. Whatever you choose to do, I hope life treats you well! Much love!!I feel you and wish sometimes for that but there would still be sick days and my family would hate me and I'd pick up more felonies and I'd hit a hot shot and die. Luckily my real run was all powder cause just in my little relapse my veins have failed me from the tar. Hope whatever path you choose treats you well and maybe some day you'll want to get clean and if not just please be careful and don't die on us. Love right on backI’m lucky enough to be 5 years in and still not on the needle. I’ve been completely functioning, but my boyfriend has been using weekends and in the last couple months he’s really lost control. So I guess it’s time to quit. I’ve never let heroin take anything from me, but just in the last 2 weeks every single bill has been completely behind now. Worries me, that’s for sure! Would hate to have a drug ruin my relationship but I’ve never been the type to lose it all for a substance. Luckily I’ve been able to maintain some sort of control.

And I think you’re doing the right thing. Losing your family I’m sure is horrible, so definitely keep up how you’re going. Good luck fam! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: The real MVP, Content: , ups: 885, downs: 0It is illegal for them to open your mail without a warrant, (UPS and fed ex can open if they have reasonable suspicion, although average employees cant open them, they just send them up the chain). If they happen to break open and there are drugs everywhere or obviously visible, then they will send it to their security department and give it to the police. 

I worked for UPS as a manager at one of the largest hubs in the country and have good friends at the post office. We covered this kind of shit in my management training and the head of security for our hub, (who is a corparate higher up dude), told us that the major mail carriers know that they ship millions upon millions of dollars worth of drugs every year and its not really an issue for them. I mean at the end of the day, thats lots of money for them and its not their responsibility to determine if the packages are legal or not.... They, (and the feds) are way more worried about illegal guns or bombs etc. 

In my years with UPS I personally found illegal drugs once, moved around pharmaceutical drugs almost every day, (unfortunately they watch those packages like hawks) and I have seen and heard about a few larger busts too. And seen a lot of other crazy shit in the mail too. Its pretty crazy what people mail around. Honest question, what happens if the package accidentally gets opened on the way to you? I had totally innocent packages that arrived with the Box sort of torn open, I couldn't imagine what would happen if that would have been an illicit substance...

Can you just claim you didn't know it was going to arrive at your house?  That somebody else sent it to you? Or is that just part of the risk?LOVE this one Wish I was smart enough to figure out how to order them online....but with a prison G.E.D education, I'm pretty sure I'm shit outta luck ever trying to figure it out myself lolDo most people here get stuff from dark net? I've always contemplated it, but just wouldn't be worth the risk to me.
You dumbasses need to stop blowing this shit up. Will you ever get over it? Keep it to yourself. This is the type of shit the DEA displays in powerpoint presentations to their boss when attempting to get funding for dw investigations. You're just fucking yourselves. The less you talk about it, the better off everyone will be.Halleluyerrrr ��Made. My. Day. I get off on sering the mail truck in my neighborhood and think "fuck, he's got an envelope full of fent locked in there and he's going to come to me!? Too kind, sir. Too kindAnd for that, we thank you.It's crushing when he doesn't come though and you know you'll have to wait another 24 long fucking hours���The “sentencing reform act” in 1984 eliminated it for crimes committed after 1987. Part of the get tough on crime bullshit. �������Im over here like MEH.... HAHAHA aintnobodygottimefodat!Trust me they know lol Give us a story mister!  Id love to hear some examples first handYou just deny everything, there's nothing linking you to the package so unless you admit to them what you did they can't do shit.Lol.    They have no clueIf it's packaged appropriately then there should be at least one more visual layer beyond the basic envelope. So, even if it accidentally rips open they shouldn't be able to see anything incriminating.Deny deny denyIt’s part of the risk, go find a vacant house and make sure you have a tracking #There’s some really in-depth guides. All you need is a card, a laptop, and a flash drive. What risk? If you use correctly and safely there is little to no riskIdk copping in the hood is part of the experience for me. It’s an adrenaline rush in and of it itself being somewhere so foreign to me. Like I grew up in a nice upper middle class neighborhood and I had a fucked up fascination with dealing with corner boys, figuring out what spots to go to for what drugs, learning how to navigate the hood without sticking out like an easy target. All in all it humbled me and made me realize people in “the hood” are just people too and everybody’s just trying to make a living.Its not perfectly safe, but as long as you order gram or less, its way safer than the streets. Better quality too.AMENNo, they don't..Alright, biggest one I have ever seen. So I was walking into work one day, and I go through security at the front gate and there is a cop car and a cop van out front. I'm like wtf is happening? 

Well I go to walk to out office for our prework meeting and you have to walk past this caged in area where they take all the contraband/broken or leaking shit to either fix it or hold it. The cops are there with the all the higher up people and security guys fucking around pulling packages out of these paint cans. One of the uniformed cops is there just chillin so I ask what they found, he says they dont know for sure yet but they did a field test on some of it and it was cocaine. So I peek over there and see that they have probably 10 boxes, each with 4 paint cans each and they are pulling just pack after pack out of each one. 

Idk how much it was in total, and it was weird because none of us saw anything about it on the news afterwards. But scuttlebutt says it was some coca, and there was pounds of the shit. 
 
Another time a guy on my shift that was a maintenance guy, (worked on the equipment and such) apparently was pretending to work on the belts near this load from a pharmaceutical distributor and would steal boxes off them to look for pills. Our head of security suspected him, so he literally hid inside a large box near there to catch him in the act. When he did they had the cops search him and his stuff, they found a bunch of oxy and bars, some victorias secret underwear and a dildo all that he admitted to stealing that day. This. Deny everything and in the worst case you gonna need a lawyer but deny everything and say you have no clue who sent that. Lmaoooo fuck yea I've read vacant houses are a bad idea. It's a pretty big red flag when you deliver a package to a location no one lives atThe best way to hide something is to make it as normal as possible.  A person who lives at a house the mailman delivers to regularly is the best.  My mailman stole a package that didn’t have tracking.  He was starting to catch on since I would literally hunt him down for packages; most people don’t care that much lol.  I miss Silk Road 1.0.  The fact of the matter is most people don’t want to make a scene and will just deliver even if they know.I'm looking at the Dark web guide for noobs on here, I'm trying to have it make sense to me. Still extremely new to reddit, only found it after searching for withdrawal cures on google lol. I will persevere, because I live in buttfuck KY and this would seriously come in handy A credit card? Wouldn't there be risk of a vendor just keeping the funds and mailing nothing?You had to “realize” that? Lol.   Well I’m glad u did.Mailmen are drug dogs in disguiseThank you fellow afficionado, i was deeply amused, but probably not as deeply as the maintenance worker's plans for that nightWAIT WHAT HE HID IN THE BOX LOLThe only person who can incarcerate you, is you. Definitely, mailmen know what houses on their route are vacant.Back in the 90s I used the mail all the time, I had a dude that was hooked up w.people south of the border,  he went to ASU. And would send 20#s of killer smoke right through the mail. Lol..I'd just give the people of the house like 100$ or like a QP of smoke..Just bout 4 years ago a guy I knew used the same method,  to a vacant house.He had a guy that lived next door to it,  to watch for the drop , Now, this guy knew the lady that owned it, and she had moved..And I guess she had mentioned renting it out, but didnt say when?
So, since there was no "For rent" sign , they figured the coast was clear..The day the Senders put the package (20#s of killer Dro) in motion. Guys showed up to start doing some renovating to update the house,  lol..Panic was setting in..Obviously this wouldn't look good if the neighbor comes over and grabs a package NOT addressed to him, and yes..it was addressed to the none suspecting neighbor,  an older , not hip, lady that looks nothing like this kinna shit would be going on around her, another reason the decision was made to do this btw..Once the package arrives , the mail LADY actually gets one of the working GUYS to get it since it's so fuckin heavy, lol..The whole thing is going down in front of my dude that's helpless, the package is then actually left outside until the home owner gets there, SO, my buddy gets a call from the watcher and is told he has to get it,  HE CAN'T,  hes held up,  whole other story,  lol..needless to say, the home owner gets it, opens it, and actually calls the cops to turn it in..Neighbors were questioned,  but obviously no one knew,except my dude and his friend..very costly for my dude,  very..You're right,  vacant houses are a no go. Not smart at all to do that. It’s definitely useful if you’re smart and careful with it. Just look at the reviews, rating, and other such factors. Escrow helps a lot as well as it pretty much guarantees arrival for your package. You want a withdrawal cure? Here you go!! It works and I never needed such a high amount as the guy who wrote this.

Edit/Update  -- why downvote me for sharing information that can help people? Smh. This works. I've done it for years and I am happy to talk to anyone about it.  

https://opiated.wordpress.com/2007/03/26/how-to-kick-a-habit-easily-with-zero-discomfort/Yeah you need one to buy crypto currency. BTC and LTC are the most commonly used ones, but I opt for LTC myself because bitcoin is ridiculously easy to track. [deleted]Bigger risks are at customs. Because most drugs on dnm get through international customs in multiple countries before getting to the actual destination, it can get seized by them. Yeah I mean when you’re young and people talk about the hood like it’s this scary place where everyone is a thug and you hear about people getting robbed and killed on the news it’s easy to feel like it’s another world.I seen some weird shit there but that dude takes the cake on the weirdness. I'm sure he threw some dope ass parties tho. 

I found a replica of longclaw (Jon snows sword from GOT) once too. It was sharp and sturdy so I promptly used it to chop a tote box in half before replacing it in the box. I was young and dumb but it felt really cool and amused some of my coworkers greatly. He was gonna have some real fun lmaoYes my dude. There's this area there where the belts all converge that they call the pit and thats where dude was chilling taking the shit off the belts cuz there isnt really anyone there. 

But yea, this security guy put a big ass empty box down there to hide in. Little eyeholes and everything. Dude takes his job super serious obviously. He sprang out and scared the fuck out of dude tooWhat they’ll likely do is put the package back together after cataloging and photographing everything in it and deliver it. Then they’ll watch you and the sender and build a better case and hopefully catch a bigger fish. If you have a habit of using the mail they’ll just intercept every delivery and do the same with them. And when they arrest you they can show a pattern. Good luck trying to deny it then. 

I have a friend who did ten years federal time for doing just this. And there is no parole in the federal system anymore. We had a what i will call STUPID AF mailman that INSISTED my house was vacant. He was new to the area granted but NOPE my house is empty apparently. So figure out your mailmans drug of choice and hook them up for dropping off at the same exact time every day.Am a mailman, can confirm. Holy Christ that is heartbreaking. Not gonna lie, would be tempted to run up on the lady in a balaclava and bounce.I went to asu and it led me to become a heroin addict for those 40$ g thru the Mexicans they didn’t even speak English just “negro, blanca, medio, grande?”

And when they picked up the phone you didn’t know who you were taking to. You just said your cross streets and when you got there just kind of looked around for some Mexican dudes riding together. Nothing out of the ordinary in tempe. They would wave you in the store. You go in they grab a polar pop, throw it in there, you put your money in an empty polar pop and


Switcheroo right when you walk outside you just switch cups. You got your shit no questions asked and they answered all day everyday. Why would he get it in a real persons name that doesn't know anything about it? That's pretty shitty thing to do, it's like the people that live with their parents and get drugs delivered to the house. Thanks for the tips, I appreciate it, although I'm slightly weary of detailed instructions online...wouldn't that be easy for the police to look up as well? And how do I even know it's not written by the Feds to catch idiots like me? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seems like a valid concernThis... Is simply not going to work for a lot of people. Methadone is full agonist opiate just like heroin and works on mu-opioid-receptors primarily, just like heroin--unlike the author said as the reason why the said three methadone dose detox works. You will most likely get right back to being sick as a dog about 24 hours after your third and last methadone dose.Not everyone has access to methadoneCould you explain or possibly tell me where to find a good explanation on how to buy LTC or BTC? I have no idea how any of that works Actually there are so many ways to get bitcoin without credit cards. As of now, I suggest bitcoin because it has the highest value, most recognized, and most stable compare to other crypto/digital currenciesBest to order from a supplier in your own country - no customs. What’s there’s no parole In fed r u sure Lmao, rightI’ve done that plenty of times while I lived with my parents. I just said it was something I bought off eBay for my car and I needed my friends help to install it so they didn’t question me when I put it in my trunk and left Feds very well know what’s going on. They really aren’t after you unless your bringing in ridiculously large amounts constantly. They’re only after the big guys as it’s the most logical way to get big busts. Swatting a dude over let’s say 10 bars is completely ridiculous and that’s why it never really happens. Sigh. I've done this for years. So have my friends. It works. 

I am not a scientist.  I cannot explain how it works.  Actually,  scientists can't explain how a lot of things work -- like benzos, for example.  They don't know HOW they work. They just know THAT they work. 

I don't know HOW this 3 days of methadone thing works.  I just know from years of experience THAT it works.

Detoxes in NYC used to do something similar,  but with a rapd taper. Detoxes and rehabs today do something similar with a rapid taper of subs.

I do the same thing but no taper. You don't get sick 24 hours after your last dose of methadone.  Heck, given methadone's long half-life,  it's still in your system 24  hours after your last dose. That's probably part of the reason this works.

Again, I've done it for years and years as have various friends and roommates.  It works. I have no reason to lie to you. 

You can believe me or not although why you think I or anyone would lie about this I don't know.  If you get the opportunity to try it, definitely do. And when you find out it works, as you will, post about it here.

Edit/Update --  and a downvote. Wtf? Why? Look, I understand this may seem unusual.  It may be new information.  But Ive been polite and I am trying to help people.  So I don't think a downvote is appropriate. I know. But it's still good information to have.  Knowledge is power. If you look up bitcoin atms in your area, there may be one close to you. They charge a little more but all you need is a bitcoin wallet on your phone.  There’s a few sites online you can use to get them. A quick google search will help you pick :)Late reply, but check out paxfulTrue, but most methods require identification, or other such elements You do all your fed timeI just mean, weren't you worried they would bring the mail in and get raided while your weren't there or did you have delivery times set up while you were home? Seems legit, thanks for educating the ignorant lol[deleted]Paxful is a good site to get bitcoin quickly and in ways that are super convenient. Not to hard sell, but that's where I got my first bitcoin with a steam gift card. On the site I use (Paxful), I only need email verificationThank you! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Is this how everyone else got started, Content: , ups: 876, downs: 0For me it was my happiness, stability, and sanity...For me it was my Pokémon cards ��Fidget spinners are a gateway drug.Personally I couldn't find anymore free oxysI definitely started at the bottom of the drug ladder to offset being bored. I can't imagine starting off with HMine was. I got a breathalyzer in my car and couldn’t drink and be able to drive so I started using heroin instead. True story. 28 months clean now thank god It was my ex wife. It was either h or murder. I chose the lesser of two evils. I can't wait to tell my mom that she could have avoided years of disappointment and pain if she had just bought me that damn fidget spinner! relapsed cus of this���For me it was dropping out of college. Usually it's the reverseMine started with a conversation:

Friend: \*nodding off\* "I should introduce you to Harry bro!"  
Me:  "I dunno man, i'm pretty content with Mary atm"

Friend: "Fuck Mary"

&#x200B;

And that's how it started. I need to find a Delorean and go back to that point in my life.Fuck man this is bringing up feelsThis speaks to me This made me lol too hardI started accidently through no fault of my own. There I was walking down the street to go help out at the orphanage and I tripped and fell onto a perfectly positioned loaded rig that stuck perfectly into my vein and my weight falling on it made it inject into my bloodstream. Lol 


Nah really I lost a bet and the loser had to get hooked on heroin. Who was the bet with? Life.


(These are jokes for those of you that cant tell)

I love playing with that shit while I nod Lol is there anyone else when they come across the name Devon automatically think "DEVON GET THE TABLE!" ???Why not? LMAOOOOOO no but thats how i relapse ���For me it was weed, xans, booze, shrooms, in hs then adderall and xans and blues and 80’s, then snorting h, been shooting h 4 years, but now on methadone clinic at 170 mg’s with a script of Wellbutrin and xans- 3 footballs a day, I be feeling right everydayIt was either dope and slowly kill myself or immediate hanging.Nicely said. i apparently have a lot of friends addicted to fidget spinners...they always talk about get spun out all the time...it sounds like its a brutal addiction, it ruins your teeth and they cause vicious paranoia .....I dont think Im ever gonna try a fidget spinnner...how can something so small be ruining out country..this getting spun stuff is crazy.

apparently all those dudes out at 3am are all hooked on fidget spinning..Lol!
Yeah... the ones I was buying were suddenly gone, and the new ones would turn into a gel like substance. Quite inconvenient. 
So, Heroin here I come! What’s that, kind sir? $15? I’ll take two! same except first thing I tried was a few vicodin that were left by my great grandmother when she was living with us. popped 3 and fell in love with the sedation/opiate itch. other than that it was the standard stoner/hippie progression through high school... schwag-mids-shrooms-chronic-lsd and/or mdma.

strangely enough it would be another 4 years before I would try another opiate when splitting an old school 60mg oc with a homie. that's what ended up getting me hooked.i think it’s a common misperception that (most) people start out doing heroin. as if someone just out of the blue offered them heroin and they were like, “yea, that sounds wonderful!” i think that’s why addiction is so stigmatized, because people think it’s that simple, so they‘re like, “well just don’t shoot heroin in the first place.” wow, thanks, franklin, i really didn’t consider that. [deleted]Happy b day my dude metro ❤️�bitches be tripping yo....

lolDamn bro Nods in agreement So you dropped out for heroin or because of heroin?Exit the community. You're kidding right?How the hell do people get continually upped to 170?? I was shooting 3g of dope a day but after 3 weeks of 50 mgs methadone im clearly super stable on it and as much as id like to go way up i dont have any real withdrawal symptoms remaining and i feel like itd be hard to fake still being so uncomfortable for so many more weeks until im at a dose like that lol. I second that. Dope doesn't kill you, people do.psst. pssst. yo playa, yeah you. you tryin to get spun? *opens trench coat revealing dozens of fidget spinners*It’s getting “spun outta control” huh? 

Teehee. I was reading your comment all the while thinking "nice, bro" then realized I was giddy about someone's addiction story. Tf is wrong with me. 

Mine started with Vicodin too. 10years Vic's, 4 years Suboxone, 2 years herion.hey them old vicodins were the shitSame exact thing! Grandma would give me her liquid morphine and vics and percs.Then came the ocs (a month of heroin) and finally the animal that is methadone.Yeah I was very persistent on never doing dope, didn’t even get into pills. I could of counted all the percs or painkillers in general on two hands before I got into heroin. Just doing cocaine, and that progressed to crack when I walked in the bathroom and my buddy was blasting off, and he was a junkie so it was like never be like this guy. Just stayed with the hard for a year and eventually had a bunch of heroin I was sitting on and was coming down and was wondering how well it would ease the landing and really the rest is history, fucking loved it. 

Just Kratom psychs and bud now. Lol franklin was one of my rehab councilors so that put that whole comment with a picture of him at the other end and gave me a good laugh Well some people do... i mean im sure very very few as their first drug but probably lots as their first opiate. It was my first downer for sure[deleted]Lol.. Thx for the laugh. I couldn't figure out how to do it. hahahaEnter the dragonCome onThat's ridiculousI ain't trying to get spun, motherfucker! I use them *medicinally*! Now, uh...lemme hold one till Thursday...
I’m laughing so hard right now. 
(Reaching out the window and throws an empty pack of cigarettes down to the person on the street with three spinners inside)I only smoke crack, I'll never be like you, smelly junkie.i feel you. i always thought it was funny how crackheads are portrayed, all playing rug doctor and shit. i thought it was a joke. well, what do you know, first time i smoked crack and i'm looking through my sweater to see if i can gather up enough rocks for another stuffie. rocks will fuck you up, quick. blow through your money, quick. put me on a mission to stroll through the mission to sample every cornerboy's girl, looking for only the "finest" of rocks. really, i just wanted a reason to smoke as much fucking crack as i could. i associated with some very strange folks because of crack.haha, yea, that's where the reference came from, i had a counsellor named franklin at my treatment center too. any chance you went to treatment in northern california? probably extremely unlikely but it would be pretty neat if we're talking about the same guy. yea, for sure, you're right. i didn't mean to suggest that it never happens. i moved to slamming heroin from my first opiate, oxy, pretty quickly. but i think for a lot of people, they start out using to counter something like pain or depression, as opposed to just jumping right in the deep end shooting dope. but yea, like you said, there are people that do.okay, but i’m more so talking about stigma and opinions, separate from knowledge of addiction. within the field of addiction, there is generally a lot of understanding and education, like you said. but, at least in my experience, people’s opinions of addicts can be pretty narrow-minded. some folks seem to see addiction as black and white. i totally agree that general societal understanding of addiction is progressing, but i think destigmatization still has a long way to go.

i live in california. people here are for the most part very open-minded. but even here on reddit, there are a lot of very strong opinions regarding addicts — i guess with the anonymity of the internet, people feel free to express these opinions.Good for you for leaving her. I can’t imagine doing heroin to cope with an unhealthy relationship. I hope you’re in a healthier place man, in both respects.I get it.GTFORofl, happy new years brother/sister!...dips on the plugHey that’s alright. 

Crack brought my life to worst points than heroin did. I did bad and shady things for both at times, together or separate but boy did crack literally bring out my crack head shit. 

And the only thing this junkie smells like is Gucci son. It’s very easy to do. I’ve definitely been there as well. If I knew I was going to be jonesing, yet had enough to make this worth doing, I’d bust a gram up into a good bit of rocks and throw them into a preswept section of carpet, so that way when I needed something to do I could carpet surf for more. Sometimes it worked great and kept me busy all night, one time I loaded up a big old rock of cookie cream and fucked up my lungs and pipe. That shit sucked. 

I’d known people that would surf at their dudes house, people would get kicks out of it. Laughing, throwing more crumbs on the floor. It’s crazy how much pride it’ll take from you for another hit. Some of the ways people would degrade themselves for a 2 minute blast is astonishing. Yeah, I see where you’re coming from. burning bridges over less than $20 since 2009Lol, sorry that was supposed to be you saying that to your friend shooting up in the bathroom from your story.

Thought it was funny how you didn't want to be a junky so only smoked crackOh and what does Gucci smell like? Vinegar? Im curiou qhat types of thing you didPricelessYeah it’s crazy how the worked out. I told myself I’d never do cocaine either, but than when it was around, and I had the money to play, it pretty much changed to I’ll never do heroin. I loved it, and that time smoking crack was fucking amazing. He gave me a blast and a half, that short lived ten minute amazing turned around to just another twenty two more times that night. I learned to go big or not play at all lol. 

He was the perfect reason to never do heroin. To not be a Gary. The place I was staying at was a duplex, 5 of us one one side, and 4 on the other, all friends or mutual friends from high school. Always partying, liquor and cocaine and k2 since I sold it and smoked it and that’s where the cash came from to keep partying. Gary needed a place to crash and it was like why not, a few people pretty much always crash here yet don’t live here, what’s one more. He said he was done with the junk. He’d already lost everything from it and was just building back up. 

And we were always trying to stay with the best coke, always buying bags, going through me or a few others, either hoping for something better or better price, it’s just good to know what’s around and establish connections. And one night Gary had the best of the deals for the girl so we gave the money to him, like three of us, and only two of us got our girl, my buddy came up 60 short because he had to swallow the bag when he got pulled over but kept the others? And Gary later that night after our suspicions were high, came out of the bathroom nodding with pinned eyes, said he got lucky and found 4 15s at his dudes. 

4x15=60. Also only swallowed one bag of blow, kept two, and found 4 15s. We collectively through him out so fast, 2 am pouring rain throwing his shit outside telling him to kick rocks. 

But boy did that fucker change my life. Cracks fucking amazing. Crack and heroin are as good as it gets. 

And boy it smells fucking amazing. Gotta get a bottle when you can. I got one for Christmas last year and have smelt good as fuck for over a year lol. What do you mean? I have stories or warning for days lol. I tried crack once at the trap and I'm assuming I just didn't smoke it right or was timid cause it was pretty lack luster. Probably for the best that it didn't rock my world. 

Fucking Gary. It's crazy how people think that kinda shit will work out for them, that or they just don't give a fuck...I'm fucking loving your words man, care to hit me with another story?Yea he just really didn’t. He hadn’t been doing them often, like not really at all. He’d been doing coke with us pretty often, he’d throw down when he could but we weren’t stingy, you’d walk in the door and there’d be a pile of black plates and powder going around and if the party ever got to big we just went up stairs to the bedroom. Like he fucked up what would be a great thing to be in his position all over a high. But shit will do that. 

And yeah that’s probably good. It helped he showed me how to hit it, and he was already geeked when I walked in so he wasn’t wanting to see any wasted. And it blasted me off, to the point I was pretty disappointed when I couldn’t talk him into walking the neighborhood. I’m trying to think of a good oneHaha, I might have to give it another shot.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Literally the worst, Content: , ups: 850, downs: 0"have you tried not sleeping?Lmaoo this is literally the experience I had with my last psych and therapist, trying to convince me snorting Xanax will get me higher, or even worse, Zoloft feels similar to opiates.How about you don't do drugs till our next session and telll me how it goes?I had a therapist trying to recommend an alprolozam script for me, knowing full well I was an active junkie. It was kinda nuts. I almost took him up on it. Yes im sorry i dont care how many books youve read idc how many docuseries youve watched i dont care how many family members youve seen addicted you can not counsel some body about being physically mentally and emotionally addicted to fentanyl if you have not woken up soaked in your own pool of sweat with 6 months of unpaid bills on your counter 12 dollars in your bank acct that the only way you have access to is if you close the acct so you count the 2 dollars in change you have take yourself to your credit union close the acct while sweat drips down your face and the woman helping you asks you why your closing your acct with them to which you reply ive got to eat maam she then slides you a paper to sign and your shaking so bad you can barely scribble you collect your 12.30 cents now your at 14.30 and you troop 30 blocks in the rain thats now falling for 3 bags that amount to maybe .1 of a gram but fuck if this all wasnt worth it then you stand in said rain soaked for 25 minutes before the guy tells you shit my guys eating walk two more blocks over to me ill serve you you then reply with bro im soaked its 24 degrees and ive been standing in the rain for half hour just waiting can you throw 1 on top for all the nonsense there reply bro you havent called me forever to which you reply I AINT BEEN GTTN HIGH YOU KNOW YOUR MY ONLY GUY  while this is true they cave and say ok ok you get your 4 bags amounting to .1 and a few grissles and all is well you inquire if they stock suboxone because thats what you really want as youve been taking them the last month cause your sick of the bullshit but you cant find any today and you just need something but to no avail they say nahh with a look of are you crazy i want you addicted fool so you take your sad 4 bags and walk your 30 blocks back home cause hey everythings okay now even though you know its not that was 4 days ago in the days since you buy 5 bags each day trying to stay well hoping each day your sub plug will say hes got subs again but no luck and you know when he does get them they wont be working the way they were prior to your 4 day slip up because now your bodys use to the junk again so you pray at night wondering how the fuck your gonna scrounge up ten dollars in the hopes you can get a sub tomorrow knowing the sub wont do much but hoping it does something and if no subs are available jesus how will you get 25 dollars for the .133 that your 5 bags contain all the while a stunning drug free college educated beautiful 29 year old woman lays in bed waiting for you to cuddle up next to her because she cant sleep well with out you she knows your addicted but she loves you anyway and she would give you the money to keep you well but youve already taken all she has to give shes working 3 jobs to keep you housed and fed and you cant ask for anything more from her she would help if she could but shes already helped so much that all her funds are exhausted and shes scraping by carrying you the entire way also she sees your pain but shes helpless at the moment you sit outside smoking cigarettes in despair not quite sick 4 bags ingested with 1 left will you be able to save it till the morning so you can maybe get a jump start on a day labor gig for the day probably not so you sit and type smoking reds thinking about just ending it all but you cant you have people that love you just a handful but they are there what to do whst to do i dont know where this was suppose to go but long story short how do you counsel this lord help me Have you tried not craving them? I always dose at 9am. Unless I sleep past 9am. All these comments have me cracking the fuck up. Counselors that haven’t been through it. But oh wait they had a family member go through it so they know exactly how our minds work! Yea right gtfo noob��� Ok, now this right here is just ridiculously accurate. Especially the kind of counselors you see at a MAT/MMT clinic. This can even apply to the people actually working on the medical side of things. I can't tell you how many times I've overheard the dosing nurses and even the friggin nurse practitioner say something so utterly ridiculous that I'm left a bit speechless. This is hilarious and so true. I have a hard time even taking what they say seriously if they aren't a (long time) recovering addict themselves. Lmao. I have a new counselor at the clinic and to be fair I am holding big things close to the best but after our first two sessions I’m like hmmmmm .. she might be... umm clueless I don't think they need to be full blown recovering addicts to understand how to help, but if they have never tried drugs at all, I have a hard time seeing them being able to understand.I’ve had this experience before but my current therapist was heavily addicted to alcohol and opiates so she is very understanding and helpful in my recovery.Best response worst life incase your wondering i didnt save the last bag and i crawled into bed and cried my eyes out to my saint of a lady whos response was i love you itll be okay well get you back on subs i loveee this woman and if you saw her you would say wtfffff is she doing but thank god for her seriously thnk god for her I had a psychiatrist at the psych ward ask me "Do you like boys or girls?" "Both to an extent."

Psych: Are you a cat person or a dog person?

Me: I was raised with both and love both.

P: Oh, I see. Well, where I was going with that was that you have to start saying no to drugs. Just how most people don't have to think about refusing their non preferred, you just have to automatically refuse when presented with drugs.

M: Oh wow, doc, I can't believe I never thought of just wishing my problem away! It's all so clear!

Doc had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. Like for real, are you Nancy Reagan? I’m a strong believer they should not be counselors or addiction experts until they themselves have intentionally gotten themselves addicted to a drug and had to experience withdrawals and everything that comes along with life everyday while dealing with that. 

This is definitely one of the best memes I’ve ever seenWelcome to Canada...Hey, maybe you can help me out as I am a little confused. I notice this pic seems to be a local jpg but I was told you had to link from imgur to post pics. Can you clarify?When you lack the ability to use an open mind. When your unwilling to take suggestions or theres a selfish drive to always be right. 
Clearly poor choice of words, no wonder they get  poor responses to  questions or statements.“I used to get headaches when I wouldn’t have my Starbucks so yes, I know exactly what it’s like going through fentanyl withdrawals”People who say anything about snorting Xanax makes me want to shoot them up with...well I was gonna say ibogaine but I'm leaning more towards and actual gun. Thats hyperbolic but the rage I feel when people say dumb shit like that is all consuming. Artie lange had a good bit about this when he was on Conan a few years ago.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5z6bZAT2EM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5z6bZAT2EM)Why were they trying to suggest that? I don't use opioids, but why not suggest one of those drugs that exists to help ween you off?12 hours later....its not going great, think ill go do drugs. You’re a stronger person than me yeah  would have shaggy'd that quick. (yoink)I had a rehab write me a script for ambien that my pcp continued until I woke up in jail. Twice This.....just best response right here.The experience of needing dope and risking getting ripped off and played with and all that.... yeah it's incredibly stressful. 

Make suboxone cheap and OTC I say, if not full legalization that would still do a world of good. People don't rob and steal cause they want to get high, they do it cause they don't want to be sick. Oh fuck. I wish i had thought about that! Im cured  doc!do you ever think that... yeah - counselors that havent been through it.... look at us like we are fucking retarded and equally naive when they listen to us talk about the shit we do for a drug addiction? as an addict, this post makes me sick with how fucking dumb a lot of us sound... because this person trying to help you hasnt made a bunch of really stupid mistakes, and has a steady job, and doesnt stab themselves with needles, they are the real idiots and have nothing to say that could possibly help me. non-junky idiots i tell ya. how foolish they are. lol. bring on the down votes, you guys can keep victimizing yourselves. That's like saying an Oncologist can't effectively treat cancer if they haven't beaten leukemia. It's one thing to be ignorant like the counselor in the picture but I've dealt with lots of of counselors who weren't former addicts who were still extremely knowledgeable and empathetic to my problems.What does this even mean?You don't need imgur anymore. When you create a post it gives you the option to upload a picture from your device, on most subsI'm not reading anything about that in the sidebar. Who told you that? good one, clever boy.I had one tell me he knew what it was like because he bought too many scratch off lottery tickets... I’m like yeah dude that’s identical to shooting up with puddle water and then hiding the abscess you get until it burst in your long sleeve shirt that you have on even though it’s 105 degrees Ugh I gave my friend a whole bar the other day bc she was dopesick and when I got back from class, she had SNORTED the whole thing. And not only had she snorted it, she snorted it with adderall. WTF? I wanted to shake the stupid out of her, I was so pissed she wasted the bar.I did it once, what's wrong with it?I honestly like snorting Xanax lol... the taste and drip and fixation of putting things up my nose is real... even though poping them is the right way to get ur money’s worth For depression/anxiety, I wasn't dependent and was a minor so that's probably whyFor me it was more like as soon as I walked out the door and get into buddy's car lollol same, when I was 15 years old. To be fair, it had just hit the market and they didn't know all the horrible side effects of it yetya know you just have to fake it till you make it. I know your'e 40 hours no sleep deep into wd's, but lets try a smile.Maybe they should try another counseling profession instead of addiction then???????????? I understand where you are coming from, but addiction is a whole different ballgame. IMO They just can’t effectively understand why you are feeling how you are feeling and why you are doing the things you do regardless of how negatively they impact your life unless they have been there. But like I said, just my take. thank you for this comment. the comments on this page are comically self-centered. sheer bigotry.Just a jab at how much of a joke service providers seem to be 

You go in looking to get off pills and they’re just going by the book Does that include regular pc?A mod said you have to link to imgur"Have you tried just saying no? I find that when I want a regular coca-cola, I just say, '"you know, I don't need that." And I go for a brisk walk "Then just fucking snort heroin wtf You’re what is commonly referred to as a “weirdo”Ah, I see, thanks.No because then this page wouldnt exist.For real though what's toxic is this feeling of superiority people get from having "never been addicted." No oncologist feels superior to his patients because he "wasn't dumb enough to get cancer" but I'm sure there are more than a few addiction specialists who feel this way about addiction. Some people can, it's very rare thoYes sir, when you post, it will give you options they'll be "link", "text", "photo" ect.... if you pick photo, i'tll let you upload images directly. I think they meant “if you’re going to link to a photo hosted outside of Reddit, it needs to be hosted on imgur”. 

They don’t want people linking to random tumblr blogs or google itself. Either hit upload on Reddit (which uploads and links to imgur) or link to a photo already hosted on imgur. 

Hope this helps. I'd talk to that mod for clarification then, if I were you. This.  Omg this.  

I had a therapist leading one of my groups use the example of ‘wanting another cookie and saying no’ to tell us that she understands what we’re going through.  The class was full of heroin and crack addicts.  Seriously lady?  I’ll ‘just say no’ to anything you have to say after that. Lmao my Dad could cure everyone with a brisk walk. Exercise... yepHaha the ol brisk walk. Don’t forget mindfulness, yoga & Pilates! This is so accurate that I got angry when I read it. Ugh I do that too bitchYou seem to have a real problem with how people take their drugs. Why does it bother you so much?Thanks for helping!! :) :)Thanks. Reddit help is not all that comprehensive, it seems to me. I tried to upload a local jpeg for the first time, but somehow it did not load right. Then I posted, but no picture. So then they are telling me about imgur, so I guess that is the way to go. My group therapist tried to compare hit over eating with drug addiction. I spoke up and said one of the requirements to be a drug counselor should be a history w drug addiction. Over eating!! Are u serious!!!!?I had a counsler try to relate his depression of losing his mother (he was early 40's) with the depression i was going through due to massive OC wd's and losing a few friends to a bust.Will f*** just eats one cookie?You ever tried snuff?It's that, it's the fact benzos don't get you high from snorting it, you just get high from it dripping down your throat and swallowing it from snorting it. Take your drugs any which way you want, as long as you get high from doing it. It's like saying "why do you get mad from people smoking their mdma?" Idk i might get downvoted into oblivion, but that's my train of thought. I'm not going to bitch someone out for taking their drugs a certain way but it's going to make me really frustrated when someone thinks doing something gets you way higher when in reality it dosnt get them high at all really.Why are you acting like people actually care what gets said in an internet thread? You're quite welcome, it isn't often I can be useful when it comes to technology lolYeah this one is OK man losing your mother can be devastating depending on the person losing a mother is a lot more depressing than your self-induced drug problem. do you know how moronic you sound? i guess MASSIVE oc wd's are worse than someone losing a life. lol. everyone in here bitching about therapists... shouldnt have gotten yourself in the situation where you have to see one. we must take responsibility for our habit.Ever boof snuff?
But smoking mdma is the most efficient way of consuming it!i lost both my parents in my 20's, im fine. i was fine. people die.dont know why your downvoted. thats truthThat sounds painful True enough, my favorite way is to sprinkle it onto an open wound..I'm sorry man but the way you feel is not universalYou are suppose to take it out of the can Bro I take my vitamin c tablets the exact same way!I'm not a psychopath, i was sad, i cried.  But it wasnt mind bending depression like kicking an IV habit. Ayy lmao @@@@@@@@@@ Title: One of my friends sent this to me on FB earlier LOL, Content: , ups: 850, downs: 0Added this to this list of jokes I can't tell my friends cause they won't get it I think it would hBs been funnier if f was like “let’s see what’s underneath the roxy”

AmiRight ? take off the fentanyl mask to reveal: **carfentanyl!**  

Under that one is...*the Reaper.*I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling testing labs!this is mean but r/lilpeepKinda funny not really tho fent bars are rare af and usually just a cross contamination from pressing multiple things it would have been better if it was a blue or sum heroin Lmao that’s some funny shytBorrowing this kk LMAOyeah everyone’s gotta learn their lesson, first time I every tried benzos I was 18 or 19 did a bunch of Kpins cause they were 2 bucks a pop and I was used to paying 10 a pop for e pills so I was like give me 40 bucks worth. 

        Ate em all over the night with a friend because we didn’t think felt it. started drinking later and a older kid we knew saw us popping pills and asked what they were, once he found out he said Stop drinking immediately but we didn’t listen. 

        later on another friend asked me to drive his car cause he was drunk, I said sure went to pull out into the street and had turned the steeering wheel all the way to the wrong side and immediate hit a telephone poll. Not too much damage but my driving privileges were taken away from me. the dude ended up driving with me in his car and his license was suspended and ofc we get pulled over, tried to run, almost faked em out by pulling in a driveway with a fence before they made the turn. 
 
        Didn’t work tho. Ended up impounding the car but not arresting him because  hey saw how fucked up I was and said we made the right decision by having him drive! Crazy. After that o quit drinking with benZos for a long time It's a damn shame I haven't found any that don't need to be shipped in the mail. I'd switch my name to Bartard Maximus and die happy if I didn't forget I took em.

The people who don't want em, get em. I'm over here like, "I accept any and all forms of hard narcotics" and all I hear is "Ayy I got half a sub". Gtfoh.I’m dead XDYour friends never watched Scooby Doo? I think you know what you need to do. Hahaha! Yeah it would have. Xanax is just such a fad right now though, it's kind of annoyingKnew a guy who almost died from fent bars recently. He was damn lucky our friend who is on subs was there to shove a couple under his tounge.Shut up and take my money.Agreed, idk why people keep pushing this false narrative. Thanks for saying this. I really don't believe there have ever been bars intentionally pressed with fent. Cross\-contamination, sure. But the economics just don't make sense, let alone effects are so different.Time to get pressed bars Its in a weird place where it has nowhere near the stigma of opiates, but IMO its just as addictive, especially if ur an anxious person. I would put Xanax on the same shelf as Oxycodone. Its a hard drug! But nobody treats it like that, fricken saul from Breaking Bad had a wole drawer of them! Being a bartard is just as shitty as being a junkie in some ways, if not worse in others, and harder to get out, because that shit can kill youAll these kids taking Xanax fail to realize that Pfizer has been marketing it since 1981.ive been prescribed for half of my life on and off. This drug is almost 30. Years. Old. 
I also hate how presses are treated like they're actually worth half a shit. There's young people out here who are addicted to xanax bars....and have never put a single milligram of alprazolam into their bodies.......
How much sense does that make? 
Its so senseless.I'm not quite sure that's how that works. The naloxone in subs is to prevent their abuse. Wouldn't do much for a real fent OD, and the added bupe would exacerbate any respiratory depression from the benzo/fent combo.[deleted]Awww look three sheeple were actually smart enough to kno I was calling them sheeple and down voted me what ever will I do without 3 reddit karma I’ve been ruined damn u sheeple damn u all to hell lmao �I do it’s called sheeple lmao � can’t research or cross reference anything on there own and look at it logically and Discern for themselvesYea no problem your welcome and your right the economics is exactly the proof that it’s not intentional and the bigger picture to the efftects is that dealin drugs is a business and ppl in buisness do not want to give u the wrong product and the customers b unsatisfied let alone end up dead so the can never give there money to you again for drugs in the future which once again is economics exactly why they don’t intentionally press fent bars and like I said anyone that believes that they do is truly among the sheeple masses  I was gonna say heroin, but that works too.I never liked the shit. I have a short enough attention span as it is. Life is already short enough as it is. I don't need to forget anymore of it than I already do. 

Plus, I've lost a lot of really close friend to this shit because they got strung out on it and it completely changed. They would get violent and try to hit me for no reason. I had a friend walk up to me one night after he'd been on a binge with it for like 4 days straight and he tried to hit me in the head with a glass cup in his fist. I was just sitting at my computer desk. Nothing had been said, nothing had happened at all. Just got up all of a sudden and walked up to me to try and hit me. 

Then the friends who went around driving and flipped their cars, totaled their shit. 

Imo, it destroys peoples personalities more than Heroin does.  Xanax just E R A S E S everything it means to be YOU. Being a bartard sucks ass but I’ve never found benzos to be remotely as addictive as opiates because of the lack of euphoria. There is no fiendish pull to do them like I used to experience with opiates, I can use a benzo therapeutically once or twice a week, where as opiates became everyday very very quickly. There just isn’t much of a high or euphoria with a benzo like Xanax, not like opiates at least. The addiction to bars is worse. The withdrawals last weeks, and unlike dope withdrawals they you won't just feel like you're dying. Benzo withdrawals can actually kill you. And a lot of the home pressed bars are fentanyl. Last year I was popping bars to get through withdrawals like I always do and I realized *there was no withdrawals.* After 2 weeks when I ran out of bars I got hit with nasty fuckin withdrawals out of the blue cuz the home press bars i had werent benzos but opiates, and one would have to assume fentanyl. [deleted]Bupe can counteract opioid overdoses in a similar way to nalaxone. Or at least I have been led to believe that.Bupe has one of the highest binding affinities around, it's why you can't get high while it's still in your body without taking a supremely stupid dose of another strong opiate.Totally opiate naive, super high benzo tolerance. Fent has low oral bioavailability.Lmao.  I upvoted you.Much more than boofing Kratom.You've completely spoke in rhyme , do you do that all the time ?IMO benzos are wayyyyyyyyyy worse than opiates.  it's not even close.

it's like hard liquor in pill form with extra memory loss/blackout potential.

and it's better at "relieving anxiety" ie removing ALL your inhibitions, especially your GOOD inhibitions.

it removes all your higher brain function and you just run on animal instinctI didn't think of the bupe 'taking over' the receptors. But that makes sense with precipitated withdrawal. Still seems like 'a few strips' added to whatever was happening wasn't the best idea. In my experience sublingual bupe takes 45-60mins to really start acting. Isn't that enough time for the fent to get you first?




And you still have to deal with the combined respiratory depression.[deleted][deleted]Thank you I don’t know what I woulda done with all those down votes might have loaded a phat rig with pure fent bars and ended it all � and btw u didn’t have to u weren’t one of those Grimy two timing sheeple that like other sheeple to violate them atop a float in the middle of an LGBT parade lol srry if that went too far n offended u or anyone that swing the other way I just find that a lot of sheeple don’t know how to “identify” and like to b social justice warriors  Omg I fucking love benzos...Yeah, I got access to a stash of Valiums when I was a teenager (long, long ago, before internet) and even then I'd rather have had alcohol.  Different chemistry I guess.  I had a buddy basically get addicted to DXM (changed his personality, too, over months), I tried it once on his suggestion...never again.  Other than alcohol, Mother Morphine and her descendants seem to be the only things I'm attracted to.I am an alcoholic who will often smash benzos to cure the anxiety of being so drunk, after a 5th and 50mg of Valium since you're an anxious person you spend the next 3 hours monitoring you're heart rate promising you won't do it again.

I am...Hey, it worked. He is is alive and taking his final exams, ready to graduate UMD. I'll take it.[deleted][deleted]if you treat it with respect like you would heroin you can have a normal habit with... unfortunately most people have to learn their lesson by going overboard first.... as did I lolI'm just saying wondering if it worked, or if he wasn't as far gone as you all thought. I mean, I'm not going to shit on any situation where people are doing the best they can with what they have, but I'm still skeptical that seeing someone who has ingested some amount of (supposed) benzo, then deciding it was probably fent and treating it with a few(!) sub strips (that is a shit-ton of bupe of he was opiate naive) is a best harm reduction practice.




Glad he is ok, though.Well if it was IV'd, my understanding is that then the naloxone would work.I really doubt that bars are being pressed en masse with fent, it's just not economically viable or sensible. I imagine this is much more likely a case of cross contamination from poor handling.I used to hate em back when I did opiates, but now theyre actually super useful for helping with anxiety and shit.

never went full bartard... just like 3/4 bartard and that was good enough for me.I have know other people who have used this method. Unfortunately if my friend had called the paramedics it would likely have resulted in them being expelled from uni. And he knew it was fent because friend who was on subs took some and recognized the feeling, and the symptoms. And belive me I know how dangerous benzos and subs can be, lost my best friend to that combo.[deleted]Honestly it COULD be happening, but I see very little if any evidence; I've yet to see any confirmed reports of this, though admit that I do not follow much US news. Any decent sized DNM vendor would not bother doing this, it's not profitable and all vendors know how much fentanyl sellers are being targeted. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Accurate, Content: , ups: 818, downs: 0Every time I yawn lately my parents are like you've gotta stop those pills. 
And I'm like yeah my day was good, long but good, you? I used to hate putting on a fucking act. If i say I'm fine I'm fine.Yup.. soon as my eyes close ... “YOUR NODDING!” Finger pointers up.. I just lost me two best and only friends because they decided Im using again and that's the last straw, because I was tired one night hanging out. I've been clean a year. To be completely fair we WERE also on drugs. Agree. A few weeks ago, i went from Charlotte to Mexico City, down to Acapulco, jumped over to deal with an issue at Panama Canal, then to Bogata Columbia, then to Rio de Janiero, Brazil and back to Mexico for a day then home to Miami �� 

All in 12 days. I passed out at dinner and the wife is like, are u on fuking dope ....��Dude this is so accurate. I can’t believe as soon as I got home this meme popped up.....Guys I'm already high....dunno how I'll manage the turkey and scrubbing the potatoes...maybe some Moda or Ms. Rita-lin to wake me up? Enjoying the days off! 

Happy Thanksgiving you all. 

&#x200B;Been getting dirty looks all day. I’m sure I’ll hear about it once everyone leaves.Lmao always!!Whats dank recovery?  I would yelled at about being high while on vivitrolLMFAOOmg I was opposite. I was the only one who passed out after and they thought something was wrong. Like, yes I'm still high but I swear it was the Turkey!!YusssMy family always thinks I'm high when I'm actually sober I'm like wtf!I used to have ptosis (droopy eyelids) and I always had that permanent high/stoned look. Finally got surgery to correct it and I didn’t realize how much I was missing out on seeing by not having regular open eyes that's interesting cause the only time I ever yawn is when i'm in withdrawal or otherwise not high. my family is pretty cool with my opioid habit though so they're not gonna say anything even if they thought I was yawning cause I was high.I'm so sorry that happened. Congratulations on the year ... I've got 15 months.Don't let it throw you off, it's them not you,and this phase of theirs will pass when they see that you don't descend back down the rabbitholeAnd continue to be... This is what happens when u watch narcos once smh And sober when im actually high. Aint that some shit?Retarded blame culture forces us to lie about our habit, when in reality we'd rather be honest �Back in the day I was snorting so much heroin and ice one day and my mom looked at me and said this is how I like you when you’re sober and interactive with everyone.  Then when I was sick she would be mad at me that I was on drugs.  Kinda fucks with your head.My family too, close friends, spouse.

&#x200B;

The on top of the world workaholic they think is sober(hahahahaha) and the sullen withdrawn lazy sleeping all day they think is on drugs(lol).Haha yeah it was always opposite because they got so used to seeing me high.Right?! They’re like “we know you’re high because that’s when you get angry at us.” I’m like damn y’all when I’m high is when I’m most relaxed and not tryna fight. When I’m sober and y’all are tripping on me is when I get pissed lolI have a question, were you able to open your eyes completely when you tried? Because I know someone who almost constantly has partially shut eyes but if someone bugs him about it he can force them all the way open. In any case, I’m glad you got them fixed and can see better now! Not all junkies fly signs or give up ass for $$. This will be my 18th year covering the SA/CA zone.
My product is pure and uncut ..Nice username lol. 
Also i feel like it’s because they’re used to you being high so when you aren’t you seem different Good point. I’d love to be honest with people. Everyone would benefit from the honesty and quite frankly it would lead to lower mortality rates and overall less drug use. [deleted]lol, yup. my ma always thought i was high when i was withdrawing. she thought being high made me into a sickly, irritated, pissy shit. then when i was high, she thought i was sober because i was “back to normal.” 

now that i’m sober i get so self-conscious about how i act because i don’t want people to think that i’m high. it’s weird.Yeah I could open them all the way but I actively had to do it, it felt unnatural and didn’t look right. Otherwise I looked like I was either really tired or stoned. wait what do you actually do? If youre not comfortable saying that's cool but is this a legit, above-board type of job? Ya and when you're not high you feel like shit and look fucked up... Parents just don't understand ������ like no when I'm completely functional and playing Yehtzee with y'all I'm high... I guess because other drugs do fuck you up and impair you, make you look funny and that's all they have to compare it to?Lol thanks. And thats a fair point.Dude that’s such a good point it’s like they get used to you when your wasted but when you stone cold sober they always like what’s wrong with you , are you using again ? Like fuuuuck I’m sober Ma take it easy Bitch THIS yes. This thread has me TRIGGERED ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������


The turkey snuck in when I was furiously tapping. Happy thanksgiving y’all So you talk about opiates freely with your family and they don't blame them for X or for Y? CuntVery legit. I deal in the most valuable product on the planet, more than diamonds, gold and the biggest, fatest Afgan bricks of dope combined.

How'd you figure out that's what you wanted to do? I'm completely fucking lost at this point in my life. Manual labor, no matter ""well"" it pays, is going to destroy me. It already has.

Damn, I wish I'd had any sort of discipline and realism about the world when I was in school. Making me wanna go back.RetardCan't even  make a constructive argument lol... @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Every single time, Content: , ups: 817, downs: 0When I’ve mixed all the cns depressants and I forget to breath.Did that really truly happen to you guys? You really went from auto to manual? That's scary scary. If you take a ton of promethazine it's shit too I never got how people could take codiene promethazine syrup but then again maybe the tablets are worse. Good for the itching and shit, though. I used to breathe in deeply and audibly when my ex wasn't breathing as often as I'd like. And then she would inhale after she heard me. It was like I was reminding her, hey this is what breathing sounds like you should try it. 

I tried to just let her enjoy it without constantly asking her if she's okay, but also wanted to make sure she was safe, obviously. i swear i be taking the deepest breaths tryna make sure i stay alive �This happens to me more when I'm sober than when I'm highHell yeah Or I'd die lol (joking but as a hater of hashish but weirdly every other hallucinogenic I love) that's what I feel panicking from a a high I Hate unless it's at the end of a trip or similar only Times hashish or cannabis doesn't makes me feel like crap. 
I use my cpap machine in case I forget Breathing for us is not a choice nor an act we control unless supertrained for a long time (as in deep divers) but still you WILL breath or take a breath even under water in most cases even trained before you die.

This is not really something you manually ever do or you can but not something that is needed for survival as all cells are programmed to always survive that's the ultimate goal for all living things and its not by choice Aaaand now I’m manually breathing, thanks a lot guy Happened to me one night and I woke up just as my homie was about to hit me with the narcan. Said my breaths were so shallow. Mixed emotions I felt soooo fucked up and guilty about being pissed he was going to narcan me.I thought i died once.

I didn’t tell anyone.

And had heard that it takes about two minutes for yr brain to shut down from lack of oxygen.

I just laid there and waited

I’m still waiting,But in reality its a reflex but opiates etc dampens this but I don't think you actually manually are doing it or you will not live but just get that feeling. To consciously stop breathing is not easy and even opiates on their own isn't actually that easy to cause it either..

Its your brain � gray matter doing it and making you aware of the fact your breathing and you'll start thinking if I stop focus on breathing ill dieIn hospital nurses kept coming over and telling me to breath because like, I just forgotYeah it be scary too :( Shit happens to me sometimes even when I’m sober Yeah. Had only smoked h before last night night, then I snorted about how much I usually smoke. Shit had me laying down drifting between consciousness, having to make sure I was remembering to breath whenever I could. Good times...Once I was at a party, I had taken nearly half a gram of dihydrocodeine over the course of the day with little tolerance, had drunk an obscene amount, and smoked cigarettes whenever they were available. Even if I was really really trying hard I couldn't get more than a few slow shallow breaths out. Ended up having to buy a tactical line of coke to stimulate my lungs back into functioning. Scary shit though.Oh yeah definitely a few timesTalking strictly weight lmaoo*half gasps / chokes after accidentally not breathing for a minute and a half*

benzos are funDo you mean mixing opiates with alcohol?It happens a shit tonIf I snort a lot of ECP, I’ll be laying in bed for a few minutes and only breathe once or twice. My girlfriend has to remind me to keep breathing.Yeah sometimes. A lot in the past, great times.I feel like this meme was made in reference to weed. Cannabis alters your perception, and you often *notice* breathing, thus going into "manual breathing mode." This can cause anxiety, reinforcing the breathing thing and causing a "panic attack" in a worst case scenario.

Your not in danger, just tweaking out. 

Some of the post-JWH series cannabinoids were beta receptor agonists and did this a lot more than THC does, and I've ridden out my fair share of "manual breathing mode" experiences as a result. (Some of the later compounds were actually dangerous and cardiotoxic, which I found out later. But like AM2201 was pretty safe, just tweaky.)

I've never done enough CNS depressants to have respiratory depression, but it sounds terrifying, as well as actually dangerous. 

Cannabinoids make you *think* you are at risk of forgetting to breath, but it's purely psychological. Opiates can actually make you *really* forget to breathe.Back in like 2011 I used to just lay down relaxing, half falling asleep, then suck in air in a panic because I haven't taken a breathe in well over a minute. Then I have to focus on taking breathes. Repeat.Counting and breathing.  I've done this a bunch.I use to study neuroscience in high school. Promethazine is a antihistamine but its also an Anti-cholinergic. That means if you take 10-20 times the recommended dose, it will have delierant effects. Delierants are a class of hallucinogens that will make you see things that are not there, think you are talking when you are not, and have vivid, realistic hallucinations. I personally would NEVER drink copious amounts of codeine/promethazine. I have such a tolerance to opioids that in an attempt to get a codeine buzz I would probably be having a nightmare trip off the promethazine. Man just take some vicodin. LolMe neither, although the only times I've taken promethazine I was mixing it with IV heroin, fentanyl or morphine so maybe it's not as dramatic with codeine. But goddamn, it really does depress your breathing like a motherfucker - made me feel like I was closer to OD'ing than benzo and opioids ever do. Not a whole lot more euphoric or fun than just opioids by themselves. 

&#x200B;

But I guess it's probably very different for people who don't have huge opioid tolerances, don't inject their shit and can still get really high off of codeine. Honestly I regret having developing such a tolerance - codeine is really damned fun when you have no tolerance and I can only imagine the promethazine mix produces some nice results. Lean looks like such a great time, but I'm convinced that I'd have to take way more than I'm comfortable taking to get any kind of results. But I remember back in the day me and my ex would buy a shit ton of Tylenol 1s (the one with codeine in them, not sure if they're still available OTC or what but we used to just load up our cart with that shit) and bring them home and separate the codeine from all the filler and acetaminophen (distill?). We'd end up with this foul tasting liquid we used to mix with various fruit drinks -- consume them ourselves and sell them at a large mark up to our friends. Good times. If only we'd had some promethazine to throw in there and we could have made a killing chopping lean. Weak opiate potentiated by the prometh = okay buzz if you don’t shoot dope or pop percs all day. I’ve done percs and ion fw them but I’ll Po a 4 whenever That’s kind of how some CPAP machines (Auto Servo ventilators) work. If the machine senses you haven’t taken a breath in a while, it will give you a quick push of air through the mask. This ‘reminds’ your brain to breathe. Weird flex but okYeh, you'll just be sitting there and suddenly you'll start gasping and you realise that you weren't breathing for like a minute Me too tbh I was just wondering about this as I recently got hooked up with a CPAP machine. Does a CPAP machine reduce/eliminate the respiratory depression effects of opiates?Or you have taken so much YOUR ODing and will need autobreathing but from a machineDont ever use a stimulant like that again, thats how mac miller died. His autopsy revealed he had coke and fentanyl in his body. But the amount of fentanyl in him was not fatal not the amount of coke was, but because they were mixed together they were a fatal dose. I always thought uppers would cancel out downers but it seems thats not the case �Damn I never thought about it but I do take a lot of deep breaths when I’m on a bunch of em too lolz i catch myself sighing a lot more than usual I did not know that I don't feel so bad now lolWhat's ecp?So it's only their perceptions. I understand now. When I used to do dilaudid 8mg at a time, 4-8 times a day and then take klonopin and soma then smoke bud. So relaxed that I gotta remember to breath. Glad to off dilaudid tho. That addiction nearly cost me my life everyday. Everyday. No rush can ever compare to that shit. Opiates actually suppress your breathing in your brain, its not that you forget to breath its that you physically cantDefinite weed meme but I like how it can be interpreted in different ways Aye so are you saying that smoking something with more thc and less of the other cannabinoids will give you less anxiety? This actually was posted on a weed page. But this is much more fitting for opiates seeing as large doses of painkillers makes it hard for your body to detect CO2, meaning your body doesnt think it needs to breathe.We're you frightened? Yeah, i wouldnt either it's just as simple to get stuff without it and take a reasonable dose to combat itch etc. It is smoother than benadryl at low doses imo. Your mouth gets so fucking dry at high doses that you have to mentally guide yourself to swallowing and breathing after too much. It weirds me out that some people down the shit with codiene. Like fuck. Isn’t that T3’s? I remember I used to do that with those. And even Vicodin. Shit tasted so foul however.You were makin homebrew my g � codeine after the APAP is out + a lil first gen antihistamines + Karo man.. that’s good homebrew Anxiety maybe?It doesn't no, when a respirator is what breaths for ODs while a cpap would do the trivk too? Nah unlikely Not sure if it does anything but it makes me feel better knowing that I stop breathing that at least some air is being jammed up my nose and hopefully making it to my lungs to keep me alive and unbraindead till my breathing kicks in or somebody notices I'm in distress. Though I usually go to manual as the original post states and the cpap sure helps on manual.Well they can do that too, (battle slow and shallow breathing) cocaine however seems not very beneficial because it starts off so quick. 

in small doses to my understanding thrt do cancel or convert symptoms but also puts amextra strain in other areaas as the heart while fentanyl iis rapidly eliminated if one makes it an hour almost half the dose would be eliminated already, adrenaline is known for being abke to stop a person fainting from pain if in a bad situation as well stims and sedatives do counter each other and if one wears out faster than the other its not good either.


One of the major issues of concern is the potential to overdose on one of the drugs as a result of taking two drugs that have different mechanisms of action. Buprenorphine, even though it is a partial opioid agonist, still has central nervous system depressant effects, and as a stimulant, Adderall results in increased central nervous system activity. When taken in combination, these two drugs cancel out some of the effects of each other, and individuals may not believe that they are achieving the desired psychoactive effects from either drug. This can lead to the potential for overdose as the person may take more to experience the effects. The situation would be most problematic in an individual who is attempting to abuse or misuse both drugs, and not in an individual who is prescribed both drugs and using them at recommended dosages.Because the buprenorphine would curb the stimulant effects of the Adderall, it would be expected that one would be more likely to overdose on Adderall than on buprenorphine; however, the situation can certainly be reversed. Overdosing on Adderall would result in a number of issues, including:

The potential for paranoia and hallucinations

Increased aggression and restlessness

Increased heart rate and blood pressure

Increased potential for heart attack or stroke

The potential for seizures

Shit, really? I thought the danger was if you took a fatal dose of downers and the uppers were all that were keeping you alive, didn't realise they can be fatal when each individually wouldn't.Opiates are arguably the most dangerous drugs out there, because both the high and the OD potential they have. They're too enjoyable and too murderous to be meddled with. It's hard to get into a recreational use without risking a more dependant usage.East coast powder, also known as china white. Its heroin mixed with fentanyl. Very light tan colorSlang for East Coast (USA) Powder..
AKA powdered #4  Heroin commonly found in the Northeastern United StatesWith weed? Absolutely.

With some synthetic cannabinoids, they bind to beta receptors in a way that causes it. Basically causes anxiety in a neurophysiological way.

Both can be mitigated with controlled breathing, and ceasing the flow of thought to induce an alpha state to calm your brain down. This works for psychogenic panic attacks too.

I can actually lower my heart rate and BP at will. I was able to do so during a stimulant OD, and have also done it in other conditions where it was measurable. I get that "manual breathing" thing under those conditions, which is probably an anxiety/panic thing.

With opiates or other CNS depressants? You're actually forgetting to breathe for real, or at least that's my understanding.

Also, lowering your heart rate is probably the opposite of what you'd wanna do, lol. I only know how to mitigate the *illusion* of "forgetting to breathe." Maybe, but I remember the first time I mixed a big dose codeine and xanax when I didn't have tolerance to either I was able to breath just fine if I mentally thought about it otherwise it just didn't seem like a priority for my brain at the time.I’ve seen people say that you physically can’t breathe before when get too respiratory depressed yet loads of people here say they manually breathe so the two can’t both be true I wonder what one is (I think you’re right with can’t otherwise people wouldn’t say it’s impossible to narcan yourself during a OD).I'm talking about synthetic cannabinoids, aka "spice." I smoked a LOT of spice from 2010 to 2013, some of it homemade from pure chem powders and leafy herb blends.

Many were trippy af. Had spiritual experiences and such with them.

They kept banning wave after wave of noid chems, so eventually all that was left were nasty ass cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic compounds. That's why I eventually stopped using them.They actually just shut down your brains autonomous response to breathe by depressing the central nervous system too much after one overdoses.Hell know, I was high as fuckRight like Lil pump says he drinks like a bottle a day. There’s no way because that promethazine will make you go absolutely bonkers. Thats a recipe for a baker act lolOver here you get cyclizine OTC, 50-100mg potentiates pretty good and I don't get a shitty hangover the next dayI know what you mean. I’ve got both obstructive and central sleep apnea, and the machine they gave me is supposed to help breath for me during central apneas. I asked the doc how it does that and they said basically by simulating my breathing patterns, by pushing some air in, then releasing the pressure it triggers the breathing response in the brain. I specifically asked them if it would act as a full on ventilator, and all the said was “it can”

Rightly or wrongly, just like you, I feel better going to sleep high when I’m hooked up to the machine. Me either, but i did some research and it turns out to be the opposite. Now i feel like an idiot for taking adderall every time I thought I took it way too far with the ECPECP is not China white anymore. China white is just fent. And not all ECP has fent, I've definitely gotten just brown. Thank you. This sounds like an animal profile in Red Dead 2. 

 But for dope. Ohhhh. OkI can see a scenario where both may be true, just at different stages or "levels" of the high. 

The impossible to narcan yourself one generally occurs when you pass out before you know its coming, or at least realize its about to hit like a train without enough time to do anything except pass out. In this scenario you would be unable to hit yourself with narcan prior to falling out.  In these instances you have no choice but to rely on those with you (if you're not alone) or being fortunate enough to wake up on your own

The other situation is where youre super high, possibly on the cusp of passing out/OD but not quite. Your breathing becomes extremely infrequent. If you have a person with you they may say something about your minimal breathing or, lack thereof.  At this point you may have become consciously aware of your situation and  be able to enter into a sort of manual breathing mode. Sounds like what people report from high doses of dimenhydrinate. I've done high doses of diphenhydramine, but Dramamine sounds like a whole different ball game.I dont like cyclazine but better than a lot. I've been prescribed it briefly but I just dont like anti cholinergics. When I take the correct dose of promethazine the hangover shit isnt so bad but benadryl or anything else basically it is worse. Cyclazine is mild compared to benadryl. Weird that beandeyl is more common in the us but of course benadryl is better for many allergies. 90% of ECP has fent. Its drug economics. If heroin is $24,000 a pound, and fentanyl is $7,000 a pound; as a drug trafficker you could add lactose, fent, and heroin to make the same potency as a dime bag of heroin, and save a lot of money. And where i’m from china is still heroin and fent together. Very rare to find pure fent, seeing as two grains of salt is a deadly amount.Haha that feeling when they sounded so smart, but they actually just crazy Lmao, yeah dude it’s all psychological somatic go from auto to Manual if you slow down your breathing to about 30 breaths per minute in a period while your blood is about 96.852 degrees Fahrenheit, to my calculations this will also work for panic attacks. Just gotta go from the beta state to alpha state and score 3 basket ball hoops and you should be good to go. 

And no I’m not being serious about this I’m just acting like the dude who commented before � who actually probably knows his shit tbh. As someone who has taken a high dose I can personally attest to how weird it is.  You will hallucinate, and I was seeing/hearing things and for like a day afterwards everything felt really weird like I was viewing everything I did in third person.We don't have soma in South Africa, but we have meprobamate it's a metabolite of soma. Not sure if it's would work the same but meprobamate is the only thing imo that makes codeine feel amazing. 3 or 4 400mg equanils an hour before your normal codeine dose and you're laying in one spot with your eyes closed in euphoria.Obviously China white isn't pure fent. Typically it's fent and a cut. And it's not 2 grains. That's carfent. I'm not even going to argue this whatever HahaOkYeah, I've never heard much of anything positive about it. I take a lot of DPH and I do DXM about once a month or so, so I mean, I fuck with OTC psychoactives. I'm sitting here coming down off a DXM afterglow from yesterday.

But dimenhydrinate is something where I don't think I've ever heard a particularly positive trip report. It's up there with datura on the "shit I don't fuck with" list. Probably a lot safer than datura, tbh, but neither sound all that appealing to me. I'm rather interested in the realistic nature of the hallucinations people get, though.

Jsyk, the "third person" thing sounds like a pretty typical depersonalization/derealization experience. I got that kind of thing a lot as a kid and it freaked me the fuck out when I was like 8, lol. Had a straight-up existential crisis in the 2nd grade. 

As an adult, though, I eventually learned that 1.) brains are weird af, and unified selfhood is a brain deal; and 2.) there's still a hell of a lot we don't even know yet about those things.

Fucking with the brain can cause some WEIRD shit, as far as selfhood and perspective goes. You can LITERALLY BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE, like subjectively. It's called Heautoscopy, and it's been documented in a few cases of people with temporal lobe or temporoparietal localized partial seizures. It's like, you're seeing your double, but you ARE both doubles. Like, at the same time. People have attempted suicide because it freaked them out that much.Dude this guy is a fuking moron lmfao... I get mad at the idiots I see posting false info on here, it’s almost too funny to comment on a lot of the timeNeither am i because clearly you’re a special kinda stupid if you think 2 milligrams (MILLIONTH OF A GRAM) is more than two grains of salt. Byee � there are 1000 mg in a gram so that would be 1/500 of a gram you stupid mother fucker lmaoWhat the fuck are you even talking about? Just a reminder that OP was being cheeky and was actually wrong af lol. God I love going through my old Reddit history. People think they’re so right but they’re actually dumber than the people they’re trying to “educate”  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: thought you guys may enjoy this, Content: , ups: 796, downs: 0https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page helps with that process.This. This right here is the kinda shit I strongly felt r/drugs was missing, thank you for the laugh.Tfw no crazy junkie gf � My dude was like “this is backwards for us”So many years of this. Except reverse because I had all the drug experience. Girl right here and yes this is true!Might be hard if too many opiates are in the mixCrossfaded ? lol I haven't heard that since 2001.

For us real junkies, it's more, "Me trying to figure out the maximum amount I can hide for myself for later, and your girl, just super excited to get another speedball shot.that moment when you realize you're so far into your addiction, that you're sex drive is completely diminished 15 mg valium and 8 beers? Fuck it let's see.Sex is exactly what you can't do while on opiates. Lol r/drugs is where this should beThat shit is all too real and exactly how I be thinking everyday...�‍���

I am going to steal this pic bro, sorry, it’s too funny!how accurate this is for my girl and i is crazy lol This has literally been my weekend 10/10 can relateIF THIS AIN'T MEI've been doing this for years with many women I've never seen this posted anywhere as I just assume we all use it. It's like my Bible. So if you don't already, you should check it out before trying anything new.What..Good memes and people who don’t think they are the supreme badasses? r/drugs is just people who think taking drugs is edgy and cool. They just wanna get internet good boy points, that's also the reason why they talk down on other users Two junkie relationships later, there was some great times but its playing with fire. Highs are high, lows are really damn devastating. 

Now, even if I'm using, I steer clear of fellow junkie gals. Clean(ish) gfs means a lot less drama, and a lot less spiraling out of control, unhealthy codependency, stealing and lying to each other, replacing sex with drugs (and maybe a half assed attempt at sex). Heroin and cocaine fueled lover's spats can get rough. why you gotta shit on the funny meme man ��You can still fuck just might have some problems getting off... coke on the other hand you might just go soft Yes,  I too have the sex/r/ihavesexI post it every chance I get, alot of people don't know about it.It's a wiki with just about every drug listed with effects, and what it is dangerous to mix with .No longer shall we stand for overdosing on weed, endless amounts of prescription pills, and the barrage of downvotes on exceeding maximum doses!! 

In all seriousness, there really should be a alternate r/drugs where the rest of the hard drug community can bond in peace (r/opiates, r/stims, and whatever else I have to sub to).That part.Thanks for this man you give perspective to a fellow lost soulSee, for me, its exactly backwards, I can get hard on coke but not finish and can't even get up on opiates, but I think the boner ability is because I take agmatine to combat the vasoconstriction.Even when I was with my ex for 4 years her friends would have me split up their shots for them I didn't have sex with all of the women I prefer to be in a relationshipI know I’m 150 days late, but this is a super handy thing to have on hand too: https://wiki.tripsit.me/images/3/3a/Combo_2.pngGreat comment then, thank you! Everyone be safe Just don't let r/lsd inLol oh okay I thought you were talking about having sex. But yeah, I too prefer sex with someone I’m in a relationship with. Never been one to like or understand those who like sleeping with someone they barely know or don’t like quite a bit or love A place where people brainwash themselves, my favourite drug but God damn do I hate the community for the most partIt doesn't even exist yet and we already turned on one another LOL.

Maybe I'm just looking for a place that everything I use is there (other than home that is).Ya I didn't think about that it sounds like I was bragging about sex I really wasn't I was talking about measuring out the dope
YeahI don't want people who think one substance is better than another, or people who hate substance abusers. The weed subreddits do it r/lsd does it, and r/drugs do it.Interesting enough though this sub hates on that community like that community hates on this one... so r/opiates is doing exactly what they dont like about r/drugs...Huh, knew that about r/drugs but damn, alright yea, no involving ourselves with that shitI don't hate all of r/drugs but there are so many people who hate substance abusers and people who use "harder" substances it gets annoying. I almost feel it's inevitable when you get that big. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Painfully real, Content: , ups: 794, downs: 0Laughs in NJfuck man, there was little I hated more than a windy winter day when I was sick back in indiana. especially the last place I lived since the gas station on my route to highway was on the outskirts of town surrounded by open fields with nothing to block that biting wind. having to step out into -20 wind-chill covered in a layer of sweat is some truly wack shit. 

but the hour drive back home from the city was almost always pretty tight. usually just me and the old running partner/best friend... so we'd finally score and find a suitable parking lot to get well. of course he hits a vein on the first attempt and sits there nodding with a cig while I struggle to find a vein, waking back up every five minutes or so to calm me down a bit and point out that the more frustrated I got the harder it would be.

if it was a good day and I managed to hit within a few minutes we'd usually move to a different parking lot to chill out and smoke a couple cigs. if it was a bad day and I took forever we just hopped back on the highway headed back home.

honestly I miss having a running partner. during the first 8 years of drug use it was almost always with my close friends. we lived an hour away from the city so carpooling was the only way any of us could afford to pick up every day or every other day. 

never had to worry about that shit back in the days of the old school oxys. I could buy oc 80s, 60s and 40s from like 5 different old ladies in my rural af hometown before they switched to the bullshit OPs and everybody just started doing dope instead.

but uh yeah, anyway. I guess my point is I also don't like the cold when I'm sick.I once bought .37 worth of gas with pennies... Got to the spot but ran outta gas on the way back.Man I truck burns a gallon of gas just sitting at a stop light It do be like that sometimesI've been there so many times, back b4 i pawned my carHow sad, but true. Ughhh I had a dealer who would text me as I’m on the way to get well again making me stop to buy him some random grocery like a gallon of milk, 3 boxes of Jell-o or a giant bottle of Mountain Dew. This is when he knew I was sick w/WD and jonesing like mad!!! I would grit my teeth and text  back, “ok” and wanna KILL HIM. I’d barely have strength to even drive there, let alone go stop off to shop for him! FuckMy boy doin this rn. I got to stay home watching hardcore Henry on Netflix I’m so lucky 

By the way I SO recommend, like, more than anything it’s excellent so much action and gore and ... ya just watch it...Story of my life manDude I’ve been there too with .25 cents. So embarrassing. What a life?!?Me in Cali except it’s fuckin 3.39Saw this last night at 2 am it was -20 c

&#x200B;I saw this on insta and laughed for like 5 mins solid bc it's my fucking life. Living out in the country, nothing is within walking distance. LMAO OMG THEM SHIVERS. FrfrWhat does it mean to be sick? For real. But the flip side is that we have to ask the gas attendant to put in a ridiculously low amount of gas in, and I dont know about you, but I always felt like they knew what was up. Are you laughing cause you don't have to get out of the car?They wont even take less than a dollar where im at lolWho remembers the guy who traded his car for a couple hundred dollars of oxy lmaoHow much ya get?

Sold a MacBook pro w retina fir 300, paid over 2k . That or the elite series of a tv fir like 200, was worth like 4k or something. My worst You get extras for buying him that shit and the extra time you put in, right? Otherwise find a new plug. A+ usernameYou maybe need to go home. This is not the place for you bro....Dopesick, presumablyI grew up in Jersey. And yeah I always felt ashamed when I had to ask for $2 of regular LMAO.That’s goes for anyone in any state. If you only have a handful of change you still have to go to the clerk and ask them to put whatever amount on whatever number tankhahahaha i felt the same way when i would bring 7 dollars in pennies and shit just to make it across town and back from the plug.[deleted]Ooof found out where i am they also require 1 dollar minimum. There was one dude who said he traded his car for like 6 norcos...he had a picture of them in the palm of his hand hahahaThats some old school reddit opi shit lmao.... I remember that for sure though, who could forget!!!? LmFAO the handful of norcos he posted who remembers that lolololFor real???I remember that threadhaha for some reason I thought it was Opanas lolThats weird i sold a 2017 mac book pro for the same price except it was my friend's... Or exfriend obviously�i got $1500 for the mazda 3. That and many years of regret.I've been asked to do shit like that so often.  Well, not asked, more like required. It was the requirement for being allowed to show up and park and sit in someone's driveway, parking lot, or street near their spot. That way you got some reason for being there, "here, I got that swisher wrap and chocolate milk you've been dying for". Also used to cover up the hand to hand exchange so anyone looking won't see the bag get handed off, since it'll be hidden beneath whatever you've been asked to bring.

I've only ever been asked to do this when I'm going into someone's neighborhood and either the plug is paranoid and/or the neighbors are nosy.

Whatever money I spent either got added to the bag or the bag just cost less. Ty, was from opiophile if u know what that is. The OG forum basically . So old, it’s gone now. There before blue light, before Reddit, before most other drug forum. They’d only allow one to create an account at Random unannounced times 2 weeks per year 

So it take years of lurking to finally get on there if u were lucky. It took me 5-6 yrs to get a login finally. Made sure there were no casual idiots on it. Shit was the best til the guy that ran it finally spent the server money on dope for the first time in like 2 decades it was sad. Run on donations. They had all the best usernames because like I said we had like 6 years to think of themI figured as much, but did not have a word for it. Thanks.

But is it slang or is it actually a physical feeling? I’ve slways wondered but never asked before. What’s is it like to leave the state and pump your own gas? 

Do some people struggle with the concept? Oh yeah, this is true. Lol I grew up in New Jersey. First time going through Connecticut, I sat in the car at the gas pump for 10 min.Do you tip them each time #OrNaw?It’s in the side bar under the epic threads It was posted on this sub yeah hahaha i wish i could find itI remember it being oxy but maybe not, that'd be slightly less dumb tho lolI've had a dude who was paranoid about coming to my neighborhood. He was black and thought he stood out (he didn't at all and black people literally live on my street), but he would bring something random every time he delivered when it was day light. I'd get peanuts, armor-all, air fresheners, and other random gas station shit.

He was my main dudes nephew and I think he was super sketched about getting arrested. It was also sad because he was like 19 and already had kids. I could tell he didn't want to do what he was doing but he did it to provide for his kids.  That’s what matters to me. What you said last. That’s perfect and a great idea of stealthy drug trade. But if it was just abuse of kindness hellnawit’s fucking hellish. you have never felt that bad in your life and you never will. it’s the worst thing i’ve ever felt. Flu like sickness brought on from opiate withdrawal. Well documented for many decades. Once you do your pill you're body reaches homeostasis again. Ive never been addicted but i drove alot of addicts to grab there pill while in deep sickness and they really do look sick. Pale, sweaty skin, sometimes vomiting until they get their pillFrom what I know (someone who's never done heroin) it's the physical feelings of minor withdrawals

Edit: guess I'm stupid �Trust me, there are more people struggling with the concept of *not* having to pump.I’m don’t live in Jersey but twice I was on the PA turnpike & had to help people pump.  Both times they were young women and had no idea how to do it.  Mid eighties is when the gas stations around us became self serve. My mother has only pumped her own gas twice in her entire life because she was married to my dad by that time. She will literally come home close to empty and have my dad drive it up to the gas station to fill her up. A couple times as a teen I had to pump her gas for her if we were out and about together. I tried teaching her but she didn't give a flying Fuck to pay attention. She's gonna be so screwed if he dies first Dont listen to them. Pumping gas sucks cock. You get gas on your shit. You walk around in formal gear and people are asking you why you smell like gas. Due to leaky fucking pumps. No one should have to pump their own gas. We need to leave that to the professionals and people who wear clothes that are already skunky.

Edit: Fuck you people who down voted me.I dreaded going into putting under a dollar of change In my tank every nightOpposite happened to me when I visited family in Jersey. Got out to pump the gas for my dad and got about as far as getting the pump in the car, then heard some gas station attendant yelling "stop, stopppp!" HahaNaw.
In Oregon we also don't pump our own gas. Never have I ever seen anyone tip the attendant. Sometimes though, at certain gas stations, I think it might be Chevron, the attendant will wash your windshield while you wait. Then sometimes someone might tip.

I always feel this weird sort of embarrassment or shame when the employee is washing the window and I'm just sitting there like trying not to make eye contact. I usually enforce that boyfriend tips, since he's the driver, whenever this happens.haha who knows. Maybe at the time I was internally hoping it was opana for his sake and then remembered it that way.Damn. Intense Its sad you all do this to yourselvesy’all lost?Thank you for sending_it Yup. I was dumbfounded when I found out pumping your own gas is illegal there. Still am honestly. What death or catastrophic event occurred for it to be made illegal?I live in Florida and my grandmother never learned to pump gas. I remember driving around forever, looking for a full service station. �[deleted]Wow it sounds like your mom is just making things like 10x more complicated and difficult for herself. I don’t think anyone taught me how to pump gas, it’s prettt self explanatory. It’s like the same concept as turning on a faucet or getting soda out of a fountain even though they’re different setups. She must think it’s like way more involved than it actually is and not want to learn cause then she’d have no excuse to not do it herselfI’ve been pumping my own gas since the early 80’s I can count on three fingers the number of times I’ve gotten gas on me.  Keep purel in the glove box, smell problem solved.  Man up.  Mass has both. It's a weird experienceI always feel like I should tip them. My aunt says she doesn’t, but she lives there. Also I’m only ever in NJ for the holidays when it’s cold as shit. Child, don’t judge things you do not understand.  nobody wants to be an addict. The fuck outa here with that shit ‘birdeey’[deleted]It’s not a safety thing it’s a job thing. It's an insurance thing mostly. Something about how they rates are lower because they're full service. Had someone to do with the population density if I remember when they were training us. Creates jobs too. In Virginia we used to have gas stations with a single lane that was full service and the rest were self serve. In the 80s, all gas stations had full service pumps, slowly over time less and less of them had full service pumps. Now in 2018 all gas stations here are 100% self serve. 

I bet if you opened a station in VA that had 100% full serve and had girls on rollerskates pumping the gas with the HESS colors , white t-shirts with a green miniskirt and tight white bootie shorts, you’d make a fucking killing. 

[Hess service station for adults.](https://i.imgur.com/9hYIGqt.jpg)My grandma was exactly the same. My Grandpa always made sure she had a full tank, lol The woman gave me life so I would definitely help her if she ever needed it. Plus she is such a kickass grandma to my kids that I'd have no problem running up for her while we all visit, but it's just more of a hassle for her to not learn herself. She's a very smart woman too which is why I don't get it. Yeah she tends to do that with a couple other things, like plugging in the Comcast to watch Netflix on the main TV. We wrote down instructions to a T and she still drives my sister crazy asking her to do it. 

The first time she pumped her own gas was when she was 9 months pregnant and with her foreign mother in law. My grandma was asking random men to help them and my mom says it was an embarrassing moment to figure it out, I think it was on an older pump too. She was shocked when I asked for her card and swiped at the pump! She really had no idea you didn't have to go inside to pay � That doesn't solve the problem of stepping on it and your shoes smelling like it for the rest of the night.Lived and worked in Jersey for a while as a gas station attendant at Wawa.  People would tip all the time. Loved it. Especially around the holidays. People always talk about the "physical" symptoms.  Though they are terrible, it is the "mental" part that fucks w me.  Sooooo depressed--like the end of the world hopelessness.  Soooo "introspective" (which can be kinda fun/ good / interesting), so... just terrible.  On top of that, most poeple (me) CANNOT sleep.  No matter what.  The ONLY thing which will give you that relief is an opiate.  

Add to that what others said:  especially the nausea.  You CANNOT eat.  I CANNOT even *drink* anything w/o puking--at least during the worst of it (around 36 hours or so).  My only hope is (if possible where I am) to lie in the shower until the hot water runs out, then just lie there until it become warm again--repeat.  That, or watch movies.  Talking to other humans is epsecially helpful during this stage, though, ost, unless they know what's up, will not likely want to be near you. 

There are multiple, accurate portrayals of heroin addiction and its sickness.  I think the most accurate I've ever watched was *Panic in Needle Park* (it's an older film--1970s) starring Al Pacino.  Really good, but, ofc ourse, quite depressing.  That does sound awful I'm confused, is that shorts under the miniskirt? What's the point no one would see them cause the skirt would be in the way[deleted]She knows how to pump her own gas lol She is just playing dumb so that she doesn't have to do it. And if she pretends to let you teach her, then she will have to pump her own gas.Have been pumping my own gas in Philly for over a decade and a half, this doesn’t happen to people. You’re tripping.I get the mental shit first and I end up not even caring about the physical as much. I had ways to ease some of the symptoms but I wouldn't even want to eat or drink anything in the first place. I used to dry heave until  sticky yellow bile would come out. So glad I'm clean almost a year now. Fuck that state of mind.I'm with you in the shower thing. I would drive my ex crazy getting up every hour and a half to go back in until the hot water ran out again. You could tell by our utility bill when we had a rough month by our water bill going up So does sexfartI meant to say “[Boy Shorts](https://goo.gl/images/KaqQNe)” which are a type of women’s underwear. I mean, they’re gonna be outside, they probably want underwear under their skirts. The girls need their dignity. 

The skirts in my imagination are not right but like more open and comfortable to skate in. [Like this. ](https://www.charlotterusse.com/pleated-scuba-skater-skirt-302557907.html?mrkgcl=776&mrkgadid=3037755296&cid=ps:nonbrand:Google&product_id=302557907&adpos=1o5&creative=227505038395&device=m&matchtype=&network=s&gclid=CjwKCAiAuMTfBRAcEiwAV4SDkd7zM6xzLwUGWsr_z1NUIrckPBd312mcAVS1fRjoOQLb7DFeNp9nwRoCJ48QAvD_BwE)I guess you would see the bloomers (not bootie shorts) when the girls bend over, like cheerleaders wear. Thanks, I'm actually a girl but I'm still taking the compliment! My mom battled cancer when I was a teen so my sister turned down a scholarship to be close to her. She's healthy now but I feel same as you do about moving far away, it isn't worth it. 

Growing up we spent every Sunday visiting both of my grandparents one after the other for the afternoon. Once I got to a certain age I was annoyed by the "tradition ruining my weekend" but still went. Once my mom's mother died, my aunts who barely saw my grandma all felt so guilty. They visit her grave all the time and regret not seeing her. They wanted her stuff to remember her by, but we have actual good memories with her. I made it a point after that to see my dad's mom regularly. We celebrated her 95th birthday last Sunday! 

Sorry for getting way off topic here, but family isn't around forever and it's great you value your time with them now! So you're saying gas never leaks on the ground or out of the nozzle down your car? That's complete and absolute bullshit. I no longer live in Jersey and pump my own has every day practically. What your claiming is bullshit. Hell just yest I watched some teenager pull the nozzle out prematurely and spray has all along the side of his car and on the ground.Hahah nice :)Maybe let your tard wrangler do it instead. Do you also fling food and drink everywhere during feeding time?Maybe if ur an idiot it happens but if u have half a brain it's not hard to keep it clean... just takes some god damn common sense is all... 

Make sure the pump isn't fucked up b4 using, put the nozzle in as far as possible b4 pumping, keep ur hand away from the lever/trigger when removing the nozzle and watch where u step when ur walking around a pump... not rocket science, and if a few drops get on ur car or urself, it's called paper towel or a rag. 

Oh but wait, if u really wanna show off ur common sense gas pumping skills, when ur done pumping, if u push in or up (depending on the design of the gas pump) on the little metal flap that moves when u stick the gas pump nozzle back into the holder on the machine, it will shut off the pump and not allow u to pump anymore gas without paying again first so this would keep from any accidents happening between u removing the nozzle from ur car and putting it back into its holding slot on the machine. 

I will say tho that the video clips of people driving off from the pump with the nozzle still in their car are fucking hilarious when they show them on the news... like u gotta be absent minded af to do some shit like that... or extremely high.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Way too accurate, Content: , ups: 791, downs: 0For me, this is just me sober (past 30 days as well)For me it’s when I start to think about how I got to this point. the struggles a head how I wish I could magically have 6 months go by. I hate the mental part. First year sober*This is too right. Ugh I just want my energy back. The hardest part for me is having no fucking energyDamn I miss this show. Me at work,  right now...Eating food: this taste like shit 
Listening to music: this doesn’t sound good 
Watching tv: this isn’t entertaining. I’m anxious 

Relapsing? Sounds amazing. 

Ah yes. Life returns. It's you. It's that shit stuck under my shoe, it's that smell inside the van, it's my bed sheet covered with sand ...fr after one year dry, those relate more to my drinking than sobriety. hang in there y’allThis is me everyday sober. Does it ever not feel this way...¡¡¡All y'all need VIVITROL!!!It really do be like that sometimesSame here ! Get through the physical part is hard but the mental part is the worst ohh gosh i’m 5 days sober and The depression is awful .. It does come back. Took me about six months. No joke. Get a prescription for vyvanse.That was the worst for me as well. Having low energy was one of the main reasons for getting into opiates. When it was taken away I became an unbelievable slob. The wierd thing was my mind was still going so I read a lot of books, which also helped with the depression.That first shot in the morning just gets you up and ready to face the world. Such a good energy boost. yes!!! I’m glad I’m not alone. The lack of energy energy is the WORST part of it Check dailymotion. The 90s are there.I just did a shot in the bathroom at work. Now in just sitting on the toilet relaxing before I go back into the kitchen and work. I literally only ate Reese’s puffs, apples, and ice cream which are foods I’ve never liked otherwise. 

Watching tv was barely less excruciating to make the time pass than watching paint dry. Ah, great song, only realized recently that it was about kicking dope, since loving it since I was 13 or 14 (I'm in my 30s, BTW).I aint gettin I aint gettin outta bed todayUntil u get in a car wreckThey need to re-up their natural endorphin production. Not fucking block it. You sound like those drug court shit bags Good for you man!!!! 5 days, feels like it’s been 2 weeks don’t it?. If you are trying to get clean, and ur about go see the man, just remember how long and hard it was just to get to 5 days. And if you fuck up, that’s part of it too. Sometimes we need to fuck up a few times to realize it’s not worth it.  I got 4 weeks and I got downvoted like a mother fucker but adderall is what helped me. Got me moving and productive. Hmm? Kinda like that dope I was banging or them 30s I was popping. Some people take Xanax but that just keeps you lying down and when we’re lying down, you can only sleep so much so what else is their to do? think . That’s fucked up mix, dope sick and thinking to much. But whatever it takes. I wish, my doctor will not give me anything addictive. He’s been my psych for 10 years and knows all the dirt I did...well a lot of the dirt haha. I got some addys a few days back and low mg like 5-10 helped but they are too expensiveI’m reading and watching a lot of docs. Fuck I watched “minding the gap” and cried. Like really cried. I’m not the crying type mind you, not the “manly” type but just was on opiates for so long I could never really cry. That’s another thing is the emotions; holy shit. It sucks because like you said, my mind is fucking rolling along but my body feels like I have weights on and am walking under water. I’m over itTell me about it. Wake ups were the best but I have kids now so...Risky, I once found an employee face down on the ground in the bathroom after nodding off. He was gone for 30min on a 10 min break. 

In retrospect, I should have fired him for drug use at work but he hooked me up instead so I let it slide. I'm 28. I fell in love with the riff of Greatest Hits; had to know the band, asked who made that song.

Now, many of their songs speak to me.Vivitrol actually blocks it? That’s kinda sounds bad if you’re actually trying to get clean with that. Sounds miserable It is a free country. What one doctor will not do? Another doctor will.

If your dumb ass gets addicted to every substance and never takes meds as prescribed, then you will have a hard knock life.Yeah, ticking all the boxes. I only realised how much was being suppressed after I quit. Sense of humour came back really strong, which was great. I used to sit watching stupid videos of people falling over and laughed myself silly. It got to the point that my wife started doubting my sanity but it felt so good to laugh again.Modern times call for modern solutionsThis happened to my best friend at work, pants down and everything. Except he overdosed+has a seizure or something. Had to call ambulance. He came to, and convinced the job that he just had a seizure, but they drug tested him. Funny thing is, he was doing straight fentanyl-which I guess didn't show up on the drug test, but marijuana did, so he got fired for weed. Even though he does have a seizure disorder, and technically weed would help that. Hahaha, amazing!Vivitrol stops alcohol addicts and opiate addicts from feeling the high of their drug. It will not prevent overdose. Why do you think police and fucked courts are completely in love with the garbage? Thank youYes! The only thing that got me through the first two weeks of subs was watching comedies and stupid YouTube vids but it did feel good to “feel”.  Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. They probably knew. Though it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. And the weed was a good enough reason to let him go.Oh that sucks... if someone somehow didn’t know that they could be just slamming or doing heroin till they OD and not realize it. Also Doesn’t it make alcohol addicts also puke it up too?
Honestly no clue. I’ve never known anyone or dealt with the drug court personally. It sounds terrible though. Everyone I met in rehabs that tried it hated eat. 

Also I heard they use something or the same thing for booze? Anti Abuse. 

Shit sucks. Subs or Done is the way to Vivtrol in concept seems like it would work well however it doesn’t help any mental aspects you’re not fixing or repairing a behavior just simply not allowing it idk. It was mentioned to me once and I said FUCK THATAnd Survive.  Some opiate addicts HAVE overdosed to death tryna overcome the vivitrol blockage. :-( Never be like them. Doctors warn not to do anymore opiates before they inject addicts with vivitrol, but  stupid mofos will take their chances regardless.


MANY booze-loving redditors report that naltrexone's side effects include mild nausea and dizziness the first couple of times it is taken orally. After day 3, it is usually smooth sailing.It's different than anibuse. Anibuse only makes you sick from alcohol. Vivitrol blocks endorphins. Apparently something happens to opioid receptors when you drink that makes ya wanna continue knocking em back. It's supposed to take the fun outta drinking along with everything else in your life. I've NEVER delt with drug courts personally but the one in my town forces that bullshit into your viens. Whilst having you do hard manual labor for community service. It's completely fucked. Most only last a few months. 2 people total. Like in the entire history of my towns drug court have completed it @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Dead ass teachers, Content: , ups: 775, downs: 0"Mooooom! Staaaahp! I don't want percs with my pb&j *again* :C"Just once I want someone to pop out of nowhere and be like, "hey man, wanna try heroin? First hit's free." Yes things like aspirin.advil and or a cup of coffee. Maybe a pull off a doobie or a mixed drink. These are the awesome free drugs you will be getting all the time!I sincerely blame the DARE program for doin more to fuck up my life than anything.  My school made us sit through quarterly DARE assemblies 1st to 12 th grade.

They made me believe all drugs would kill me, fry my brain cells, and turn me into a complete scum bag who'd shank my mother for a weed rock. No thats not a typo.

When you're young and only have access to biased information full of lies, misinterpretations, and just plain incorrect information, it's pretty much guaranteed anybody won't have the ability to understand the actual reality of the issue.


By the 10th grade, many of us realized nearly all of what we heard was bullshit.  Unfortunately, their abhorrent and preposterous misinformation had forced to think everything they said was a lie.  We believed it was just more lies and opiates were jus like weed, booze, coke, etc, hallucinogens....

Everyone partied hard with all those never having the substances effect their lives at disastrous levels. Maybe you got an under age or a weed possession/ parapahnaelia charge. Whoop dee doo. Pay a fine, do some community service, piss clean for at max a year for probation.


We still excelled at school, we still worked as many hours as allowed, we still had a part in society.


So opiates were just another drug to enjoy right....

Nope. Goodbye school. Forget about working. You have one job after dependancy....to score. More times than you'll ever imagine, at the worst times when you just want to die on a couch. You'll shit your pants, puke yellow bile on your lap in between relentless sneezing, all while trying to wipe your eyes enough to keep your swerving on the pavement, furthermore of importance, staying on the pavement so your bile puke soaks into your changeable clothes and doesn't permanently stank your car up.


If DARE would have been honest and told the truth, there's no way I would have eagerly jumped my way into daily opiate use. No way I would have picked up that needle.  I was happy with jus using everything else. I had over 15 K in the bank. A good job, a house, a car, a hott gf. I went on vacations and saw rock gods multiple times a week.



Now I do opiates. I don't have any real friends left who don't think they're superior to me and the rest chose tiny amounts of hard drugs over our friendships decades old.


I'm a typical situation. Society helped create me, yet they will do anything to make sure I disappear by having all odds thrown at me.

The second back stabbing,common to all my peers is the criminal,justice system.

It'd be a lot easier to stay clean if people had acceptable level paying jobs.....ahhh but ya see folks..... Remember those kids jus partying and smoking weed around college age?

 Guess what, that tiny weed charge that is supposed to be expunged and not visible in the future?

 Lies. You won't be getting hired without nepotism even with a internship and over 3.0 gpa. Why? Cause you once WERE A DRUGGY RAMPAGING ON MARIJUANA.

and yes, you served your mandated punishment, but nobody will find any merit with that. Also, youll be forced to pay 80% of your paycheck weekly toward paying for the privilege of probation, don't forget your fines! Ill add those are subjective and the judge can slam you for extra thousands for,your large cubic zirconia in your ear. After all, if you got a diamond that big kiddo....


So yes. You'll be paying for all this and for a middle aged disgruntled probation officer to bully you, take out his horrible life frustrations, and don't forget you're a target they actually have full power over..... When have people with unmonitored power ever decide that power doesn't suit them?

 So,You'll have to hand your piss over with a yes sir right after he stares at your dick and scrutinizes your urine.

You'll fail and owe mote fines, get probation extended, and finally last infraction serve out the whole recommended sentence of your crime.

Mine was a year and 8 months for having 6.8 grams of weed in one bag. I had it in my buttoned cargo pocket while I was  jogging for exercise in a neighborhood.....turns out some victim didn't tecognize me as livin near so as I was jogging by her house with a book bag on the police had 3 units take this hardened 20 year old down,

I was then held in the pouring rain for 4 hours, 12 at the station, all being interrogated without a phone call or allowed to leave. The affidavit stated I was running from the scene of a crime and when they stopped me to interview me I went for my wallet and pulled out a large bag of weed so now they had rights to search me.

They were convinced my old Chinese zune rip off was the walkie talkie I had warned my team with. They were utterly convinced.  I was,jogging to a buddies house a mile up the road.


Since that day I've been a criminal first to society. I get turned down for nearly every job despite having 2 degrees and one is a master's. In always over,qualified..... Yet I'm a accumulation of the charges they gave. A weed smoking burglar who had all charges except the weed thrown out. The search should have been to.


On top of that, I fight way harder than average Joe. After all, I picked up a heroin habit after probation forced me to stop smoking weed. I used it for anxiety. Every night since 14 after all obligations were completed.

I was forced to use drugs undetectable by urine after a few days. After all, every 2 weeks or month I pissed for this dipshit literally sniffing my piss for anything to bust me wit. Then he'd get a pat on the back and maybe have a chance at becoming a cop.....


Don't forget I'm paying for this probation...135 a month. Ohhhh I fail for weed one more time and I serve a year in jail? For 6.8 grams of weed? Hmmm ya. Looks like ill jus have to keep doing these opiates...

 I MEAN AFTER ALL, THEY'RE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER DRUG I'VE DONE AND USED. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC FOR ME TO LEARN FROM YET....

DON'T WORRY FUTURE ADULTS, ME AND MY FRIENDS BECAME THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC POSTER MODELS SO YOU ALL COULD LEARN FROM OUR HELL.

thanks DARE, thanks. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. You condemned millions of us and yet you still are out there every #day hounding us in any shape you can.  We would have been better off with a punishment of exile, a punishment of being ostracized.  Just like my boy Pericles. Saves all of western civilization only for jealous political enemies ( rich ones you can't forget) to call for a vote and then rig the results to ensure common birth born, humble hero of the battle at the straits of thalamus...ostracized for life so the poor lose their political voice and the rich take back all power.

Nothing has changed. Fuck you and your criminal justice system America. You have no morals. You have no ethics. You only have money.

Exhale. PhewSome people say cucumbers taste better pickled...I give my homie free H sometimes, so I can feel like I'm not the only one fucking up shit.No one is too cool for drugs. But you can definitely be NOT cool enough for drugs. For some reason, Michael Scott comes to mind lol. My mom used to say this, and it was true in some way, the first time I smoked weed was free, my first line of coke, well, multiple lines, were free, same with dope, the first time i did opis, my new friend at the time asked me if i knew what they were, i said no, and it was the truth, he gave me an 80mg oxy, i almost threw up at the school library, i was feeling so confident I asked a girl to go to prom with me.Clearly y’all never been in a Long Beach public bathroom. Meth as far as you can see. To be fair, first time I used weed and cocaine and opiates I did not have to pay. 

My friend hooked up my first few bags of weed. I got him back

First line of coke I ever did was pretty early on in life and it was after a shift at my first job when this 40 year old pulled me into the washroom stall with him and put a CD case in front of me with some shiny ass coke on it and said to do a line. Let me tell you that line was the best of my life, and it was free! I was 16 lol 

First opiate was codeine and Percocet tabs that my weed homie had and hooked me up with a baggie of like 10 percs and 20 t3 after I bought the guy fast food after a sesh 

But the coke was the only real, “hey come here kid and fuck up your life” I asked for the weed and pills 

Funny that I don’t do coke, only weed and pills to this day lolBeing a hot girl means getting tons of free coke but everyone's still always so stingy about opiates  :(Dead ass doctors ..Stoner's are great at sharing!! I'm pretty sure no one ever paid for their first sesh =)

My first few weed/pills/acid/shrooms/ coke were all free, actually- I've never paid for shrooms (they grow around here) or coke... (granted I've only had like 5 nights on coke- but I'm a downer kid ;) (& fuck I'd be fucked if I loved coke enough to buy it, the price of coke in Australia is fucking obscene..... which I guess means I should be even more grateful that folks wanted to fund me getting fucked up)



Hhheeeyyyyyyy, you guys would know the answer to this,


Would prescription oxycodone + prescription dexamphetamine = pharma speed ball?? 


(Have you done it? Was it any good? Is it actually dangerous, or just have a bad rep?)

Sure I can google things, but I like the personal stories  you folks can share ♡ ♤Good friends share!I haven’t taken up any offers I haven’t felt like having a solid conversation with a tree yet. Today was the first time in my 10 years of doing drugs, that a complete stranger gave me free drugs. Unfortunately doesn’t happen nearly as often as I was told it would happen. Well, I mean most females I know never spend a dime My best friend is like a 6’3 tattooed ken doll and he use to hook up with this butterface that was prescribed those 30mg ER adderal and she would always give him a handful after they hooked up and he always split them with me .. good ass friend 

Edit - thanks for the silver anon Wow I’ve never done that before, sure! If you live in a city with an open-air drug market the d boys throw out testers to get the word out on a new batch

Edit: got rid of locationYea and I don’t like smoking weed and not much of a drinker either ... once in awhile I’ll have a nice beer with dinner ... usually a stout or a sour You don't hang out with cool enough people . I get offered everything: pills, coke, acid, weed or ketamine even. Not even sucking any dick I swear!I feel this. I was Rock solid with $40k in the bank great job and career. Started on the opiates and years and 2 misdameanor charges later I can't get a job due to my background. Even with a 15+ yr career with an excellent professional track record. Those positions that will consider someone with a light record (generally smaller companies) won't hire me because I'm over qualified... Stuck between a fucking Rock and a hard place with no resources or options to generate income to break the cycle. Disheartening at times man but keep fighting.Honestly, the dare program made me realize what drugs were and since then I've been "HOLY WOW I WANNA TRY THAT TOO"Yeah, that's why I have to get mine through the mailhttps://i.imgur.com/dZGy6WD.jpgI’ve gotten free bags at sketchy gas stations waiting on my dope man. Closest I’ve ever gotten to that.Who is giving you free meth in the bathroom? Whut?> Would prescription oxycodone + prescription dexamphetamine = pharma speed ball??
> 
> (Have you done it? Was it any good? Is it actually dangerous, or just have a bad rep?)

Have done this many times. It's a great mix but just watch your doses, don't take more oxy than you would normally for your tolerance and you should be fine safety-wise. 

The actual mix itself is not where the danger comes from, the danger comes from the possibility of using more oxy than you can actually handle because the effect is being masked by the stim. Then the stim wears off, the opiate takes over, and you feel the full dose and possibly OD.

So keep your oxy dose at your usual rate and you should avoid this risk.

That said dex has about the same duration as oxy anyway assuming both are IR, so it's not as dangerous as a speedball with coke imo, since coke only lasts like 30 mins it's far easier to get into danger speedballing it.

But yeah for me I take dex in the morning to wake me up and as a super laxative haha. Then I used to take oxy on top when I used it. Was always a good time. But I made sure to never overdo the oxy.Not gonna say its safe but its not going to give you a heart attack. From what I understand they work on different systems of the body so they dont interact with each other besides the insane synergy. In my experience it was great and the opiate is perfect for when you start coming down from the amph type drugIn my home state we call adderal + oxy a suburban speedball Hahaha similar story. I was dating a girl who had a 70mg vyvanse prescription, and she said that every orgasm I gave her she would give me one. 

I think the record was over ten orgasms in a night. I wanted that vyvanse lmaoThis makes me sad bc I've done this before for percs back in the day.What is a butterface?"Try? First? Yeah, uh, whatever you say man, I'll take it."From the sidebar:

Psh.... Ya ain't gotta lie to kick it. At uni I always got given free drugs. One of my mates joked I was treated like a girl when it comes to drugs cuz of all the freebees haha. I even got free OC80's a few years ago. 

Nowadays not so much tho unless I get extras on a DNM order or like what happened today a pharmacy accidentally gave me 200 DHC instead of 100 lmao.

Oh I did get free tapentadol recently but that stuff is fucking shit.

>ketamine

Always a good one, mixes well with opiates too. One of my best drug experiences was oxy + ket. Probably not safe I know but can't say it wasn't fun.It sure is a fucked situation. I've dealt with the same shit. Even sayin you'll take lower pay doesn't work because normally they're using it as a cop out. I've even experienced ageism more than a few times. Apparently facial hair is a solid determinant of employee productivity. I get patronized til they know my age and then, " dude this, dude that, that's super " insert random youth slang on the recent side or one only used on MTV and FM radio POP stations"

I had people report unfriendly, unwelcoming, low energy, bad attitude, and stuff along those lines all in response to co workers interpreting my reactions as difficult/non team based personal projection.


Reality was I really had zero intuition what BAE stood for if it wasn't babe, and apparently I treated someone like " u left me on read and I had to be sipping tea trying not to go Cray without my curls"

 How isn't the normal response to the latter of that " what in the. Kind of Forrest gumping stupid ass morons are you? Did you eat slim joms for dinner and watch jerry Springer to make your family seem normal?

 What kind of 40 year old uses hundo pee dog ( hundred percent) to confirm they'll start your requests.....then he kept using " woke" " bad" and "eeeew barb must be on fiiii yah! Oh icedteas shirt would set the sprinklers off! Where's fire men when you need them? Woot woot.

This stupid mother fucker doesn't understand earl grey is a popular British tea. It's not a,sayin. He must have kept hearing someone quickly say you got me sippin tea like I'm earl grey.

 -& actually explaining where the risk is helps, totally makes sense when you put it that way....

I have a super high tolerance to the oc (been on it for nearly 10 years, a combo of genetic disorder & serious MVA that destroyed my life- even on a 'high daily dose' I am still in constant severe pain.... I never have enough oc to actually get high from it, & I haven't used the dex recreationally since I was in highschool lol- so thanks for the education /harm reduction tips... (I could totally see myself as one of those newbs who just kept taking more oc because I'm so used to it, & haven't had the dex in well over a decade lol.... I will definitely keep that in mind when I go adventuring!! Thanks again =) ☆

Cool, thanks heaps for taking the time to reply, & share your experiences with the upper + downer combo �Hah, that has a nice alliterative sound to it =)Very coolMy manHow the fuck is this comment upvoted? People who make comments like yours are almost virgins. Come on dude...Also had a girl with a 70mg vyvanse Rx, shit kept me sane during IB tests I took during my senior year of high school. A chick with a hot body and an ugly face i.e. "I liked everything butterface (but her face)"r/butterface It is a stupid term that ugly ass men use that can't get a date any other way. Get a haircut, bitches.“I bet if you gave me 2 free lines I’ll get addicted and come back for more” My bad, I figured it was ambiguous enough. Edited. Huh, this is new. I've definitely posted city specific stuff in the past.A friend of mine got sent 600mg of not etizolam instead of 50mg of etiz. I don't know what the fuck it was, but he gave me a fucktone and I lost about 4 days of my life.

Sorry to hear about your severe pain though man.

Interestingly there's this woman I know who says her husband gets pain relief from amphetamine. So I gave her a few dex to share between them and sure enough she said it helps his pain. No idea how but found that curious.Kinda plays on the fact you might be picking both of those up from stay at home mothers in the burbs making a little extra cash lol Man, amphetamines are THE BEST for sex! Everyone knows that!! Unless, of course, they don't... �They didn’t even get it right. None of those girls even had nice bodies. That’s part of it. Everything but her face = butterface.

If you're not willing to rationally lay out the undebatable facts into an argument that proves how incredibly uninformed they are, you are un worthy of living in the benefits of a society who embraces logic and critical thinking over misinformation, propaganda, and hate directed at substance users.

I do not accept alcohol as an acceptable societal intoxicant. Yet I would never infringe on anyone who safely indulges and doesny hurt anyone,with his use.

This is the only type of ethics that will fix the war on drugs. 
If you-

- do not believe in the legalization of drugs, you are bathed in propaganda.  Your sense of righteousness is decades behind and still influenced by conservative bible belt bullshit beliefs that never hold up to intelligent analysis.  These people still haven't separated their views, their self worth/ their morality from the church and conservative viewpoints.  If you as an adult cannot establish your own set of commandments to live by that most importantly doesn't effect anyone else negatively, than you shouldn't have a voice in any argument.

... me neither Sort by top man, some of those gals definitely have good bodies.I would be dead, but the supplier wasn't selling any opiods so it wasn't really possible. Pretty sure it was something like deschloroetizolam or some other weird analogue like that. We couldn't positively identify it, but it was pretty clearly a GABAergic drug.

Somehow understandingly regular RC suppliers and fent ones don't really mix. They're even banned from some onion market. So you don't just stumble into fent.No you are right it is not an excuse and I agree with most of what youre saying. I've just given up personally trying to change them. I would say 1 in a 100 people like that are ready for a change but Ive never had luck with people leaning too far to one side or another. People like that need a life changing event to push them out of their narrow point of view and even that isnt a given.Yeah I know it's usually pointless but maybe it's just what one of those fuck nuts needs to wake up and love their fellow human.
.sure does get tiresome tho.

That's why I sail heroin on the open waves of my badly lit heroin bath tub. Yes I feel you, drugs are the way I cope with it too. Only intellectuals get depressed my man we are in the minority.

Funerary enclosures for excarnation? And don't even tittle my wanker and bring up the wood circles. You wizardry brits, I wish I lived through your late Neolithic and early bronze age.

All the suboxone memes and jokes r old and stale. Haven’t seen this one. Ever. Awesome. Haha I feel better now that I saw this Laughed out loud.Facts as fuck lol“The cure for the common junkie’Gold. Jerry it's gold! True true And to the traditionally sober folks, "recovery but it's gay". Suboxones just out there trying to help can't get any love. lol.sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn’t. fuckin’ way she goesI’m laughing so hard at this oh man it just made my day thank you OP love u����Lmfaohahahaha holy shit that's classic.Fucking classic���lmao..so accuratei don't think I even get it and I stil laughed my ass off[deleted]Subutex is much better. It's Buprenorphine minus the Naloxone which is what Suboxone is.Heroin but it’s gender fluidI don’t get this That was descriptive WordFuck the haters bro. 30 days without whatever you were taking is impressive even taking subs.  What the fuck do people expect, cold turkey from heroin?? Say word!  Congrats! Fuck the rest. I did 9 years on subs and been off and on 3g Kratom for nearly 18 months now. Keep killin. Subutex is a narcotic so you are not sober, you are just 30 days without heroin Happy to brighten your day :)LMAO yesDoes your bible say anything about getting drunk and playing VLTs there ray?

It's open to interpretation Julian yes.Right? Then you couldn't share needles and have gay sex.Really? Cause i have the option to take wither should i be doing subutexThanks man I appreciate it!Come on dude... I hate these arguments My bad didnt realize I was in an na meetingIf anything he is 30 days sober and currently on (semi-synthetic) opiates. Sobriety is a state of mind — stability, relative inner peace, etc. It’s so subjective that it’s useless and downright detrimental to claim ownership over a definition.Yes, a narcotic that helped me turn from a quasi-suicidal heroin addict into a person with goals. I was good at hiding my heroin habit,  but I do not have to hide the results of my suboxone use because it does not require that kind of work and deception. I’m dependent on buprenorphine but what difference would there be in my behavior if I was sober? 

If you have experience being on and off suboxone, I’d love to hear what difference you noticed.Buprenorphine is an opiateIt's still an opiate. Are you dense?Currently rewatching madmenAll I want to do is get high and mow lawns in the trailer park, and that’s okay. [deleted]Suboxone is Subutex+Naloxone. So hench the name SUB(Subutex)OXONE(Naloxone). Suboxone is safer but Subutex is a better...high I suppose. I don't fuck with it too much as I enjoy my H without any addiction. But my buddy got off the H and bangs Subutex all the time and loves it.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\* - The question of whether you should be doing Suboxone or Subutex is up to you. One's safer and the other is stronger. But both are relatively safe. So that's up to you and depends whether you're looking to get off someone or to get something from it.It is better than heroin don’t get me wrong, but if you think you’re sober while using this drug you are out of your mind Fuck meetings. But sorry the truth stings a bit.You could also argue being high is a state of mind and that I get high every day without using drugs. While this can be a true statement, it’s just hiding the other fact of the meaning of being high while under the influence of narcoticsNo, it’s not. He is 30 days heroin free while he uses a crutch to mask his sobriety and trick him into thinking he’s actually sober when in reality he is high everyday.I have plenty of experience with both. I will be 4 years clean from opiates this November. I used to think being on subs was sober, until I finally got out of that trap long enough to clear my head. You are still high while on suboxone. It is not an easy thing to do and almost impossible to imagine being in that state, but once you are clean long enough you will understand.It’s different than the opiates he was taking and if you don’t understand that or what I meant by the post then you are extremely denseey b0ssI’ve always personally believed that the naloxone doesn’t do anything it’s bioavailability is very low orally and bup has a much higher binding affinity than naloxone. > I don't fuck with it too much as I enjoy my H without any addiction.

That’s what literally all of us said about our drugs of choice too.  Spoiler alert: most people are just deluding themselves and have gotten addicted without realizing it.Suboxone is not safer, it's more dangerous since the naloxone can damage your liver and it's definitely not preventing overdoses.Nah, you’re just indoctrinated into an archaic idea of sobriety and recovery that hasn’t seen a revision since the Big Book first came out in ‘39. I’m gonna side with positive clinical results and general science.But it seems to have absolutely no psychological or physical effect other than the initial relief of sickness? That’s why I consider it sober, it seems to have no effect on my state of mind and I therefore do not co sided myself to be ‘using’. For me it has been amazing at stopping cravings and the constant thoughts about using. My life is totally back to normal now, yeah I have to take a mrs every day but it’s the same with my anti depressants. I am never high and my life is not the chaotic mess it was while using.Said the guy that runs na meetingsBullshit, if you are a true addict, on hard shit, Subs don't get you high. I wish they fucking did, but they don't. So, yes, that's absolutely clean time. They arent getting high off the shit, they are taking a prescribed medicine that keeps receptors full and keeps sickness and cravings at Bay, nothing more. If they aren't getting high, that's fucking clean time. You can take your bullshit idea of what you think truth is and shove it up your ass.I’m high on endorphins from my morning run (way stronger than any pill or H), does that mean I’m not sober?  I mean, I FEEL high. It feels good. Please, internet stranger, define my state of mind for me. Could you elaborate - I find the idea of being high every day at the moment weird, because I feel absolutely sober. How exactly would you describe your state of mind on subs and off them?You edited your comment. It originally said "clean from opiates", not "clean from heroin"
Anyhow, you're just being a douche to somebody in recovery by undermining their success. I thought I'd poke fun at your pisspoor wording.I'm talking mainly about shooting here Naloxone supposedly only becomes active if u shoot it. Since I break my doses up, I prefer Suboxone. The pills are hard to get broken in perfect doses. Plus it always seems to throw my tolerance off compared to the stripsYeah thanks dude I'm very moved by that little speech \*yawns intensely\* Naloxone isn't preventing overdoses?

&#x200B;No actually I’m just spitting facts, sorry if they are hard to handle. Not being honest is the greatest downfall of the opioid crisis. You are not sober until you are completely off everything.Right on! You only believe you are not high because that is what you are being told and you have nothing to compare it to. It has an incredible effect on your psyche. If this is ok for you then by all means continue to use. But don’t be tricked into thinking you are thinking clearly and soberly.If you think an endorphin high and an opiate high are similar you are a moronSuboxone is a narcotic it clouds your brain and judgement. While this seems like an incredible jump from the clouds heroin can cause in your brain- if you want to in fact be truly sober you have a long way to go to come out of that fog. Again, I couldn’t see it when I was using but once I came out of it I understood how detrimental subs actually were to my sobriety.I edited it because you were technically correct. Again undermining his success was not my intention but since its convenient for you that’s what you like to think. He should he congratulated and celebrated i, like you, was correcting his wording. Specifically the word “sober” if you were having a hard time figuring that out.Okay. Well if your taking them orally I think there both exactly the same. I thought you were saying ones always stronger than otherlol edgy. You can be in denial all you want but there’s no such this as just having fun with heroin.  

She’s not a lady you flirt with, by the time you think about leaving her, she owns your house and slashed your tires.You are a fucking lame and are in for a rude awakening. Clown shoes.Not in suboxone!So anyone who takes painkillers after surgery is a junkie and not sober?Only if we were all just honest about the definition of sobriety the opioid crisis would resolve itself lol You must be a believer in Jesus who thinks condoms are evil
Lol, no....just no. Chances are I’m far more educated than you. You’re a troll and just all around shitty person. Beta-endorphins can be up to 33 times stronger than morphine. And release of that endorphin results in pain relief and euphoria/sense of well being. Isn’t that why we all starting using opiates in the first place? The only thing missing compared to an opiate high is depressed cardiovascular function, which some people seem to enjoy for some reason. Same receptors activated. Exact same. 

https://i.imgur.com/KiIENqd.jpgI understand that, but I’m talking specifics - what specifically did you notice about your mental state on subs and then off them? Or are you just against medication for some other reason I had fun with heroin for about 3 months said I could quit any time then WDs kicked in and I said to myself, is it really that bad being a junkie? Then I went to fix.\*I can't do it so nobody can

Is that the jist of what you're saying? I use bi-weekly and go cold for 2 months every 3 months. I've never ever failed at it. I don't need some moralising asshole coming here being like "Uh did you know that Heroin is bad?"

Nooooooooooooo?!!!! Shut the fuck up dudeStick to the tramadol then buddy>A fucking lame

Good one You’re right actually! Which I assume is rare for you. The buprenorphine itself is preventing overdosed because of its high binding affinity and the blockade produced by that singular feature....if you are under the influence of pain killers then yes, you are certainly not sober. Not a junkie either...if this is a troll then good job...I understand the feeling may be similar you dumbdumb but one is a synthetic opiate and the other isn’t an opiate or synthetic at allEveryone’s mental state it different. It is the same as on heroin and off heroin, two vastly different mental states. For me the biggest was a numbing and high feeling suboxone was causing that I didn’t even realize until I sobered up. The same is for meth and off meth, cocaine and off cocaine. Again it is different for everyone and no I am not against medication. Again if you want to take subs to feel “normal” by all means do it. I am just pointing out the fact that although you may feel normal you are not sober, that’s all.Yea that’s what’s gonna happen to him too. He’s in denial but I don’t blame him. Who wants to admit they’re a junkie? I sure as fuck didn’t.I used pain pills for recreation off and on for probably 10 years legit before it became a problem. But it did. And every single thing I said wouldn't ever happen, got checked off one by one. Never do heroin, that's for junkies! Check, I'll try it instead of pills, but I'll just snort jt, I will never shoot up, that's the point of no return. Check, I'll just do a shot every so often as a treat for when I'm on a binge and snorting stops working as well. That lasted all of a couple weeks. This ignorant motherfucker has me legit triggered, talking this bullshit like he's special and untouchable. This shit WILL grab your bitch ass sooner or later, Randall. But just keep right on thinking you are fucking special and have more discipline and self control than the rest of us, homey. You're gonna find out the hard way.Ugh, I really wish I could see you face to face. I'd beat the fucking smugness right out of you, and that's not some bullshit internet tough guy talk, I'd do it and make you like it, chump.thequotes.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mark-Twain-Quote-18.jpgWhy is it rare for me, cunt?I dont think you understand how narcotic replacement therapy works... Let this man feel good about being off a horrible drug. Maybe your'e just jealous you could never do the same?

&#x200B;You don't understand what sober means. You think because you got clean then you and you alone get to decide what sober is. Sober means not intoxicated, drunk, high. You can take painkillers and not be high.

I recommended you stop thinking you are better than other people because they don't fit into your own definition of something.This is pretty much exactly me. I mean we were snorting OCs on the weekend and going back to school all week, no fiending, no withdrawals. Eventually you just cross a line and before you realize it your an addict. Your in WD and pills are drying up, somebody hands you a baggie and tells you "It's literally the same thing." >Relevant in any way? No. Going cold every 3 months just proves I have a handle on it. I'm not aiming to stop, the aim is to maintain the ability to stop when I want to. Which I still can. Run along moraliserMy goal is to help him and anyone who thinks being on suboxone is the same as being sober. I will be 4 years clean of dope this November. I used to think being on suboxone was clean but it’s actually harder to come off because the withdrawals are worse. Like I said he should be happy he’s off of heroin for 30 days. All I am saying is that as long as he is on suboxone, he is not sober.That is correct sober means not intoxicated, drunk, or high. If you are taking pain killers you are intoxicated. If you are taking suboxone, again, you are intoxicated. Don’t think I’m better than anyone I’m just trying to help the guy out because someone explained this to me and I too was stubborn like you. But I’m glad they told me because it saved my life so I’m hoping to save someone’s also.My mistake. Keep using your nice safe occasional heroin. You definitely have it under control, that’s never backfired for anyone I’m sad.

You need to stop talking, you keep making it worseThen you're simply way too sensitive. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Always 5 minutes, Content: , ups: 736, downs: 0I'm pullin up im at the light Not mine. I always go to them and they’re always home (old people) never have had to wait thank god I laughed, out loud. 

It wasn’t quite a guffaw, nor a snortle. But more than a chuckle, for sure. Oh my god - this guy is killing me.  My regular got picked up and his son is filling in.  Take yesterday.  Texted him at 8:30am.  He answers about an hour later and says 1:00.  But he *always* says 1:00 and he has a fit if you bug him.  So I wait til 4:00 to hit him up again.  He forgot, sorry, he'll be around at 9:00.  Text him 9:15.  Sorry, traffic, omw.  Again at 10:30.  I got you, I:ll be there.  11:45.  You mind if I see you in the morning?  
And this shit is typical
I've spent more time sick in the last 2 months over this than in the previous 2 years with this kid.
His father was so great, I foolishly let all my other contacts slip away and now their numbers are no good.  
Fuck me.
This iss pretty funnyCome thru, omwDon’t come yet. It’s hot over here right now. I’ll call you in 10 minutes. Mines the worst. Im leaving now... 20 min....10 min....pulling up. When he says pulling up hes actually leaving. Ive waited 8 hours for the dude before. Sometimes it's "7 minutes" though. Like... c'mon, just say 5 or 10 cause we both know it's gonna be at least 20+ anyway.I'm pulling up....I'm pulling up, I see you right now....

Sure you do bud...30 mins later..I'm pullin up rnim on my way nowMine today "got them percs, pull up"
Pulled up
"sold out"
SMH 20 minutes Felt like me today. It literally took my guy 9 hours to come through. 9 FUCKING HOURS!!!!Oh my God! This truly is a universal thing! “1min away”....half hour later. “Dude where are ya?!?
“1min papi”I figured out my dboy’s way of telling time so I always tell him I’m at the spot 15-20 mins before I actually am. Saves me a lot of waiting around“Can you just meet me at this place 40 minutes away or you can just wait for me. I’ll be there in 20 minutes” -Chef- Houston TX. Man imagine not even having a plug at all and having to rely on fucking middles.. fucking sucks, not even worth using.. That's the rocket payload [Cliff's alien parasitic bed bugs](https://redd.it/93cch1) hitched ride on.Always and never �LOL omg this is so funny!Here I comeFigs-in-ahh pull up rnHang on i'll be there in a secIt'll be quite the wait once the lawd comes to take them to the convalescent home in the sky :(Yup old people are the best plug. Just gotta hope he leaves his pills for me in his willOh man, this is scarily similar to what I've dealt with.

I need a drug dealer again.  It has been so long.Yo this shit bothers me! Like, this is your job, homie. This is the only thing you're doing to make money. Why do you gotta keep me waiting and pull these lines out your ass. They're obviously all lies. Just be upfront about it. I wish i could say this to my one dude, because he is exactly like that and I totally feel you. It's so annoying to have to deal with. Especially when you don't feel good.Kids these days ;-)I'm sorry. I've been there too much. Those are some long fucking nights...and some sweaty mornings...I could not deal with that level of bullshit. Sorry you have to go through that.I fucking hate this line. I always used to get this copping in an open market. "Yo its hot just walk around the block a couple times and come back"...like thats not more drawlin? Thank god I got a plug where I pick up now and its never "hotc so no waitingI fucking hate this line. I always used to get this copping in an open market. "Yo its hot just walk around the block a couple times and come back"...like thats not more drawlin? Thank god I got a plug where I pick up now and its never "hotc so no waiting8 hours? Fuck that has to be some sort of record. Lmao the classic "I see you right now!" Oh yeah! That's funny cause I don't see your or anyone else and haven't for the 30 minutes I've fuckin been here!!!!!

I don't miss those dope boys, not at fuckin all. Gladly, they’ve passed me onto their suppliers since im a very nice trustworthy and cool person with them, not just “another customer” im a very well groomed presented young male compared to the junkies that come( no offence to anyone) that are disrespectful; sketchy and non trustworthy The boys in kenso love that line. I’d be like bro, it’s always hot wtf are you talking about?I agreeeeee. Im so grateful I can just call my dude and not have to go to the block. Ugh.It was fucking brutal. If i need to meet him at 8pm, lets say. I'll tell him 5pm, that way when I actually am at the spot at 8pm, i only have to wait 30 minutes or so. Dudes ridiculous, but he's got the goods...soo it's bittersweet.NoiceKindness goes a long wayI feel ya, i’m always wicked polite to my plugs. Their always kind of taken back at first because their so used to cudi’s being mad disrespectful, coming up short on bills and only telling them when they pull up, please and thank you and etc...it’s weird saying thank you to your dude lol but they always appreciate it. I get hooked up more often then not, they don’t play games with me like they do to other people. They give me “white man time” instead of “spanish time” (their words not mine)

Like i said at first, their always taken back by it because usually everyones always rude to them so they gotta be a dick back...
I’ve had one old connect who took my kindness as weakness and didn’t realize the type of weight in hold with a lot of people around town...they lost a bunch of customers and had a nice and kind ass whooping � 
But idk the way i was raised i can be beyond polite when it’s not needed but it doesn’t take away from how i hold myself...some people believe it makes them look “weak” by being polite and shit but it’s really notI agree. Thats how i am with my dudes, too. They respond better to someone who is loyal and trustworthy than some of these other assholes I see. Haha near Allegheny too my dude. The only day I'll hear that line and not be mad is Thursday cause thatxs when they get the choppers out and walk the blocks and shitI hated going to the badlands and kenzo. Where I'm at in the midwest now my dudes come to the decent side of town and although I've sometimes got to waiy an hour, I prefer it to hitting the streets. I suppose it's nice to know it's there though.Jesus where the hell do you live that that's acceptable?Thank you sir Yeah especially in the drug scene. You know when you think about you need to be able to trust someone in a place you can’t trust anyone. It really does. I was raised with morals honesty and respect. I wish I could find a S/O like myself. I did have a beautiful wonder girl for a month I crushed on for months. Sadly she went back to her ex or 3 years:/ I appreciate every second I had with her. The best sex everI once lost a  back up dope dealer to this very thing. He had me waiting for no joke like an hour saying 5 away. While I was waiting my main more reliable dealer hit me back. Sure enough they both call saying they pulling up within like a minute of each other. So I had to tell my back up dude I’m good went somewhere else. He gave me this bullshit speech about loyalty and how I can’t hit him up anymore. I told him to fuck off cuz every time I called him it was the same hour wait for shittier dope.

Couldn’t believe the guy who literally bullshitted me every time for an hour or more, while lying saying he was close had the nerve to cut me off and give me an ethics speech.Yea forreal kensington is not my thang. Thankfully ive only ever had to cop there a few times. I feel like its gotten so much worse than before.[removed]Ehh you sound a tad arrogant tbh. Out of curiosity, what do ya do for a living?You appreciate every moment you had, best sex ever? You know how that sounds? 

I had lunch with my ex-girlfriend yesterday. I was with her for three years and I’m ashamed to say I never deserved like I had her. Don’t get me wrong, she was my best friend, I made sure to show her that I loved her however I could. It was so fucking hilarious how giddy she would get when I’d get her flowers out of the blue. I mean I did it because it made me happy too see her happy so it wasn’t selfless. 

But I’m just glad that we decided we’d never be gone from each other’s lives completely. I mean there’s still so much between us, when you know someone like that it never goes away. I’ll always love her, but I also shouldn’t try or hold out hope we might get back together. I did a lot of lying and would use drugs to the point that I didn’t realize how much I hurt her. Fuck it still just kills me inside to know who I was. On the converse, she’s the most gracious and loving person I’ve ever met. She knows it kills me and was able to forgive me unconditionally. She’s a beautiful person. 

You know I don’t come to this sub to choke back tears but damn. [removed]I’m sorry if I come off that way. I work at the Family Business and invest on the side Damn bro ;( sounds like you two had a genuine love for each other. Man oh man do I know how that feels :/ . I also made my ex aware of how much I loved her and would also do out of the blue cute things just the little things count youknow:/ Specific locations aren't allowed  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Must be 🔥, Content: , ups: 737, downs: 0Maybe it's heroin

Maybe it's fentanyl

Maybe it's maybellineFucked up but so, so trueAbsolutelyYup done this many times.Trueeee ( 2 chains voice )must be fentanyl...at least these days it seemsWhen I ODed it's cause my shit had fentanyl in it, which immediately changed my outlook on this logic Can I ask why? I’ll purposely go through a different plug if I hear shit like this(assuming it's not fentanyl)Can't relate.

I don't want fentanyl.I had to save my friend’s life the other day because we smoked a batch of H mixed with fent. His lips were blue, I gave him CPR. Luckily I didn’t have to press very hard on his chest. His involuntary muscles must have been working just enough because I could pump on his chest and he would take these shallow quick breaths when I would rapidly press on his chest. I would give him mouth to mouth and when I did he would take a really deep breath afterwords. I did this for an hour until he came to. I almost called the ambulance until i noticed that pressing on his chest caused him to breath enough to turn his lips back to a normal color. Now I just have it hidden and we are not touching it for a LONG time if ever again. Shit was terrifying. Fuck that, fent has fucked up the h market.. if it was raw h, I could see it, but in the u.s., if people are dying off a batch that just hit the streets, it’s not raw, it’s fent, or carfent.  
How I wish we could stop this fucking drug war. legalize, regulate, and tax drugs(h in this case), OD’s would go down 90+%.  We would be able to get a consistent, quality product that would be so much safer.  I’m highly confident that I will never see common sense drug laws, but what a dream it would be. 
Still not running to cop some killer fent, unless I was detoxing and that was all I could get.  Yall can have my share!! Lol[deleted]People actually want to stuff that makes people OD. That means it’s really good dope and they don’t need as much “Damn buddy must have some fire”I got a pretty high tolerance tho, shit prolly won't have me noddin. Those pussies just can't handle their dopecomments make me feel like I have the unpopular opinion of specificly seeking out fent. ���I literally got told thos today, that people have been dying off this batch.  I've always had a high tolerance to opiates though, even before I started using.  A blessing and a curse.NaturallyWell to those who are suicidal, then regardless of what happens,
It's all worthwhile right? Not saying if you have you are suicidal, just a food for thought joke. 
It's crazy the shit we do that can be clearly seen as stupid regardless to whatever extent though our minds are still capable of rationalizing us through it.Seriously guys what do I have to do to go cop some fent in a new city?maybe it's diacetylmorphine. Maybe she's born with itif people die it means its really good dope. i want real good dope. terrible logic but it is what it isThe same reason why we are opiate addicts I the first place... Lack of humility. We think it's not gonna happen to us.Then you are the judgmental guy screaming thru the window in the cartoon.Bruh get narcan, please talk to tracey she will send it to you.So glad you got them back! Fuck fent! If you are going to keep fucking around, get a thing of narcan!! You probably should of just called 911 and hide your stash. I know it sucks but when a friends life is on the line it’s not worth risking it Yep! I support you 100%. It is unfortunate that this will likely not happen during our lifetime.Lmao @ leachers like Kevin. Gets me mad cuz I’m like dude you have $8 stop being a fiend for 2 seconds and save that to live onusually just means its fent lol Lol @ this comment.Nice try FBIYellowpages Light yourself on fire and go to erFent is not really good though. I never liked it. I’m from the Midwest and will shun a dealer selling fyou mean its fentNo judgement. I have thrown shit out before that’s fenty, that’s just me thoughIt’s ok we are NEVER doing that again and there is narcan at my dad’s house. I might get him some but i don’t think he will do it ever again after that. I wish I had it when that happened. He was so fucking lucky. Who's tracy?I wont ever do that again. I felt good but my buddy almost died. There is narcan at my dads house. I’m never doing it again its just sitting in a deep dark corner of my art room and its never getting used ever again.I know but as I pumped on his chest his lips turned back to a normal color and every pump would cause him to make a shallow breath. Even if I did call an ambulance I would have had to keep doing that or I'm sure he would have died. I almost called but I realized that I was giving him enough oxygene and after 45 min. He came to.Junkies love fent Hahha gottem For real, account was made a week ago. Definitely a narcSame. Don’t like fent currently, yes, it’s probably fent. 10 years ago, it was just good dope(:The mod of the this sub, the mother of all dope addicts, the supreme sober sultan, the harm reduction pariah, the god, the one and only tracey helton. She was the focus of the 93 HBO doc about herion addicts. She got clean, she got degrees, she got jobs and she has spent the last 20 years doing everything she can to help addicts with clean works, narcan, aid, resources, you name it. She wrote a book, she does talks, she fights for addicts everyday. Cool, this shit is not worth death! Eh it’s pretty 50/50. Fent can get even the most seasoned addicted high as fuck but it doesn’t last long. It’s a personal preference get high as fuck on fent or stay well all day on dope. 

Personally I fucking hating not being able to go more than 3-4 hours without a bump of fent dope I couldn’t even get a full nights rest without needing a 3am bump. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOsQv-rrEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOsQv-rrEE)May I ask what the comparison is like compared to oxycodone? How would you describe the experience?[deleted]I did freestyle this piano song when I got home and was still fucked up https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/awe7ok/free_style_on_my_antique_baby_grand_piano_from/

It starts out slow but gets coolerDedDepends on what analogue you get, but it's usually a very short but powerful high. Oxy is way better, lasts long , is nice and euphoric, itchy. The fent I've had was itchy, whacked me like a train, but I needed to do a shot every like 15 to 30 mins.   Not something I would recommend if money isnt an issue, just get the oxy. It's not worth playing with your life like that  Like others said fent doesn’t have as much euphoria. 

Also fent sucks when you got a habit and your just trying to stay well. When heroin in my area turned into fent I couldn’t even sleep a full 8 hours without needing to redose What the other commenter said, but when I got fent pressed oxys it hit me 10 times harder without the euphoria. I was nodding the hardest I ever have in my life in the middle of my college class and the fent I had lasted around 6-8 hrs and came in waves I thought it was done after 2-3 hrs but came back in full force for another 3. It's not worth it. I could died cause I didn't know I was taking fent till a week after I finished themEntirely lacking in euphoria. Will nod you the fuck out though. 1999 documentary! I’m not THAT old ��‍♀️�Tbh this deserves silver.. If only i had silver to give you Yes what OP says here. The first time I did it, I thought i was getting real blues but luckily when i broke them up i could tell they were fake. I did a literal crumb of it and was whacked out of my mind. I never nod on fent, in fact I cant sleep at all on it (same thing happens sometimes on oxy for me too), but the high with fent is so short, have to re dose and its just not that same euphoric buzz oxy gives. Plus oxy lasts a lot longer. It really isn’t worth itYou will learn nothing while nodding in class.Luckily I had silver to giveSpent all the silver on the plug lolYeah I know it sucked  I normally don't nod with regular oxys. Unless I take a lot at homeYou just made my damn day. And you didnt even give it to me. HappyDay4MoneySo if someone gave me silver can I give it or something? How does that work? Or do I have to buy it? I got it once.  I didn’t see anything change It's just cool flair really, not like gold which is like "premium reddit" with no ads. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: This has probably been posted but I laughed out loud when I just read this., Content: , ups: 726, downs: 0Junkie love is a powerful thing haha Virgin abstinence vs Chad heroin addict I always get a good laugh out of the incels “chad the junkie” lol I love how he thinks he's a good person while assuming an entire subreddit of addicts are shit people lmfaoLol we are very charming I'll give us that.It really do be like that sometimes Yeah but Chad the junkie has drugs and you probably don't Yeah, because OP is probably not introspective in the least. I have a former friend like this. He was single for a long time and complained to me, saying "I don't get it. I have a nice house, I make good money, why am I still single?" Well, maybe because he treats women like objects, is a pathological liar and probably a sociopath, and thinks that all you need to "deserve" a relationship is a nice house and money. Material things. It’s weird seeing people actually buy j to this mindset lmaoBruh this made me laugh way to fuckin hard. That dude done had his girl took by one of us hahahaIts bc you're ugly dude Hey. Everyone needs love, even junkies, (im included in this category) except people who deserve to be forever alone. Fuck them man. 
It’s not even that difficult, you can be ugly as fuck and still get love, but the people who don’t get others are those people with shit fucking personalities or they’re major fucking assholes. It’s pretty simple, be a fucking good person and don’t suck and someone will find you attractive.Ah getting more pussy than some sad mother fucker! Chad over here will fuck all your girls for you! Twenty a pop turn off the lights and bam yo girl thinks you gotta dick from outa space.r/niceguysMr steal yo girl There's no such thing as Chad the Junkie. Chad is YOUR ALLS BOY. Dope dick ftwWhat makes this even funnier is that this guy obviously doesnt know what dope dick is and if he did he'd be even angrier. Chad the junkie is stealing your girl even while having a dick that only works half the time LOL love it.TIL I‘m a chadBeing bad is more fun. Girls know this better than guysThat sub is just r/incels with a less racism Fucking incels, drive me nuts. Like whining about never getting laid is going to get you fucking laid.


Oh, and yeah, we are addicts so we cannot be capable of love or being loved. The stupidity of some people blows my mind.The reason they don't have a girlfriend is exactly that attitude. I have seen my most down and out friend out on dates with the most beautiful girls, sheerly because he is a nice, caring person (despite his drug issues). Incels do my head in � I'm dead. That's absolutely fucking awesome. I like how he said "the girls you have crushes on" because he probably never even tried talking to them lolThat's too fucking good. Incels and "Nice Guys ™" are envious of addicts. I mean how fucking twisted in your head do you have to be in order to blame addicts for your lack of ability to get laid, or get into a relationship. 

The thing is these people give off that hateful, weird ass vibe that sounds alarm bells when you first meet/talk to them. You know that feeling when you meet someone and can just tell that something is not quite right in their head. All that hate filled vitriol that they spew online comes bleeding thru their personality in real world conversations, and the little voice in the back of your mind says get away from this psycho and don't give them your phone number. HahaChad has a bigger penis!2 hour opiate infused sex sessions..Because that dope dick don’t quit. A lot of us are functioning successful junkies, for now at least haha God I hate people who think like this. I don't care WHO IS moving in on your crush. The world isn't unfair. You just suck. Huh ... I'm literally (or have) all the above.  Pretty long-term monogamous, though.This some incel shit right here.lol, damn them incelsSo who breaks it to him that his girl is a junkie too. She’s not cheating with chad the junkie for his engaging conversation and rock hard cock lolwe got mad drugs and money what do u expect i thought girls just wanna have funHey I’m a slightly overweight unattractive guy hanging on to disability - and I still have an amazingly hot wife. It’s cause I’m nice and pay attention to her and treat her like a queen. 

I laugh at so called incels. It’s all self inflicted. They realize that ... their life will change. Idk I don’t find myself as a junkie I have a car, a job and I use multiple drugs as safely as possible and I also do as much research as I can before I try something U/ChadTheJunkie officially taken.Go over to forever alone and see how many whiny bitches there are that think there’s no correlation between their relationship status and their attitude lmao In our defense 95% of the time we can come up about $40 in a moments notice. That could be a cheap dinner for two or night out!Lol maybe if they stopped whining about how lonely they were and went out theyd run into someone EVENTUALLY, how pathetic, for christs sake Im lonely but at least I dont loathe in it and let it get in the way of seeking a relationshipAha hahaha. .....

I'd def rather a junkie Chad than an incel.... 

but I got lucky, I got a good boi who still loves me even though I'm broken af....I actually knew chad the junkie lol. Rip. Ahahahahahahahahahah incels are jealous of dope habits? Geez man go be the plug and see how many bunnies you have at your feet What a nasty ass fucking post. Fuck that dude, I hope his hateful ass doesn’t get any until he fucking mellows out.I don’t understand his ideology, how is it wrong for chad the junkie to fuck your crushes? Bro if you have a crush on a girl just stick to that. If chad the junkie was fucking your wife or gf then yeah I’d be mad too but your crushes? That’s whack Having big salary, big house blah blah.  If that's the sort of talk you use to impress girls then no wonder m8.  Think of what you think of a bloke when he starts going yeah I got this and that and a big house.  Maybe Chad the junkie has a personality  and they see past the drugs The weirdest thing is I get alot more girls now that I’m deep into addiction than I did when I wasn’t using. alot of girls tell me I’m mysterious(which I am bcuz I’m hiding my usage) and then they wanna help/fix me when they actually get to know me and I usually force them out of my life or ghost them after awhile bcuz I know I can only go so far in a relationship in the state I’m in. It’s weird when u want something it can be so hard to get it. But when u could care less about it you can’t get rid of it.  The ladies love us   because  they've  never been with a guy who dosent nut in 35 seconds  before and once they meet us they're  as addicted to us as we are to drugs lmao XDu/ryaasu lolThat subreddit must be an incel circle jerk, maybe spend less time complaining about opiate users and more time interacting with other people and they wouldn't be so hopelessly pathetic.Chad prob got a bigger one then you bro Dope dick > What a fucking loser hahaha
just pathetic, but nothing new from r/foreveraloneWhy do these guys just not get it. What???? You mean junkies are still people that are capable of love??? I am a junkie and I have been with my girlfriend for 13 years. She’s way out of my league. She’s gorgeous and i look like an island boy with a drug problem. We have two beautiful children together, and although I battle with opiate addiction, they know that I will die trying to make sure that all three of them have the best life possible.incelSup bros, I heard someone was talkin' about me? Imma go set them motherfuckers straight. Fer sure.LOLi havent gotten laid since i stopped getting high everyday.

girls rushed to me when i was nodding out though.

ive been with dudes girls before, cucked a dude once even, he slept on the couch while i fucked her. Why are these r/incels picking on us?  Love how he throws in "be a good person" as if being an addict somehow equates to being a bad person.Don't let this asshole tarnish /r/ForeverAlone. 99% of people there are good hearted people who have a rough time finding friends/an SO. FAers know they're the reason they're alone and that subreddit is an awesome community. /r/Incels is the shitshow and that asshole belongs there.Should have woke up Janelmao belee dat I stayed fucking niggas bitches when I was getting high. Now that I'm sober- well some things never change :) Gosh. I’m sorry. There is no ivory tower here at all. I don’t understand you guys downing me. =[This is true though. Being an addict who is clean for quite some time now can agree that junkies tend to get some of the baddest bitches in the world! U know the the whole "girls love bad guys" well it is all about power and control. The girl chooses a hard case, felon, drug addict,etc and you're scratching your head like, WTF??! SO HERE IT IS BROKEN DOWN , WOMAN LIKE TO CONTROL AND EMPOWERED THEMSELVES, MUCH LIKE MEN BUT WITH THE FEMALE THEY THINK THIS "BAD BOY" THEY CHOOSE THEY CAN SOMEHOW HELP AND CHANGE THEM AND THAT ONCE THEY CAN DO THIS THEY HAVE THE GUY THE WAY THEY "WANT". Unbeknownst to said female, drug addicts only change when they wanna, girl or no girl. See drugs come before everything...sex,food,etc...so woman are powerless. P s. Sorry 4 all caps earlier**The Virgin** -

Pls someone make a real good one Chad the heroin addict, what are the odds. I love you so much for this comment Stuck in his box. If only there were some kind of eye-opening experience to resolve this kind of mindset...Haha.  I would pay money to see you try to explain this concept to him.   I guarantee he couldn't wrap his mind around it. Incels don't get how offputting their negativity is. You can be a rich, good looking dude, but if all you do is complain all the time no one is going to fuck you. Yeah and drug addiction is one indicator of anti social personality disorder. Even with superficial charm we do better than incels I guess..

Edit: anti social personality disorder is what I meant, damn phone...:)They don't think it be like it is but it do.You sound like a moron.Nailed it!

Literally tooI know someone like this as well--it is as if he expects a significant other to show up like his Amazon boxes do. No, dude, you have to seek someone out and develop a relationship. It takes time and work, and one is not just automatically 'issued' one because you have a good job and a house... It blows my mind that this would actually have to be explained to *anyone*I agree. And you know we slept at her place, ate her food and borrowed her money as long as she would let us get away with it. Lmao. Ugly on the inside, where it really matters. /femaleAnd test clean of Hep, HIV, etc.  Can confirm. Ugly as fuck and I still have love. And she's wayy out of my league. Why? I bathe in a thousand gallons of charisma a day.Ehhh, social anxiety can fuck with that.lmao /r/braincelsMr steal yo *anything*

Junkies..am I right?mista fuck yo bitchall these rappers talkin ab gettin head off lean U know they arent rly sippinIt definitely is more fun, depending on where you're from. Small, rural living conditions always result in more hard drug use in younger populations. That's why certain people gravitate towards those in that lifestyle. I mean, until they get knocked up and have two kids before graduating high school. At least that was the case in the small Ohio town I lived in for a while.It's crazy that there is someone envious of us. I've never had any problems in the female department but I have a fucking crippling addiction that controls my every waking moment and even haunts my dreams. I could go to a bar or get on tinder and find a chick to hook up with but the love of my life died of an overdose in bed next to me and since then I've been way less interested in relationships. Also I'm trying to stay clean for the first time in forever so most of my day is filled with the thought "I'd sure love to do a shot". I'm pretty fucking miserable and that's a step up from recently when I was entirely fucking miserable and these dudes are stupid enough to envy us bc we can hook up with females. Smh My dope dick would like a word with you, please.*knocks on wood*I mean the world is pretty unfair, to be fair. How else do you explain parts of Africa or the Middle East? Being born there is kinda unlucky and kinda unfair The world is super fucking unfairThe world definitely isn't fair, otherwise I could smoke weed in peace, without having to be considered a criminal. Also it's not fair how good opiates make me feel, and then with drawl, that shit sucks. So you’re Chad the Junkie *with* the 6-figure income, nice car, & big house?

Lucky you, able to weigh in with the likes of ppl on this sub!Howwww...? I feel like I'll stay single forever bc even tho I'm a reasonably attractive and employed girl with a stable income I just can't imagine a scenario in which a good guy would wanna spend any time with my dysfunctional dope slamming ass. Also I wouldn't wanna deceive anyone but bringing up addiction on the first date ain't it either. You're....not a junkie. You just sound like someone that parties. That's a good thing man. Dont do dope and you'll never have to be one.

If you're homeless and spend all morning dope sick flying a sign at a highway off ramp to score so you can get well...you're a junkie. Or pawn all your family heirlooms to buy dope. 

Or lie constantly to everyone that loves you. 

Or dont have any veins left in your arms that will register so you've resorted to shooting in more *creative* places.

I'm a junkie and it's not a good time...

That power only works if the 40$ is for dope though..They’re pathetic babies what do you expect? ...That doesn't work 60% of the time. *Sweet*. 

jesus christ I just browsed that forum and for however miserable they are they should've become one of us alreadyOmfg I died at "Chaddict" DaturaI technically am “involuntary celibate” but when you literally start calling yourself an Incel it’s game over, you’re never fucking You literally summed up their problem lol. I think people can tell on a subconscious level as well.[deleted]That's what I don't get about Elliot Rodger. Dude was relatively handsome and drove a BMW. Lived in Santa Barbara where there are tons of girls. If he just put the tiniest amount of effort in..
?? Anti personality disorder??And here come the wanna be edgy "socipaths". For real though, most addicts are just looking for an escape, however momentary it might be. [deleted]It's a meme brother.Nickelback sounding headassYeah well you sound like Nickelback.

JackassYeah well you sound like Nickelback.

Jerk.Exactly. I feel like we're talking about the same person. It scares me that this mindset is common place. Just because he's got a few things in his life in order he imagines a relationship to just show up--I love your Amazon analogy, that's perfect. Never mind that he treats women as sex objects and annoyances otherwise and takes great pleasure in weaving elaborate lies to make himself look good. 

I once was sat right next to him while we were smoking and watching TV. A girl he was dating texted him and asked him what he was doing later that night. He laughed and said "watch this." He read aloud his text to her as he typed it out -- he told her his grandmother had fallen ill and as much as he'd love to take this girl out as they'd apparently planned, he was his grandmother's favorite and needed to be by her side as she might not have long to live. He laughed and told me his grandmother was fine at home. 

And yet he wonders why he's unwed with zero actual prospects. It blows my mind. Woah! High standards much??? What’s it like looking down on the rest of us from your ivory tower? �nahhh share the love broHep really doesn't matter in that situation. I agree. I am OK, and things work out. And BPD makes that a little difficult alsoThis comment is gold lmao 

P.s. it's not real gold so nobody try and pawn it!! Hahaha �If I had gold I would give it to youHaha for real! 

"Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more"

Shut up Rick Ross how you fucking more by taking more opiates haha.These type of people are beyond help lol. They blame everything on either "slutty women" or the "mysterious Chad" instead of reflecting on the common denominator here which is themselves. 

I've noticed that they all have horrendous personalities which anyone they interact with notices, which results in them not getting laid, which results in them becoming more hateful. It's a vicious, hate filled cycle they stick themselves in. 

And they keep this cycle going because it's easier to bitch about and hate women and other men than to actually change how they think, and interact with people. 

With all that said I'm sorry to hear about your loved one passing away. And if you've already kicked the habit and got through detoxing you really need to keep fighting the urge to shoot up bro. I know I'm just some random message on the internet but if you ever need someone to talk to that can somewhat related to what your going through don't hesitate to hit me up at any time. 

I hope life goes well for you bro and at least one guy on Reddit is rooting for you. Have a good one!Take it from someone that grew up in a thirld world country, it's generally not as bad as most people are lead to believe by those infomercials play "in the arms of an angel" showing starving kids and rampent death. Don't get me wrong, great suffering exists, but day to day people are pretty much the same as anywhere else(barring cultural differences and whatnot). 


As a side-note, I've noticed that despite worse living conditions, people in poorer countries can lead a happy overall life hugely as a result of the community based cultures which are kind of natural product of economic poverty. People generally look after each other and their struggles bring them closer together. Still not something to envy, because the reality isn't that great in the end, but it's not all doom and gloom  :)[deleted]yea with drawl sucks- but have you ever been without drawl? For the next twenty minutes, anyway.  Or I'm a troll, whatever.Honestly, I think that if you’re authentic, painfully honest, and confident about your lifestyle you can find a good guy.  I just got into a new relationship 5 months or so ago and I told he guy right off the bat.  

I roughly said: ‘Hey, I’m a heroin addict who has been involved in all sorts of less than legal schemes.  I’m trying to get clean but I relapse sometimes.  It’s been quite the journey but it made me who I am and I don’t regret a second of it.  It’s allowed me to find strength in myself that I never knew I had.  Anyways, if that doesn’t scare you off, I’d like to take you out.  We can see where things go.  I promise you right here and now that I’ll never lie to you, you can decide later if you can do the same.  For now, I just want to take you on a long walk around my city & maybe grab a bite.  You in?’  

We’ve been together for 5+ months now.  I think things were made easier by the fact that I’m trying to stay sober, but I’ve done this in the past when I was still using & it still worked well.  My #1 rule is that I NEVER lie to my partner.  If for some reason I lie or manipulate them, I call them right back and explain why I lied and what part of what was said was a lie.  Most men I’ve been with didn’t believe that I was that honest with them until they heard me apologize for a small lie they didn’t realize I had slipped out.  Another big thing is that I try not to use directly in front of a guy until I know he can handle it - I go to the bathroom or something.  He knows what I’m doing, but unless he asked to see it, I’ll keep it out of view.  This also keeps me from being asked by someone who doesn’t use to try H which is so not my idea of ok.  I’ve introduced one friend to h and another to pills ages ago & I don’t want to go there again.

Anyways, good luck!  As long as you are open & honest, (about feelings as well as facts about your life), you’ll find someone who cares for you.  Ignore the username, I'm a male.  I made the username for a troll post.

But I'm gay -- I'm pretty familiar with men.  They might not want a complete junkie mess, but if your circumstances are such that you can keep in your shit together and not spend most days alternating between wasted and too sick to get out of bed, there are lots of (pretty successful) guys that won't mind you.  It's not the drug use that bothers anyone, it's all the associated antisocial behavior.  Can you control that?

I never hid the fact that I'm a junkie, not even close to 100% functional (I mean, I am pretty miserable a couple days a month and just kill time - like now - waiting .. ) and my partner's a doctor who doesn't touch anything stronger than weed or alcohol.  I never hid anything from him, we were friends for years first.  But I guess I made a pretty good effort all the time to not be a stereotype.  I think if he'd been further advanced in his career at the time and dealt with more junkies like he does all the time now, he might not have taken a chance on me, though.You just haven't met the right one, Im a good looking guy, have a good job, and all that as well. Hell I'll be honest and say I to am a "dysfunctional dope slamming" type of person and probably always will be. But that doesn't hold me back, I continue to push forward, try to find the positive in every thing that comes my way, work my ass off everyday, and mainly I put myself out there and I make sure I'm in a situation that I'm going to get the opportunity to meet new people, not just fellow "slammers" either. A person can never have too many friends so even if I don't find someone I'm interested in like that, I'm still walking away with a few new friends regardless. Just hold your head high and be proud of yourself, and trust me there's plenty of guys out there that would love to spend time with your "dysfunctional dope slamming ass", I assure you of that.So heres my thoughts on it- take it or leave it. I've been in several using relationships and also relationships with other addicts when we are both clean, and a single relationship with a "normy". 

I don't think anyone who is actively using is fit for a relationship in any sense because quite simply you don't have the capacity to fully care for another person. You have one need that must always be met and will always come first- no matter what. 

I don't think a good guy would be making a good decision in spending time with an actively using heroin addict to be honest- same with a girl getting with a guy who is using. They deserve better and hopefully they know it. When I was using I ONLY attracted unhealthy females.Meet guys who are in a similar position.

The somewhat painful truth is that if you are an addict and/or mentally ill etc, most "normal" people will probably not like that.

But the world is full of people who have their own problems and will be understanding towards yours, whether they're addicts themselves or have different issues of their own.

My ex's always broke up with me because once they got to know me they didn't like what they saw. But I've been with my current gf for years because she has her own issues and we understand each other and to an extent even help each other. That is key.

It's like I'm a broken person but she helps me feel more complete. You gotta find that.I guess I’m not a junkie then just a kid that likes to get high, sending prayers for u
-this message took me 5 minutes to write im too high of MCreative places? Example? Angel's trumpetUh...no? No poison.my biggest secret to them is this little trick I found online. No matter how desperate you are,theres always a fat chick more desperate willing to bang you. lower dem standards boiiizI was too for a while, and had to use all the strength I had to not let it affect me. Luckily
It worked out because I was able to mask it, but when people make that their identities it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. "I demand a 9/10 fit girlfriend, but I shouldn't be expected to get in shape or make myself more attractive or sociable at all".Please tell me what the f is an “Incel”!?Elliot Rodger said himself in his videos he was too scared to even talk to women. Apparently this means they're the ones at fault, not him. Makes no sense. And he was scripted Xanax too I dunno how you can be unable to chat to girls on Xanax I can't stop chatting up girls on benzos.Anti social personality disorder, they mean. Which doesn’t have to do with being introverted or shy, the way it’s usually used in casual conversation. It refers to being “anti society” and is characterized by lying, manipulation, superficial charm, and usually substance abuse and violence. Extreme cases of anti social personality disorder are often referred to as sociopathy or psychopathy but that doesn’t mean anyone with anti social traits is a sociopath. I was told I exhibited anti social traits when first getting sober/admitted to rehab but they usually tend to diminish with clean time.I think it falls close to a criminal psychopath in psychology. Anti personality disorder is essentially being a psychopath who doesnt commit crimes.Sorry I totally meant anti social personality disorder. It's the umbrella that sociopathy and narcissim fall under. One of the signs is substance abuse disorder. It's listed as a symptom in the DSM 5... Use the Google, not everyone is "trying to be edgy". Well don't be stingy, share the damn meme!We must look like ants from all the way up there.share the love, not the needleThank you. Metro church girl is not working out bruhYup... story of my life.Not to mention autism spectrum disorder...Lmao, thanks man. I'll take your junkie gold cos I know none of you broke mfs would pay for the real thing. 

....but..for real. You got any gold? My moms sick. And..I have kids.��Hey man, we all wish we had some gold. It's the thought that counts ;) thanks.[removed]Travel to a few poorer countries in Africa and talk to some locals to get a good idea of what their life is like. I'm not saying this in a condescending tone; I genuinely think that you would personally benefit from such an experience. The perspective you gain will expand your entire world view and maybe even shift the way in which you think in general. I have a hard time believing that someone whose username is XXhornykitty could be a troll Thanks, that's so obviously the right thing to do but so so hard... Time to stop complaining and start putting myself out there lol. Super glad you have a good relationship btw. Also, you sound like a pretty brave and honest person. Thanks fr. Maybe I don't trust people enough, but I'm afraid someone might not look beyond me being an addict. But I'm far from a mess. Self sustaining and if you didn't know you wouldn't guess I was using. Thanks for the reply, man. I guess I have to take the risk to get rejected and just start meeting people.


Edit: that didn't sound right. I sure am a mess in many ways but not an obvious one. That is the perfect way to put it. My partner has smoked weed like two times and is an awesome person but I never lied to them. Probably because I am too lazy to do all that. I would much rather be like hey drop me off here and drive around the block lol!

I think if we are honest and don’t make our habit a burden on everyone else, a lot more people will understand than we think.

That’s what hilarious about Mr. Incel...he can’t get that if you’re obsessed with your needs, your entitlement issues, and blame everything on everyone else, then people will figure out pretty quickly they can’t deal with you, regardless of your job or drugs or whatever.

It’s like they’re jealous because they are sociopaths without even superficial charm lol!

Edit:wordI was a kid that likes to get high too. We grow up to be junkies if we're not careful. That's all I'm saying.  Be safe famLol...weirdest was probably in my inner thigh uncomfortably close to my vag. Oh and..in the side of my fucking thumb...that was awful *but it worked.*.There's a fine line between death and deliriantTrue? When I was super junked out I turned down a lot of sex from chicks ranging from ok to fucking smoking hot bc all I cared about was getting high and I knew I wouldn't be able to get off even if I tried for like 12 hours. It would just frustrate me. The incels would reee so hard knowing that while they're crying themselves to sleep with their anime body pillows theres ppl casually turning down pussy for drugs.Honestly, if not being able to get laid consumes your entire life you clearly have bigger problems 

These people just blame women for not wanting to fuck 300 pound neckbeards[deleted]a sociopath is the word you're looking forNarcissistic personality disorder is a separate diagnosis from anti-social personality disorder. They share similar symptoms though.Yea, it's comorbid, but I'm preeeeettty sure that most addicts aren't pre-dominantley full blown sociopaths. Maybe an addict will behave like someone with ASPD while using, BUT that isn't necessarily an indicator of who they normally are.Might just be the withdrawals lmaoI wish I could give you gold for that commentI just need to put in work. That's all. Dunno why OC got so highly upvoted, there is just too many exceptions where it isn't even our fault.And they all are sick... cough cough Can you please edit the part about who you live with? This breaks our meetup rule. Lmk when you edit. dude it was not serious, but if it made me healthy i would move to any place in africa, trust me (yea, even somalia) i cannot even fucking work so i cannot buy nice things

maybe if you lived a day like me it would also give you a new perspective and if you are also ill then i am sorry, also deleted the comment because i dont want anyone to be upset about it, it was not seriousThe account was created for a troll post, for sure.  Which was quickly deleted, spoiling an hour's carefully-crafted hilarity (or so I thought).

I'm too lazy to make a new account for now.Yep.

Although on reflection I might have been a little too sanguine: I don't want to pretend that the knowledge that their loved one is an addict isn't a burden, even if you manage to keep your problems wholly to yourselves, which, admittedly, most aren't capable of.  My partner is very familiar with me (10+ years) and knows I'm not going to overdose or anything and once in a while he still has these despairing monologues about helping me quit, not knowing the magic words to say to help me, etc.  But aside from that, and aside from the occasions where maybe I've had to force myself to be pleasant company when I wanted to just lie in bed moaning, I've kept the chaos and ugliness away from my family.

My partner and I talk a lot, and I don't think we've so much as mentioned or hinted about drugs for weeks now -- so it's a pretty small issue in our life.  This is unlike the vast majority of addicts.  But if you've got a stable income + stable access + a long-term user with a regular dosing schedule who won't be tempted to blow the mortgage on a few extra shots, it's possible.  It's always good to have a methadone script for emergencies of course, or as a bit of a base.  I don't know if you've ever tried methadone, but contrary to what people might think, it binds to the same receptors as morphine but for a longer time and without  the same rush.  After the first 20 minutes it feels identical to heroin IMHO.

P.S.

People often describe sociopaths as having "superficial charm", but I dunno, to me they seem sleazy and transparent as fuck.  I've certainly met a lot of them and don't fall for it anymore, I've become immune to sob stories.  What I've noticed though is that if there's a guy and a girl hearing the sociopath's patter, the girl is way more likely to find it charming, and the guy will just think he's a creep.Thank you for your advice brother, hope everything is well for you :) ❤️This sounds... profound. It really do be like thatit do be like that sometimes doe Bruh it really do be like that. I always bust my nut tho. After years of injecting large amounts of heroin oxymorphone and having sex from 5pm til 945am the next day eventually you start to be able to get one out after about an hour 2 if your not really trying. Makes for one food fuck session tho. Nice and long both parties leave satisfied. When I introduced speed into the mix is when it got exciting for me again. I was the same turning down sex left and right I think I went almost a year without a single fuck at the height of my addiction. My girl almost left me because I just was to occupied getting high and it wasn't even all that pleasant. It made her feel unloved and really sad. She offered me 3 ways with her friends that were so fucking hot not to mention honegirls or coworkers who all wanted me back then. Od give anything to have that kinda pussy thrown ar me like that again at current time �I actually think a majority of them are scrawny kids with acne and no social skills, which are all “fixable” for the most part. Never thought I’d be discussing the incel problem on /r/opiates, but here we are.as someone who used to be fatso, this! obesity is disgustingAhhh, I see. Thank you, Champion. found Shanewhy thank youEdited. Sorry about that.I'm a sister ;) but no problem. I dont want to see someone make the same mistakes I did.It got to the point where if anyone wanted to chill with me they had to have dope or be willing to get me dope and ppl actually did it. Super sad and I feel bad about it. 

"Hey lobster my friend who was over yesterday said you're really hot and she wants to fuck you" -friend

"Does she have dope?"-me

"I'll tell her to get some."-friend

Word for word how an encounter went down earlier this year. Getting sober is making me look back and realize how fucked up I was.lol i found this the few times in life ive had gfs. Pussy only comes your way easily when it knows you cant accept it.Yessss remember that guy Elliot Rodger(sp)? He was an incel and  murdered some girls in cali and killed himself (i think that's what happened.) He has some videos on youtube blaming women for him being a virgin and how attractive and rich he was but "bafoons" were getting all the girls. He was scrawny and had acne lol. Facts.. at least now my sex life is daily and amazing. Still sad to think back on all the lost times my girl literally wanted to have nasty af 3 ways or just watch me skull fuck her amazing hot friends. Everyone was down but me apparently and everytime they would make attempts it just went right over my head. I would just be confused as fuck wondering why the 2 almost naked females way out if my league were pissed at me. Now I just get to look at em and basically beg for a second chance and I get told I'm not man enough. Ego deflated like no other... at least my girl is way too hot for me now that I'm not soley focused on my fix and hitting an actual vein. Fml Rodgers is a bad example — he was actually reasonably attractive. Unfortunately for him, he was also a fucking sociopathic creep. Contrary to what incels think, looks aren’t everything.Ptoof that it's not their looks. It's their creepy attitude. Very true.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Buying H in NYC for the First Time, a Retrospective [long as fuck], Content: I was ordering the dried pods of the poppy flower and dosing myself with the narcotic opiate tea made from these pods a couple of times every month -- in the last years of high school -- then college -- then the years following school when I was directionless and sad, bouncing from one city to another in search of something I could not name.  My Paypal history with my preferred pod vendor is the most accurate record of everywhere I've lived -- old apartments and zip codes -- cities and towns I've passed through quickly and forgotten.  I've tried almost every opiate under the sun, and   have never been physically addicted or gotten into trouble because of them.

Anyhow, if you are into pods, you know what happened to them.  My last order of pods, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and take a trip to NYC to buy heroin.  I bought a bus ticket online, and made arrangements to stay with a friend for a few days.  The ride is a couple of hours from where I live.  I wrote down the address of a needle exchange, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, but my timidity when it comes to asking the “right people”, my clean-cut appearance, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, it was still early afternoon.  My friend was working until later, so I decided to walk around Manhattan and see if any opportunities would present themselves.  The first person I came upon was begging for change at a street-light.  When the light went red, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously, if she knew “where the dope spot was at.”

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, that she's in a methadone program now.  She seemed suspicious. Methadone is a subject I'm interested in, and we got to talking.  We discussed the length of the methadone detox, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, even with her suspicions, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks, it was too much to resist.

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, a rocket ready to fire into space.  “Alright.  Let's go.”  I was tagging along beside her, trying to keep up.  We jay-walked.  We jay-walked again.  A car honked.  A hot-dog vendor yelled.  My heart was pounding at the prospect that I might have actually started the chain of events that would lead to having heroin in my pocket.  She checked every machine we passed by with a change-slot:  pay-phones, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, it seems, has a brand name.  The bags were about the size of postage stamps.  I quickly stuffed it in my pocket, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed, happy.

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, restaurants, and cafés.  I presented a clean-cut appearance and almost always patronized the business whose bathrooms I used to avoid suspicion.  I carried a cup emblazoned with the place's logo, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, Tracie asked me if I booted. I said yes, and she offered me a “clean spike.”  I remembered what “boot” means, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, even though I know I'm missing out on the “rush” that come with injecting heroin.  A tall black guy walks past us with ear-buds in.  She discreetly pointed at him and whispered “he raped me”.  “He knew I had two warrants out and so I couldn't call the cops.”  “That's fucked up” was all I could think to say.  “My program, if they see me doing any deals or anything, I'm totally fucked.”  She threw the two tiny wax paper bags, into a baseball cap that has suddenly materialized in her hands.  

In the bathroom, I would unzip my backpack and take out a literary journal I purchased before leaving, not realizing that I would be too high to read any of it.  On it, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, and toss it out.  I would take the straw and scrape off any heroin that might have inadvertently gotten stuck on the credit card during while I made the line, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal, just to make sure I got everything.  I would lick my finger and rub it on the back of the journal.  If I saw more than a little bit of powder, I would feel sad for wasting good heroin. I would taste my finger.  It always tasted great.

Before I came to New York, I had scoured the internet in search of Fun Parties and Events and anything that might be interesting.  A Food-Lovers Group was organizing a “guacamole tour” – there were shows and concerts.  I never did anything on the list, my afternoons and evenings all surrendered to a series of heavenly nods.  

The third and final time I saw Tracie, her girl wasn't picking up her phone.  We walked around to kill time, calling often and getting antsy.  We went to a Starbucks, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, we ran into one of her friends, a handsome boyish looking middle-eastern kid about my age.  He had a Sbarro bag with him, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, and that I should not worry.  He loops around a corner.  We follow him, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags, tucked between his thumb and index finger.  He walks away immediately.  I put them in my pocket.  We dart off.  “You owe me two” Tracie said.  I tell her I know.  I counted the five bags and put two in Tracie's outstretched hands.  

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, while she uses the women's.  I declined.  She asked “Am I going to see you again? I figured you got three this time, you know, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.
, ups: 727, downs: 0Thank you for writing this. You painted an excellent picture of yourself and Tracie. You created tremendous sympathy for her. You let the story unfold at an unrushed pace. There are natural emotions shown simply. Whether or not you meant it to be, the coffee is a fantastic allegory, as are the fingernails.

A long time ago I worked as a first reader, and later as an editor. If I saw this submitted as a short story, I would recommend it for publishing without hesitation. Find a publication, and submit it. They're not cheap, but pick up a Writer's Guide, or see if there's one at a library you can use.

This story is worth money. I suspect that you could write more that are worth money. If you're worried about it being traced to you personally, tell that to the publisher when you submit. They'll know what to do.

Remember to only submit to one publication at a time. Wait until you get a letter back before submitting to another. Don't let rejection letters get you down. Every good writer gets them. The only people who never get them are people who never submit.

Good luck.I love this story. You have skill in writing, please don't waste it. This story made me excited thinking about my past but also very nervous for your future.That was easy to read for looking so long. Good story.TIL :  there are still working pay phones in Manhattan*Heart Warming Tales of the Doper*


Edit: Also, your writing is very enjoyable to read. You should try to make some money with it, if you dont already.I always think it's funny when people say a post is long as fuck and it's like a paragraph.  But this one IS long as fuck!  Loved it though, you're a great writer.  Glad you accomplished your mission, but stay safe!This just got [depthhubted](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/w3pku/thatsweetembrace_buys_heroin_in_nyc/). Great writing. I hope you do something with those writing skills!The path starts wide, and narrows to razor wire.

You usually don't notice until you start to fall. 

Live your life the way you want to, but be aware of what choices you make. You sound so much like me that it's uncanny. I'm sure most people here can identify with your search, however, and how we all at one point or another, find ourselves in an unfamiliar place, and need to find a way to score.

Good on you for taking care of the people that took care of you, and man - I so know the feeling of scoring through shady characters. I, too, have that clean-cut appearance... so much so that I always get accused of being a cop. I hate that... almost as much as I despise cops.

Anyway, I enjoyed your story, and the others here are right - you do write very well, and I'd love to hear more of your tails, from your pen, through your eyes.

Stay safe brother! :)Beware the tale of redditor SpontaneousH.

Casual pot smoker with a family, a job, and happiness. 

He documented his downfall by telling reddit he would only do heroin once. How tragically wrong he was...

He became a habitual user and lost everything, his sanity packed up and left him too.

Don't fuck with this poison

At your discretion- http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ke63/i_did_heroin_yesterday_i_am_not_a_drug_user_and/Very well written, even if it was complete fiction, you had me glued to the screen. I agree, you have a talnet, dont let dope fuck you up like so many of us.yep...i did that for 5 yrs and it swallowed me whole....like a whale....

i lostSounds like the fangs are in deep. good read. If you ever write a novel, please come back and tell us. That's the most enjoyable piece of writing I've read in quite a while. Get help. Seriously, get help. You have a talent for writing, use it.Great story man. Makes me appreciate having like 10 dope connects in my phone, and a whole city full of others just a 15 minute drive away. I can't drive through the city for 10 minutes without having people bombarding my car with bags. I don't think there was ever a time in my 6 year heroin career that I haven't been able to cop. I'd go crazy if I had to go through all those hoops just to score, but if I had to I would do it without any hesitation.I have gotten some of the best heroin I ever did from a homeless dude in NYC. I live here and could never quite get the same quality again. I love the detail!  It's also good to know that I'm not the only shy, non-street guy out there in this particular world.  [deleted]10/10 would read againyou should write more about your experiencesYou can make money off writing dude. Good story. Nice read man.I wish there where more post like this. Great read and great writinggood shit!That was great, thank you for sharing! I love the fact she denied even knowing anyone and had bags on her. Ahhh, heroin addiction. This is SUCH a good story.  Your writing is awesome dude.Amazing story

Enjoy & take care of yourself ;)Junkie bukowski?How has your life been since that experience?
Have you settled down at all or are you still a drifter?
Do you regret this at all?Your writing reminds me of Augusten Burroughs. Specifically his book [Dry](http://www.amazon.com/Dry-Memoir-Augusten-Burroughs/dp/B006Z2UC5A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341542373&sr=1-1&keywords=Dry+Augusten+Burroughs).This is one of the most interesting stories I've read here. I've always wondered what it's like just to go for it, you know?Interesting. I wish my story of copping dope of the streets of Chicago was as heartwarming.As many people have said already, your writing style is fantastic. I even paged through your submitted history just to check if you had any other posts like this one, so I could read more of your stuff. I really hope I get to read something else by you one day, and I mean that. Don't go anywhere, my fellow redditor.Hey man, keep writing. That's good shit. Reminds me a bit of Stephen Elliot... my current favorite author. Nice writing... I forgot I was reading on Reddit. Good story.Isn't heroin one of the most dangerous drugs out there both in terms of addiction and the harm it causes?Your skill with writing is sharp. Consider a full novel, as I would buy it. This reminds me a bit of the tone and diction of The Catcher in the Rye.Great story. I know I'm late to the party on this post but I loved reading it some 120 days later.Your writing is great, but it's all about you and how you feel when you do or don't get high.

My brother died seven months ago from that stuff.  He was an enormously loving person, but hurt everyone he knew because of his habit.

Get help.  If not for yourself, for the ones who care about you.Really, is this the response reddit?  That this is a charming story and OP is quaint and adorable?  This is a sad story of drug abuse, not something to be commended. Yes, OP, thank you for sharing your story. It's valuable and gives an insight into your world. But, this is not something to applaud, people. Are we so fucked as a society that we look at this type of person and say yes, good on you, we support you?  May I am just ole but as eloquent as op is here, I can't endorse the behavior. Fun read, bro! I agree with the good writing skill. Many Redditors are good writers I've come to notice, definitely keeps your attention.

That's cool everything worked out so well for you, especially getting lucky the first try. I've found out over time as well that giving "bums" change opens up a lot of doors. Last time it happened for me, I was sitting on an arterial street underneath the expressway on the west side of Chicago, at a light. A guy with a cup walked up and down the row of cars, and when he got to me I threw a couple quarters in his cup. First words out of his mouth after that were, "y'all need them blows?"... wasn't looking at the time, so I declined. Have had similar situations pop up though many times. One of the added pluses of being in the city; whatever you want is never far away.wow, this was really great. at first i thought it was just a repost of the old poppy tea drinkers demise story... but this was far better. i really enjoyed reading this and it kind of shed a happy light on an otherwise dark subject.So is "Tracie" your friend or the homeless person?Such a great story. i too love opiates. but i limit myself on this so called "forbidden fruit". your story was awe inspiring. write a book about it man.A fine read. Thank you for sharing.
[deleted]What does it feel like? what did you do after you snorted it? I want to know more.How's your use nowadays? I used to use oxycodone, gave me massive headaches and no euphoria but I still got a mild addiction.

Was pretty annoying, I have an addictive personality so I use (well.. try) everything sparingly.That was an enjoyable read. Thanks!That sounds like a good time, serious. Superbly written, I really enjoyed your story :)I thoroughly enjoyed writing.

I won't get into the drugs subject - to each his own. I must, though, salute your writing skills. I really liked reading it.I got nervous just reading this. thank you for shining a light on this world for me.Chemical romanceThis is a great read. It also scared the shit out of me and reinforced my intent never ever to fuck with drugs.This was a fun story from someone who has been there! Having hair down to my ass was GREAT for copping dope but God forbid if the random Chicago pig saw me...instant stop and search! Its a double-edged sword...

Thanks for sharing your story!I'm glad you x-posted this. It was a great read.I love this.  I hope all is well for everyone in your travels including yourself![deleted]Your writing is average.TL;DRI really appreciate your feedback about my writing.  I worked on this story for a long time, and it's so nice to hear that it resonated for people.  I plan on taking your advice and submitting my writing for publication in the near future.  Again, thank you for your kindness and warm words.Thank you, kind sir or lady.[deleted]it really was and I have a worse attention span than anybody I've metThey are called urinals nowDo you mean [Confessions of a Dope Dealer](http://www.sheldonnorberg.com/book.html)?

Great read.Yea!  Can't say I didn't warn you though. :-)  I'll try to stay safe.Also came here from depthhub, fascinating read. Curious what sort of withdrawals you went through (if any) as someone who did h without actually injecting it.Awesome!You are a beautiful writer.  Thank you for your comments.That was touching. Thank you.Thank you.  I appreciate your kind words.  Having a clean cut look is definitely an asset when it comes to avoiding detection, but a major liability when trying to make a connection for H.Not all users become addicts.  But every user who uses risks addiction.  What I'm doing IS risky.  I appreciate your feedback.  Thank you.How do you know he became a habitual user? yeah i bet he will be the one guy dope leaves alone.

 i know there are supposedly "functioning addicts", but i have never met one and have. a sneaking suspicion that "functioning addicts" are only people who just started.

proof reading this made me want to say i am not attacking you, just pointing out what i think is a sad reality.

edit: i am bad at proofreadingI appreciate your kind words about my writing.Maybe you're the one that needs help. 10 connects?  I officially hate you. :-PThanks.  Yea, I felt out of place.  Good luck with retrieving your login info!Thanks!Thanks.This happened about a year ago.  I'm relatively settled for a dude in his mid-twenties.  I've been living in the same area for a couple of years.  I still use heroin seasonally and have zero regrets.Thanks, I'll check him out.Thanks for your kind words. Haha, no shit right?

Nothing romantic about waiting in your car off some sketchy sidestreet for "10 more minutes" as you see 3 cops roll past... Copping on the west side can be terribly frightening, but the results are usually WAY worth it!  :-)Thank you.Thanks, I'll check him out.Hey, thanks, that's very kind of you."In many ways heroin is as harmless as caffeine and it is definitely less harmful than alcohol. Heroin has garnered the reputation of the deadliest and most evil of drugs largely due to side-effects from the War on Drugs."

http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/feb/03/drugsandalcohol.drugsThat's very kind of you.  Thank you.Thanks! :-)I'm sorry for your loss.A fucked up society is indeed one in which people feel the need to either look down upon or endorse someone else's private endeavors.  
OP's not hurting anybody, so give it a rest, Judge.Thanks for your comment, I appreciate the feedback.[deleted]Yea, the first paragraph really does make it sound like that.  Have you ever read [this poppy drinkers demise story](http://www.alternet.org/drugs/21673/)?  I appreciate your kind words. Tracie was the homeless person.Thanks for your kind words.What about alcohol/coffee/weed?I like this description of the opiate high:

"Fifteen minutes after downing my first bowl of poppy-pod tea, I entered "Flanders Fields," from the John McCrae poem: Where the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row.

Death was a possibility, I knew.

Immediately, I felt redeemed. The raw reel of life became distant, pleasant. My head was an overstuffed pillow that could softly implode any minute, and it didn't matter. Nothing could. A pleasant pressure settled on the back of my neck. I was snacky. I wanted sweets. I felt the promise of a divine massage as the pressure spread through my shoulders and opened my ribs like wings. My thoughts slowed down until just about everything seemed to fold neatly inside everything else.

I became happily over-focused in the comfortable mud of abstraction and triumph; immortality bobbed around me like fat peaches in a hot tub."

It's been a while since this story took place, but to the best of my recollection, after I snorted heroin I walked around NYC, ate pizza, talked with random people, rode the subway, checked out Brooklyn, etc.  Nothing interesting or special.I'm a strictly seasonal user, venturing down to New York every three or four months.  I haven't used in about three months.  I plan to visit NYC again in September.

I like Oxycodone a lot, but don't come by it anymore.  Good luck to you sir.<3It was a great time.Thanks for your kind words.Thank you, I appreciate it.I'm glad you enjoyed it.Indeed.Is that where My Chemical Romance gets their name from? I know nothing about the band.Maybe it's for the best.  Thanks for your kind words.Thank you.Thank you, I appreciate your kind words.I would very much like to see your "how to cop in NYC" post.  Please send it my way or post it to /r/opiates -- I'm sure there'd be a lot of interest.  Thanks!!What do you mean? His grammar kind of sucks but I found his story telling prowess to be well above average. Only part that took me out of it was when he started to describe her Starbucks drink. That sounded forced and cliched. Thanks, I know.whats an example of excellent writing then?I purchased heroin in NYC.Seriously though, skill is nearly poetic. Keep it up, please.will you write a book please? i love reading about drug adventures. just don't make it like Requiem. that shit was too exaggerated. I've been able to "chip" on a seasonal basis for a while now.  I don't think about my drug use that much.  I have a lot on my plate right now: job, girlfriend, hobbies, traveling, etc.  In other words, I only have so many nerves to go around, so my worries about my future are more about regular, straight-laced stuff -- typical stuff that would bore you to tears.  Insufflating off-white powder heroin is a once-in-a-while treat, a vacation, and I intend to keep it that way.Well I've been clean for 2 years and I'm not too worried about ever going back to opiates, but yes I do worry about my future. There are a  lot of things I want to do in life that opiates have delayed.Ooh a squirrel!*Confessions of an Opium Eater* is infinitely more interesting, to me at least.didn't feel long though... yeah was a great storyYou should probably stop doing drugs.I've never experienced withdrawal.  You need to use every day for several days (more like a week, I hear) to get physical withdrawal symptoms.He did a bunch of follow ups, check his comment history. For example; http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ohdc/2_weeks_ago_i_tried_heroin_once_for_fun_and_made/2 weeks later: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ohdc/2_weeks_ago_i_tried_heroin_once_for_fun_and_made/

edit: oh, i had this tab open a long time, didn't see wacco's reply :)"functional addicts" probably don't go around advertising their habits.You have a talent man, I know people who have messed around with opiates, and they have addictive personalities too, 2 of them died before they reached thirty, one is sick but still alive, he's 37, do you take them just for the buzz or is it to help escape from something?may i ask why?

I'm pretty sure heroin users need more help then concerned redditors.I only really ever use 2 or 3 of them though. I've got one main connect that I see on the regular, and two backups. If for some reason those 3 don't answer (which almost never happens), then I will dip into the reserves. Connects come easy in North Jersey.Good ol' Independence blvd [deleted]Most of what I said was based on this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_(mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence).svgThank you.  Please just think about your family and friends.  And it's not just about how they would feel if they lost you, but it's what you're like to be around now.

My brother was extremely irritable and annoying to be around when he was in withdrawal and not getting high.  Then when he was getting high he kept to himself.  I almost don't know the potential of his personality for the past ten years of his life because the drugs kept him from us most of the time.

I appreciate your condolences, but I don't want anyone's sympathy.  I just don't want anyone to go through what our family went through.He abused her? She had the heroin when he met her. This is clearly a Thing that she does.His posts seem slightly suspect to me.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ke63/i_did_heroin_yesterday_i_am_not_a_drug_user_and/) in the original AMA from 2 years ago he says he just tried H for the first time.  Then [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mhys7/i_used_a_methadone_clinic_for_15_years_to_quit/) 7 months ago he claims to now be 4 years clean after using a methadone clinic for 1.5 years. If he tried it for the first time 2 years ago I don't know how he could be 4 and a half years clean.

[deleted]Uhhh, I think those are a little bit different.Nice... maybe i've met you somewhere, and then as all new yorkers do, forget everything about the people they met five minutes before.Get help for fucks sakeNo idea. I thought it sounded cool. I'm not familiar with the band either, only by name.Oh it's probably above-average, but not really remarkable.  Some parts of it are good, others are kind of bad.  He tells a good story though.  The circle-jerking, "Oh my gerd you got da talents!" Pisses me off.  If he had told a normal story but one that didn't involve using heroin, far fewer people would have been patting him on the back.  It's a patronizing, "Don't waste your life, you have talent" thing.Thanks, your kind words are appreciated.That's very kind of you to ask.  I'm glad you enjoyed my writing.ASS TO ASShttp://www.vice.com/read/amphe-nothing-is-wrong-if-it-feels-goodYou're commenting on a month old post about someone who has a short attention span. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I found the incongruity funny.I can't help but hear that in al pacinos voice from dog day afternoon. I'll see your confessions and raise you one Diary of a Drug Fiend.  
So so good. [deleted]You should probably stop being a cunt.Fair enough; as someone who'se done a fair few different drugs, and never experienced any sort of withdrawals, been curious for a while about what, if anything, I'd possibly go through after trying H without actually injecting.I'm sorry to hear about your friends.  I don't have an addictive personality and am able to "chip" on a seasonal basis.  A "chipper" is a non-addicted user. [By some estimates](http://www.heroinhelper.com/user/misc/chipper_tips.shtml), these heroin "chippers" outnumber addicts 5-1.

I take opiates because they make me feel wonderful. Some people like alcohol, some people like sky-diving,  I like long distance biking, web-development, watching HBO's Girls with my girlfriend, and occasionally insufflating dope.  Perhaps forbidden fruit is the tastiest kind there is?

Glad you enjoyed my writing. So I take it you don't use?You'll always be the superior one. No matter what compelling argument we make you will never change your perspective on Opiates until you or a close friend delves deep into the abyss that many, like you, have such a vivid imagination about but have never actually seen.

Quite unfortunate, really. It's terrible when one thinks they are the enlightened ones and the open-mined being, when in-fact you are far from it. We all think so highly of ourselves, don't we? 

I suggest you just don't answer something you don't understand, kid. Hehe, my "spot" was traditionally around Cicero and Chicago! Used to get wikkistix off Independence though! These days there are good spots in Oak Pk so no more worrying about the insane Chicago five-oh! :-)Thanks for the background information.  "assuming it is clean in a regulated legal market" is a pretty big assumption. I know that using heroin (even occasionally) is risky business.  I believe your comments spring from a genuine concern about what'll happen to me.  Thank you.They say that you can tell a junkie is lying by looking at his mouth: if the lips are moving and air seems to be coming out, he is.Fair enough, you're a special person that every group needs.>  I've never done drugs,

Talking about drugs, what is different? Not the socio/economics factor.Thank you for your concern.Nah, it's actually quite good. Did you have a piece get rejected or something? I can see where you're coming from in regards to the responses being patronising, but it's a shame you decided to just come into this thread and post a worthless and rude comment like 'Your writing is average.'

People love to be critics. I see it constantly whenever there's a video or post relating to someone obviously talented. Someone will feel the need to chip in with "Oh, actually he was kind of flat" even if the singer is one of the best in the world and the performance was near-perfect. What I never see though is a well put together examination of the performance. Can you give a detailed explanation of the faults in his writing ability? I'm guessing you can't be bothered to give anything approaching constructive criticism, which is also a shame.My point exactly. And no vomiting in the clam chowder! Or amputations!! Thats my only request. It was almost too good. At a certain point I wanted to stop reading because I was so into it that I was afraid I might end up doing ~~heroine~~ heroin. [removed]You're not going to experience withdrawal if you decide to experiment once.  It takes a while.  But there are still risks -- legal, physical, and psychological.  I'd recommenced checking out [HeroinHelper.com](http://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/) and [Erowid.org](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin.shtml) for more information.That's funny, the first thing I thought of when you said opiate teas was Girls. 

I breezed through your post despite having an abysmal attention span, by the way. Take care of yourself. >So I take it you don't use?  

you got "bestof"'d so there'll be a lot of those coming in nowI just want to point out that you skipped everything on your to-do list in order to do heroin.  I'd say you have an addictive personality, even if you don't have a chemical addiction to heroin.>I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.

But you're insisting you don't have an addictive personality. This is a massive red flag right here. Please, please don't do Heroin again, if you were seriously missing Opiates and went looking for Heroin you aren't the "Chipper" you believe you are.That's interesting that "chippers" outnumber addicts 5-1. I really had no idea. I've met two people that have done heroin. One of them was an addict for several years but she's been clean since I've known her which is about 5 years or so. And my other friend does heroin once a year. It's like his christmas present to himself basically. 

It's interesting because they both have very different opinions on the stuff. The girl swears up and down it's the worst thing she ever did. My the guy absolutely loves it. 

I've no desire to try it myself but I found your story fascinating, and as others have said, your writing it thoroughly enjoyable! I hope one day you endeavor to write a book about your life. I bet it would be an interesting tale. 

Take care sir. Take what ferrarisnowday and F1A said to heart, and don't try to pawn off your addiction as a clever term, chipper. Even your username relates to opiates. All it takes is an unbalance of your life to throw you two steps above Tracie situation, or a full-blown unwelcome window washer. I have an addictive personality. But have been around two friends who claimed they didn't. Possible. But their life was a tightrope walk between "normality" and falling into the abyss. Don't play the game. You may like the wonderful high, but you also like the risk. I don't mean to chastise you. I went through an addiction on the opposite end of the spectrum and would hate to see someone with smooth writing talent lose it over the fleeting feeling of wonderful. Great read.   One question:  Do you not see how quickly you might become Tracie in this story?   Doesn't everyone start this stuff thinking they handle it, her included?

You yourself abdicated your entire planned agenda, and spent your time in NY chasing the high, or in toilets getting it.  Now you appear to be rationalizing it after the fact (don't have an addictive personality, chipper, etc.).   I understand this is why you went to NY, but the insidious nature of opiate addiction starts with these seemingly little decisions.

Be careful, man.  It's a slippery slope you are on.    Good luck.[deleted][But heroin's a gateway drug!](http://i.imgur.com/l5Yfu.png)Just because the word Chipper exists, it doesn't mean you are one. You're a regular user who went to NYC to do heroin. You're a full on addict. Great story though! Found it on /r/depthhub. Learnt a new word, am insufflating bitches tonight !I've seen heroin addiction, I'm not quite as naive as you think. I know it's not a black and white issue, but you don't need to be a genuis to say to yourself ''This probably won't end well for me.''

I suggest you just don't get into debates with someone about the advantages of opiates on the internet, kid.Yeah, I originally planned on heading to Cicero (I headed to Chicago from Wisconsin specifically to cop) but I was approached as soon as I got off the Eisenhower so I stuck around Independence ;) People are dying out there because the government refuses to regulate drugs.[deleted]He could be refering to hard drugs, even weed. Caffiene is as good of a drug as children's aspirin and alchohol is fine in moderation. No, I'm not a writer.Look man I'm just trying to lash out angrily, stop using thoughts.Only heroes do heroines. [deleted]I felt so ridiculous for Girls being the first place my head went. Glad I wasn't the only one :D Thanks, you too brother.How come? I've been watching the show, but was there any reference to opiates in it?I think the fact that he's done heroin more than once without becoming a serious addict pretty much proves that he doesn't have an addictive personality. Is he capable of becoming an addict? Almost certainly yes, but that doesn't mean he's got an addictive personality. Those people are all extremely impulsive by nature.Thanks for your feedback.GeminiLife, I really appreciate your kind words.  Thanks for your feedback.  It was interesting to hear about your friends' different perspectives.I appreciate your comments.  I love "the fleeting feeling of wonderful." 2scoops, I appreciate your concern, probing questions, and feedback about my writing.

I don't disagree with you about anything.  Tracie did think that she could handle it, just like I think that I can handle it.  What I'm doing is not safe.  Fucking with heroin is risky business, any way you cut it.I'm looking forward to trying Opana some day.  Thanks for your kind words about my story.Thanks for your feedback.Interesting! So I assume that there isn't much of a scene in Milwaukee? I'm not surprised.Exactly.  I totally agree with you.  I think that most of the dangers associated with heroin stem from its prohibition.  Addiction, overdose, disease transmission, etc. would be reduced if it were legal.  Portugal is an interesting case study.

From Wikipedia:

"In 2001, Portugal became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession. In addition, drug users were to be targeted with therapy rather than prison sentences. Research commissioned by the Cato Institute and led by Glenn Greenwald found that in the five years after the start of decriminalisation, illegal drug use by teenagers had declined, the rate of HIV infections among drug users had dropped, deaths related to heroin and similar drugs had been cut by more than half, and the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction had doubled."Almost everything is fine in moderation.. Compaing caffeine's addictive and health hazard qualities to other "hard drugs" it's worse for your health.
I'd link a graph but I cbf
I don't want the discussion to go this way.

Your thinking of the drugs from a social standpoint, I'm thinking of them from a logic/health hazard standpoint.
Based of this: >  is as good of a drug as children's

Touché.I think it was the first episode, where somebody makes opiate tea and the main character gets really high and then goes to her parents' hotel to beg for money, passes out. Well, if you go in clearly appreciating the risks, good luck to you, my man.   

I must say that I can't recall a single story that went " I started taking heroin...", and ended with "...and things turned out great!".   The opposite case seems abundantly prevalent, however.  

I'd strongly suggest you to get out while you still can, but you already know that.... :)

Please accept my final comment in the spirit it is intended.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that your wisdom catches up with your obvious talent.  
   [deleted]Haha good to see you not lose your temper at these ignorant beings.


There is, it's just not an open air market like Chicago [deleted]I dunno, I've just never seen any facts on heroin being good for you.Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks!Thank you for your kind words.  But please be aware that you're not going to hear about the untold thousands of successful unaddicted heroin users, not because they're such rare birds (in fact, we constitute the majority of users) -- but because the successful casual user is going to go to great lengths to conceal their use due to draconian sentencing guidelines for drug possession and archaic social stigmas.Yea, I look forward to trying some Opana if I can find some.  Maybe after my next trip to New York I'll do another retrospective.  Thanks again for the feedback.Interesting, always wanted know that!I wish I had more than 1 upvote to give you, sir.Lol dude Bayer used to sell the stuff in bottles around 1902 to cure all sorts of aliments. Me either(and I never said it was).

"good" and "bad" are not words which should be used often when talking about intake. (through food/medicine/vitamins/drugs, anything). They simply are too bland, and often don't describe the full effects.

Amen. "Eight varieties of Epipactis helleborine in central Europe (Lower Silesia, Poland) had their nectar studied and they were found to contain naturally occurring oxycodone (as well as another narcotic-like opioid) in minute amounts."When people ask if I believe in God, yeah, this one.Well meme'd my friendLike Frank Gallagher said in Shameless: "somebody should gave a nobel prize to the inventor of oxycodone" 

And damn, it's so fucking true! �I'm so glad to be an atheist In all honesty, I’d rather hydromorphone or oxymorphone. Satan created Tylenol Real shit Satan is happy about fentanylThey need to check the soil, its possible those plants were watered with municipal sewage water etc.

There was a stunning story a couple years back about the discovery of naturally occurring tramadol in an African tree, further investigation showed it was from human urine the tree took up and the source was really pharmaceutical.I'd like to know more.Oxy*morphone. There's Both the codeine and the morphine variant.And then decided to put them in opiates to ruin themFuckin rightThat's wha I'm talk'n bouu[deleted]I thought tram was completely synthetic?  That's like saying there's a tree out there with plastic leaves.I believe in god - crack, not heroin lol.And Mac Miller /:It is, thats why it was even a story that they tested leaves from this tree and found tramadol. Like a said a followup showed it was not naturally occurring and was from rancher pee that had taken pills.I think this was related to the o-DesMethylTramadol in Kratom thing, Krypton or whatever it was called.
Methamphetamlne and Diacetylmorphine(Heroin) can both theoretically under the right conditions form in natureMac was cocaine laced with fent.Ooohhh.  That's some crazyshitI dont think anyone laces coke with fent. If I bought coke that made me sleepy like fent I would probably not buy from that guy again at least without testing it first.i think there might be some cross contamination where a trace amount might get in but putting fent in coke is a great way to lose customers quick.It's honestly more likely he got xan pressies that contained fent and took one for some landing gear after his yipp.  I know there are rare cases of coke being cut w/ fent, but I just doubt that's the case here.  But Wtf do I or anyone know?Fent is laced in everything. A trace amount is all it takes to kill you if you don't have an opioid tolerance. Very powerful stuff. please don't make harmful assumptions like this. I know it's hard to believe but this is a problem that's killed many, including two people I'd met.

the article is from 2016 too, it ain't new @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Me watching this sub having no idea how to get hold of any drugs., Content: , ups: 714, downs: 0just boof some kratom, my bois honestly my life would have been so different if I never did drugs. I have been in 13 treatment centers if you don’t include outpatient or five day detoxes.  Twice in the nuthouse one was 45 days on a 302 involuntarily commitment the other was a 9 month partial hospitalization where I just went home to sled. On three suboxone programs currently in my third methadone clinic. Twice in jail, lots of good friends have passed away especially the last few years with fentynal. The true story of where it can take you is a lot different, and I know and knew some of the biggest guys and they end up in jail multiple times or disappeared all together. Literally had a friend get busted yesterday, her second but she will go for years. All that said I love the escape, the warm feeling you get, the excitement of just copping some good stuff even before you use it. But it’s insane to think the game is like it is on TV  or a movie it’s not. I had an awesome family that no longer has anything to do with me because of my in ability to stay clean . I have parents that are still married never drank or used and a brother two years older than me who has ONLY tried alcohol, I thank God he still is in my life and my best friend. I don’t know, nothing in me feels like people who haven’t done drugs are missing out on anything. I used to really believe that shit, but trust me the reality is far different... be careful out thereGoogle is your friend, Onions work tooYou can get all the benzos,  stims,  psychedelics,  and my favorite fent on the clearnet for dirt cheap from long term well vetted trusted vendors.  

If you want the real shit go to an open market like milwaukee, baltimore, Jersey, etc and score some dope for 5-10 bucks a point or some coke.  

Tianeptine is basically legal oxycodone and u can get that on ebay.  Phenibut is legal lyrica/baclofen you can get on nootropic websites...you just arent tryin hard, or at ALL. No excuse nowadays. I don't think it's ever been this easy.Lmfao same tho Ohhmygoshh, this is brilliant. I feel the same way. I have to go 3 hrs to pick up then 3 back, so right now this is me trying to seek out closer to my home cuz I dont have time before work. Ugh. Yeah this is how I feel when it seems everybody in here, *but me,* has re-upped their scripts and I'm on the verge of or in WD. It's a crazy thing! �

But I love my Opi family here. This is one of the only places I don't receive judgement. This thread has delivered... � � � Make someHow your guitar pick looks at you when you drop it in your guitarGet my free monthly refill of perks and morphine tomorrow. Can't wait !In most cases, in the end, its the other way around.

Yeah, seems right, all the dope fiends holed up inside their houses shooting up while longing for a semblance of normality and wondering how people can actually enjoy doing stuff when not smacked up. Best thing I did was quit drugs (especially H) two weeks ago. Now I want to kill myself for completely different reasons, but at least I feel less alienated.

Really, it might seem fun at first, but there's nothing to envy. If you like altered mind states, stick to weed and psychedelics (is what I wish someone had told me earlier, although they probably did and I paid no attention).

Also, there can be functional addicts, as is the case with most drugs, but it is a big risk to take. I thought I had everything going fine for me, but when the last person who tolerated you left you out of fear and lack of love, you realize you don't even need to be lying in a gutter and shooting up with used needles to be in the shit, although that does help. In any case, you can always sink lower, that is a really easy thing to do on opiates (and on most drugs, I suppose).[removed]This picture is a bad description of drug use lol. But seriously , you do not want to do drugs , shit will only bring bad things.Be glad you don’t have access unless you want to need ppl like the guy who made the first commentYou gotta dream about a web that goes deepSame but its intentional. You do not want to be sitting on this sub, missing the feeling of an opiate rush so much it makes you sweat. Getting a catch in your chest when you think about how hitting a crack pipe after all this time would be earth shattering. You don't want the aftermath. Trust. A year later and I still don't feel back to normal...this IS normal now. No confidence, constant fear, anxiety...opiates made me functional before they didn't anymore. Drugs are so awesome they fucking suck.Not worth it.Tbh when I was younger I could get anything I wanted and I thought that was cool. Now aside from cold copping I can't get anything hard and I deff prefer it that way. Maybe Patrick and SpongeBob od tomo and you'll be inside thinking damn glad I didn't go hang out with them. Eh do what you gotta do man. I know what that feels like. I for one am happy I didn’t make any life changing decisions when I was in the dumps though. Because I would’ve regretted it nowLol this post is the most popular ive seen in a minuteThat’s a good thing?I promise that you don’t want to get a hold of these. Super wish I wasn’t able to get a hold of them in the first place What you mean If they would legalize ranch already, this wouldn't be an issue. [removed]Best comment on this thread. I just boofed my morning kratom/coffee/tobacco cocktail. Added in some vape juice to help lube up my boof hole.Nipping is where it's at, just rub that shit all over your nips. There's no coming back from a nipping addiction. You'll be screaming into old men's assholes in no time. It's a nightmare.Nah bro, ketamine. Everyones sleeping on ketamine...aha, another fan of adam!Is this sourcing? ��Good way to catch a caserc’s bro....cmonIdk man, living in an extremely rural town in the US (my graduating class had like 60 ppl in it) hours away from a major city, not owning a computer, not having any friends that are fellow junkies, & not learning how to use the darknet before reddit & other sources made it hard to talk about on their sites has made it pretty tough for me :/ 

I would kill to find a darknet coach, but I need to stop being poor so I can get a computer first. 

Btw sorry if this comment was poorly written, it's 7 am where I live & I haven't slept yet, so I'm pretty out of it.Are the darknet markets still going? Used to buy back in the days of SR but not in a living situation where I can order to home right now. Haven't heard anything of the markets since the dnm subs were banned.The dopes expensive as shit though. fr. im sober now and cant walk thru downtown (not even that big of a city) with out getting ppl offering me dope and coke. not to mention messages on my phone. shit is too easy frI'm a chronic patient with PKD, extremely close to suicide due to medication denial and this comment is fucking enraging. I haven't been able to obtain shit for over 4 years because I can't leave the house. I don't know anybody. I can't go anywhere. My health is fucked to near death because of pain medication denial and also now anxiety medication denial. What the fuck do I do to not die because every fucking constant attempt and every doctor I can reach in or anywhere near Boulder has failed me and left me for dead. And after that, when the only path left to help was a lawsuit, nobody would help me eitner. So, Seriously if I can't get anything to change I'm dead very soon. I don't know how to fucking encrypt shit. The idea of trying to figure shit out just makes me want to jump off my fucking building. But so does everything. I can barely function enough to put a half coherent comment together. Fml. I've got nothing left to give when it comes to functioning - I've been. legally disabled for nearly a decade now - but at least being unable to eat normally or have fun means spare cash...

Eta [TONS OF PEOPLE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/9i0ieb/the_current_us_pain_crisis_caused_by_opioid) are in this position and pain suicide numbers are increasing constantly. Mostly in the disabled and elderly who don't know how to use the regular internet let alone the fucking dark web. Being disabled and abandoned by doctors is extremely normal in the US and one in ten suicides is now a result of unmanaged chronic pain. Honestly I can't wait to join them. It's been a long time since I couldn't take it anymore.

Eta. I've always used meds responsibly. I've never been addicted to anything and I don't know what withdrawals feel like beyond hearing other people's stories. They took my meds away for no reason but opioid hysteria. I feel you I have a 3 hour round trip and it sucks!Hey just wanted to say that your 2 weeks is awesome! Even though you still feel shitty keep in mind although your psychical body may be out of the woods, it takes a little longer for the brain to normalize. So it will get better! Hope the best for you man keep it upOoooooo look at you, cool guy!! �� congrats man, i think this is your best comment around here.  its *useful* as a warning to not do dope, AND as a reminder not to type like an idiot!  ������This has to be a copypasta I feel like people here constantly wrongly assume someone’s a brand new sprint chicken on the opiate cruise when it’s probably not true the majority of the time. You don’t know anything about OP besides the fact that he can’t get drugs right now for whatever reason. Maybe he’s been in the game longer than you, you have no idea.


.

And what’s this thinly veiled bragging your disguising as “advice” like your passing on the knowledge to some brand new fresh out of the fridge motherfucker. I feel like someone who’s been in the game isn’t going to be holding opioid addiction like some kind of trophy. Like what you’re doing now

.

Lame as fuck.I, for one, find you hilarious and would like to see more comments. Keep up the good work! GAnGgangThis douche bag again. If you so busy trapping why tf you on here. Foh wat r u doing in this communityGuaranteed a white boy 16 or younger on his moms computer in the back room of their double wide, lmao your history is about acting like a thug on this sub and lookin up how to build gaming computers lmao get a life kid☝️Dude i ive stumbling across your comments lately.  Why are you so fucking lit. some foos after you ? then clean house and gtfo. La area would take you in with open arms just chill out and stop talking so unnecessarily assertive..we've  all have gone through hell and high water here just like you.  I'm sure many will vouch on that, just chill bro.  Have a nice day geeI think it's only partially wrong. It's sad to be hopelessly hooked. Addiction is ugly. Sometimes it's hell. All that is true, but the image depiction is also partially accurate. When we have our drugs at hand, well, it's fucking awesome. i think it just depends on who you are and why you use drugs. like my favorite drugs are dissociatives and i abused dxm in the past, but i'm over that now and even though i have a ready supply, i only use every few weeks/months. opiates make me nauseous and are fun and all, but i could never get addicted to them because i just don't like them enough to want to be high often. on the other hand, i have adhd and stimulants make me feel content in the same way opiates can be a 'magic pill' for tons of people that makes everything feel right, and me having access to meth would be very dangerous because i know i wouldn't have any kind of self control. i'm tired as fuck but i guess what i'm trying to say is drugs can be used recreationally or as tools in a healthy enough way just the same as they can fuck up your life. know thyself niggahttps://youtu.be/Uh7l8dx-h8MYou don't want to be sitting here reading and sobbing in uncontrollable rage because everyone seems able to get it except for you who instead gets to be in constant untreated searing climbing the walls and slashing your arms just for distraction

#**pain**

because of a permanent kidney disease and universal doctor refusal to medicate it. I will ban you. No  sourcing Don't forget turmeric to potentiate. That's the boof you'll never forgetEat some curcuma �Nah,brah. Sleeping on DMT is far more erfective. 
how the fuck do u get ket though, half the city is addicted to painkillers but literally nobody knows what ketamine isKetamine been my doc since I quit dope two years ago. 

Tolerance is weird tho it seems to be permanent. I take a few months break and still need the same amount. It’s not uncommon for me to do 1/4 gram in one go and still not come close to holing. I typically can effortlessly go threw an 8 ball in a weekend. No, it's not. No it's the krusty krabWell, so is driving to score from a dealer, to be fair. RCs are 100% legal in the US,  except bk edpb and etizolam are banned in a couple states. 

Ive bought RCs and steroids on and off for 10 years in the mail and never once got in trouble. And only ever lost one package which was refunded. Customs just takes your package that is all,  police do not get involved unless your quantity borders on trafficking size.  So dont buy a kilo of fent or a kilo of 2flurodesketamine and youre fine.  Its almost impossible to catch a case bro, esp buying from china.  Ive been in the RC a LONG time and have only seen 3 or 4 people ever get busted and that was when they were found all fucked up off the drugs by their local police. Fuck dude dn ant that hard I'll try and pm you some shit man. Just don't go too crazy lol

And yeah same I live in small ass town too and it is rough, no doubt. In my life I have only have come across like half dozen people who'll sell some decent shit. Even then I have to deal with bs prices[here you go](http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=dark+net+how+to)not owning a computer? nigga youre on the internet right nowDN is mega easy, people moved to dread after the subreddits got banned.Still going strongI got stuff sent a few times to a very tiny village in the south east of Finland; it took nine days to get there from the UK (I was starting to give up by the ninth morning I spent continuously shovelling snow by the postbox), but when it arrived, I thought:

"Humanity, we've finally done it. We've trascended. Far off are the days when you couldn't get gear sent to the middle of fucking nowhere right by shittons of square miles of forest and lake".Where the hell? Medical neglect of the disabled is so bad where I am, I'm considering moving If you are in that much pain I would give the darknet a shot. It is not as complicated as it sounds. Find the right info and you will be on your way in no time.Have you tried kratom?

[removed]omg can we please make it one?please tell me how they are "holding opioid addiction like it's some kind of trophy"

Well, by the title ("having no idea how to get hold of any drugs") it does seem like OP doesn't usually have much contact with drugs. Also "watching" makes them seem more detached, but especially the "any drugs" bit. It makes me think of someone saying they can't get "illegal drugs". Maybe I am overthinking it, but the title does send off a drug-naïve vibe.Yeah but when we’re high on drugs its a false reality that everything is great , the reality of it is that we’re slowing killing ourself & shit is not great but hey I’m no one to talk I’m a heavy user & I get what your saying i guess I’m just looking at it a different way ya knowI have never, ever taken prescription drugs. You have my deepest sympathy for people ruining it for everyone else with legitimate need. I truly am sorryI’ve actually heard this but never tried it. What’s the best way to take it? Just add the turmeric to my jar with the kratom and water? Turmeric is curcumaI want sour patch kids and whataburger taquitos. I'll stick with the horse tranquilizer lol.Depends where you live man, it's big here in the uk. I don't live in a big city but i have 2 guys i can get it off.What RC opioid are you talking about? Because all the ones worth a damn have been banned.You giving out dn tips? Can I hazCan I get a pm too bro? Hey thanks so much! :DLmao!!! I use my cell phone. I heard you're not supposed to use your cell phone to access the darknet. I don't know why, I don't know much about this stuff. I'm also pretty retarded when it comes to technology.

I just woke up & this cracked me up lmao thanks for the laugh!Thanks so much for the tip!! Seriously appreciate it :) I'm so fucking tired of being sick like 2 weeks a monthGood to know, thanks man.You are Finnish or just visiting ?  I would live to visit Finland.   Great quality of life there [removed]as in u cant get prescribed pills? im in 407Sir this is a Burger King I'm 90% sure this is an awful attempt at trollingDude you’re on an opiates subreddit bragging about being a dealer (which is the first indicator that you’re NOT a dealer), and you’re talking shit about people that use opiates. Oh and somewhere in there, you’re talking about fucking someone’s bitch. 

Seriously, get a life. Or try harder to get the 9-5 that you really “wanna work”.  You sound lazy and ignorant, and you have no right to put anyone else down. Plus, you use way too many fucking emojis. Why can't you work a 9-5? Is it because you're mentally handicapped and can barely spell? Why cant you work a 9-5?What do you mean you can't work a 9-5? Motherfucker get your lazy ass out of here and go get a job like the rest of us. Ease up on the '100' emojis while you're at it. Makes you look like a fuckin' teenager. What a clown. This reads like a rap trackverified esports pro?? thought this trap shit wasnt no game"ain't nothing cool" �Unless u wanna be homeless begging niggas like me for a bag and we make you steal a car radio stay out the dope game �� shit ain’t pretty I eat breath and wake up to this shit my phone jumping every minute �� I have customers coming from out of town to buy my dope niggas my shit FIRE knock yo ass out boy real trap shit u don’t wanna need this shit cause one day ima fuck your bitch be sleep so I don’t pick up and u gonna be sick You're right tho. It's kinda sad. Opioids changed my brain *so much*, that they are almost everything to me. For real, they're everything. If I don't have them, everything is pure hell. But if I have them, man, it's wonderful. I don't even need to be high from 140mg of oxy 24 hours every day as I would like to. 20mg just to be well and feeling slightly nice is enough for killing my depression and anxiety.

I don't really care if it's a false reality (I don't actually agree with the concept of false reality in a way), I love the way they make me feel. They take alway all my pain and give me a peace nothing else gives me, so I'm against depicting addiction in a complete negative way. If there were only negative aspects, there wouldn't be so much addicts I guess. But as I said, you're still right in a way. Addiction is ugly in a broad sense. And most times it's not worth it.So here's my way:
1. Drink some grapefruit juice roughly 2 hours before 
2. You gotta have an empty stomach
3. Consume the kratom with some lemon-juice and optianally some peper
4. The curcuma can be consumed anytime after the kratom beginns to hit, but preferably after "the peak"
5. Drink some coffe, this will potentiate the kratom euphoria immensly but will remove the sedative effect a bit
6. Eat something fatty or better; just drink butter-coffee
7. Enjoy your maximum kratom buzz but the nausea will rize, too It’s true. He called me to bring over a bag of ice. I thought he was going to ice his ass after the Tabasco ass but Dude boofed the entire bag of ice��‍♂️ I been telling him to change his name from ResistingNut to BoofingGangstaBro I hate that they stop serving breakfast at 11am.

I liked snow too, emphasis on the /-ed/ past suffix; my feelings towards it waned a little after the hundredth day of shovelling snow, but it's true you can't beat the old sauna and rolling in the snow routine (although it feels really dangerous when you're drunk).

For the other thing, I'll send you a PM.We can't share vendor or market info here. 772You got me lmao lolThis is the most underrated post of my  entire 27 year existence. Ohmygod hahahaha ��no this is Patrick 100%. 28 karma, and not to mention his name is VerifiedEsportsPro..I hope so.

I think it's all great till its not....and when it's not you're in a living hell real fast.I fucking love butter coffee!! I’ll give this a shot tomorrow when I take my dose! Thanks mate! It should also be mentioned that this is not a means of tolerance reversal or reduction. It will still count toward your tolerance and probably be worse for it than just taking it normally. ��� if I could upvote this more I would. I was in line the other day for breakfast and got up there to the register to order my food, all pumped to get down and dirty nasty on some taquitos, order my food and get hit with, “oh sorry sir we stopped serving breakfast one minute ago.” Get on the dark web man, there are good subreddits for figuring out how to be safe ordering stuff. It's well worth it imo.Annnddd I have yet to find ANY positive information on the 3 you listed.

I love mushrooms, especially the ones that make me 1337Can you remove the cities? [removed]He done a goofHaha agree with the chris hansen shit but where tf was the racism in that post? chris hansen WOOP WOOP� Because this isn't sarcasm. If he's making this character up then it's satire maybe, but definitely not sarcasm. I think he's just a jackass, like youImagine breaking into a car and you see all this stuff like someone's left their bag with money and phone etc. in it but your eyes move straight to the radio like "aww yeah man this'll get me at least a couple stamps"People in 90's movies/rap videosDoesnt matter when you have a steady lifetime supply for free from the methadone clinic like me and millioms of others. I get the equivalent of 300mg of oxy every single day and i love it.  I dont do ANY other drugs i don't even smoke weed.  All i need is my opies.  My tolerance is so fast they by the time i dose im in WD so i always feel good when i dose in the morning. 

I was on suboxone for 4 years and it did the same job for me for the entire time i was on it. Why was butter coffee already a thing The only tolerance reversal is time and sport Are you kidding me? One minute? That's bullshit. I used to work at McDonald's (a long time ago) and we would always sell whatever we had left from breakfast. I couldn't imagine telling a customer that lol.Yeah and they’ll tell you that shit at like 10:50. Drives me nuts lol i'd love to but my living situation doesn't really allow for that. it doesn't really matter though, i'm probably a lot better off without access to unlimited drugsIve tried all three, so has everyone else in my groups discord and wickr friends and we alll love them.  Super potent,  euphoric,  and 20 hour half lives.  Ive seen the posts you are talking about and sounds like those ppl got hit with bunk product by shit vendors. I hope people dont touch them,  less press means less chance of them cracking down further in china. Okay guys I really want to help all of you, honestly have no problem. Ive already been pming 3 different people adivce �. Please Google darknet Bible and do some reading, because there is a lot. Once you have read that just pm me any questions that you have. I feel like this is the best way for me to help you guys, rather than assuming that you guys know nothing and having to compose a giant message explaining things that so in debth and have already been covered in the Bible. The Bible would also do a lot better job explaining things than I will. But yeah pm me anything you are still confused on and I'll do my best to help. Again I'm not an expert. �Hey man I read my response to /r/theoneofem below and pm any questions you have I'll be more than happy to help youYou cannot mention that here.

Car got broken into, they left his wallet but took his radar detector. He had one of those fancy valentine or whatever radar detector. His wallet had $150 in cash but nope, they wanted the radar detector Yeah...that's a different thing though.  Butter coffee is great Man. I drink it once in a while. I used to drink it everyday with Keto. nmda antagonists. idk how to get memantine prescribed but after some ket or dxm there's a noticeable decrease in stimulant and opiate tolerance. look up 'nmda opiate tolerance' and you'll find tons of research on it. i've also heard of gabapentin and magnesium having an effect on opiod tolerance but i know nothing about thatAgmatine.They do all day breakfast now, anyway. Yeah i stay away from it for the same reasons.What about a P.O. box?Telling a dude who can’t even find drugs, who probably has no tolerance, to start fucking with fent analogs and 3mmf is extremely irresponsible man. This is how people die. Just adding on to your comment r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs is a great place for anyone trying to get started. Do your research on both markets and vendors!! Always use 2FA and manual encryption.Cities in general aren't allowed, even if you don't live there at the moment. People who do live there might start talking about it, or it might tell people where to go to get drugs if they *do* end up visiting.

**********FAIL*********[removed][deleted]Its opioids,  taken everyday,  from a doctor . It gets me high everyday taken as Rxd.  I hardly see a difference.  Opioids are opioids. Addiction is addiction. Use agmatine. Its more than just a nmda antagonist too, its a wonder supplement.When did i *EVER* reccomend he use fentanyl? I said stims,  benzos, and opioids are all available on the clearnet,  which they are. I never said go buy fentanyl analogues and bang them up man! I just listed whats available,  as if everyone didnt already know fent is available. Someone who is not OP asked which opioids,  so i listed them.  I NEVER once suggest anyone use them and if you read my last post i encouraged people NOT to use them.  Whats with reddit and putting words into peoples mouths?Sorry, won't make that mistake again.lmaoooooo. so good, so bad.

I'm not your buddy, friend.You took the bait  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Lol shots fired, Content: , ups: 706, downs: 0Smoking weed doesn't make me want to do heroin. Sobriety does that all by itself.Not doing heroin makes me want to do heroin. I hate everyone.LmaoWeed makes me wanna use opiates cause it just gives me a sense of impending doom these days and I am craving relief.what about the ex junkies who *are* stoners?If I can’t do drugs you’re all losers for doing them.This hurt my soul lmaooActually no, I'll pass on that bowl. Don't want to fall in another psychosis and make my anxiety disorder strike me with double power.Used for 11 years flat out junkie for 6 of them. Got my medical card and smoke every day, haven’t used dope more than 4 times in the past almost 3 years nowVirgin weed ... chad heroin 

Fuck weed .. it just makes my anxiety worseWhenever I smoke. I feel super content with the level I'm at, and don't need anything elseBoof the weed! Fuck it, boof the dope too!!!See it's the opposite for me! If I smoke then I don't think about using.hahahaha ToucheOofAlmost everyone who does heroin for a substantial length of time eventually finds them self not enjoying weed at all it makes them to anxious and paranoid.

The only heroin users I know who like to smoke are ones who have continued to smoke weed throughout their heroin use.

But the way it goes for most is that all their time/money/everything becomes about heroin. Then one day they smile a bowl and end up having a panic attack.

As a long time heroin user the head change I get from smoking a bowl makes weed feel like a way stronger drug than heroin. The high from heroin in subtle and relaxing/a feeling of contentment/carefreeness. What in the end makes heroin a Stronger drug is its ability to cause dependence and withdrawal.

This may not be true during the initial stages of opiate use where the effects feel more profound but it is definitely true with long term addicts. There have been plenty of posts on here about it and heroin users who used to love weed/smoke all day everyday can no longer stand the stuff.

So I don’t agree with the meme at all.Weed is for kidsAfter doing dope why on earth would anyone wanna do weed? Iol. Keep it. Heroin solved all the problems I never knew I had. Till it rendered me poor and homeless. 32 months clean now but literally wouldn’t smoke weed if u paid me. Once you’ve seen the promised land there’s no going backAfter opioids, which I don't even use anymore, weed became worthless to meI’m still on opiates and I don’t like weed anyway. Will be trying CBD oil soon though to see if it’ll help with cravings and beyond that withdrawal. But no thanks to THCIf anything not smoking weed does that for meFactsI remember when weed would make me feel so happy and content with life no matter what was going on. I still used all sorts of other drugs to at the same time. Then at one point weed stopped having that affect. Now when I smoke its rarely enjoyable. Sometimes I'll get high with my brother n laugh and have a good time for a bit, but even then it's short-lived. Most the time I just overthink shit thats going on in my life or beat myself up over shit I did in the past, and makes me anxious and have zero confidence. So I end up feeling depressed/guilty/anxious usually over shit that never bothered me normally or shit from the past that didn't matter anymore. Sucks man I loved weed but now it affects me all weird n shit most the time.Ouch that hit the feelersThis translates to “I had a horrible time doing the drug you are doing and I took it because I was unhappy to the point of mental illness so I equate needing drugs to blocking out pain.”Ex-junkies bash on stoners because stoners are fuckin' obnoxious.

**Shut the fuck up**, do real drugs.

It's also so strange how some stoners can make weed into a huge part of their lifestyle or identity (weed shirts, weed tattoos, weed magazines, bob marley posters, all those kind of "look at me I smoke weed" accessories) and no one even bats an eye, but if you tell someone you took a couple vicodin before work they'll treat you like you're a total piece of shit junkie.  Honestly I've met full-on heroin addicts who don't talk about their drugs as often as average stonerfags do.Weed really is lame thoweed culture is awful. Unless marijuana is your income i roll my eyes when someone over 20 is "into" weed. It's like the default "interest" for losers no personality the same way being "into" craft beer is for people who don't do drugs. I smoke weed everyday but you wouldn't catch me dead wearing a weed shirt or shit like that.[deleted]Or if they are on parole, and this is so untrue its offensive....and not a lot offends me other then smelly PussyIf anything weed makes me not want to use. “sobriety does that all by itself” - couldn’t have said it better myself lmaoAmen to that !!  Lol100%  


time + sobriety + lonilnes = back or hair ronWow a guilded comment. You don’t see many of those around here.i feel the exact same way. weed used to chill me out and make me laugh a few years back. now it just gives me mad anxiety and makes me generally uncomfortable. i’ve tried to explain this every time to my friends and coworkers every time they ask me why i don’t want to smoke weed.Same. I wouldn’t smoke weed if they paid me how much it costs.yeah thats what im sayin, i smoke weed every day basically. it definitely does *not* make me want to bang dope again lolYeah srsly I hate that other people can just take a few norcos one weekend and not start looking for heroin on Monday.Makes me feel like the odd man out.
Shit is "natural", legal, and I can't take 2 tokes without fucking feeling insane.

I can kill a horse with the amount of coke or junk I can tolerate, but not 2 fucking tokes.Yep.What were the circumstances of those 4 times? How did you not fall back into routine abuse each time? And congratulations manWaaaaaay worse. I used to black out and everything!What you’re saying is true...but people who are clean, then think smoking will be fine cause they just want to get high and not go back to dope. Then we’re fucking sucks and isn’t even close to as good as heroin then you get the fuck its and want to go use dope. I think you think this meme is that they WANT to smoke weed. It’s not that, it’s that if we smoke weed, it sucks and will instantly go to banging dope cause we want to get actually high.Congratulations on 32 months. Big achievement. Keep it up.Yo, just a heads up- it doesn’t help with cravings or withdrawal for most people I know, including myself. It’s legal where I live and I tried that shit for awhile before I could get into a methadone program, and uh... nope.BANG THAT SHIT PUSSSSSSSYI see you’re getting downvotes but I wanna say, I agree with you 100% about stoners being obnoxious af. Now here come my downvotes lol.I don’t think anyone that also didn’t consider drug use as a part of their identity would be so mad at another person for doing the same thing. Stoners can be drug addicts too—just as obsessive and neurotic about their DoC as any junkie. You really ought to have more compassion for people who are also essentially sufferingwell shit, tell us how u rly feel lolI don't agree with the do real drugs part. When I was a stoner, (I never acted like what you described I was pretty down low about it) I was honestly extremely dependent on weed. It's obviously different, in my experience anyway, from opiate addiction but I think that you and many stoners as well don't get me wrong, are not correct in saying that weed is "not a real drug" and especially when people say that it's "not addictive". I was spending a couple of hundred dollars a week on bud for a long, long time. I would actually get some physical withdrawals, obviously nothing like opiates, but the psychological craving for weed was extremely powerful. I tried to quit countless times and failed. I fucked up a lot of relationships because I was constantly high from sun up, to sundown. Not even an exaggeration. I know a lot of people around here will laugh at me when I say this but marijuana ruined my life just as much as opiates did. (I never got into h though, didn't have access.) I do kind of agree with you about stoner culture though. I don't think that your average daily marijuana smoker actually acts like that but I know the types of people you are talking about and they are fucking obnoxious.I think it’s because when most addicts reach the point of addiction they realize this shit ain’t cool. 

I remember a time when I thought getting faded on some Vicodin while I’m in school made me kinda badass. It’s only once addiction slaps you in the face (or you just grow up) that you realize your an idiot for thinking your cool. Weed never hits that point so you never make that realizationThats weird. You had to have some idea on your own that weed is nothing like heroin. Obviously you never heard of people overdosing and dying from weed.So which is it, the back or the hair Ron?I’m torn on whether it’s an ex junkie who had extra money laying around or if it’s a current junkie with bad impulse controli’ve read a ton of comments in this sub i’ve wanted to give gold to but simply couldn’t afford itGilded! 
Also, have some of my poor man's gold�For real man. I loved weed all day every day until i got hooked on dope. Now weed just makes me paranoid and anxious af.There’s a theory that reality and introspection can be too much to handle all at once. If that’s something you’re prone to, consider getting a trip sitter to help you process and keep safe.I smole weed daily, but still want to bang dope daily but probably because im like 6 and a half months dope free so cravings are there. I don't act on the cravings but they're there regardless if I smoke or notI just straight up replaced dope with bud. Its pretty much the same crutch, instead of doing a lil dope and smoking a cig i smoke a bowl and then the cig. Like four or five times a day. Its obviously not the same but its better than nothing and its way cheaper, i can actually pay rent and survive.This..used to be me. i miss those days :(Same honestly. Always bugged me people freaked out when I was putting oxy in my nose, and they just refused to believe that weed makes me go bonkerz.I’m literally the same! I used to smoke weed but then it made me paranoid and anxious so I stopped. Never smoking again anytime soonBro this is fucking me. I was happy with bud. Used to have that anxiety relief waiting for me as soon as i exhaled the smoke. Was so nice and relaxing and now i cant even toke on a one hitter without feeling like im gonna have a panic attack. Thats why i quit.Raise your tolerence mate. Try out high CBD flower!Lol just smoke more weed. I’m at the point to where I barely even feel dabs. Lowkey sad. I never really liked the high from weed that much from the start though ngl.I just had enough man, I realized after knocking my head against the wall For years, that it was always gonna end the same way. Those 4 times were either from stress for 3 of them and one was for almost no reason at all. I just work 72 hours a week and it helps to keep me sober. Cannabis helps me rationalize my feelings and gives me a buffer to take a step back and think before reacting. I never really had money to smoke when I was buying dope so maybe I don’t associate them as strongly.If I smoked weed I would be all paranoid about something stupid having at work like some idiot hitting me with a fork truck and having to take a drug test. 

I can snort a fat opana line before work and fucking have a great day playing girls front line and Shit posting all dayI’ve got other stuff that CBD can help with like mental health, social anxiety and sleep problems. I am prescribed codeine for chronic pain but take way more than I should and it’s not a viable option to keep it up so I’m interested to see if the addiction will be easier to kick if I was properly medicated for my mental health and found an alternative for pain relief.

Edit: I don’t want to resort to methadone for a problem that is more of an inconvenience than a problem at this point.Bunch of stoners getting butt hurt because they feel like I’m attacking their whole identity. You guys need to hit a bong and chill out maaaan.Lol they’re not suffering as much as addicts in this sub. Those “types” are totally insufferable people that will never change or know what it’s like to reach highs above their heads.> Stoners can be drug addicts too—just as obsessive and neurotic about their DoC as any junkie.

I agree with this 100%, but I think the weird thing is that everyone else treats it like it's no big deal because it's "just weed."  Obviously yes, heroin is worse for you than weed, but I just think it's funny how you can take a total stoner guy who has made weed a huge part of their identity and is obsessed with it and everyone just goes "lol he's just a stoner" but you take someone who pops a few pills occasionally and people go "AHHH!! A JUNKIE!!!"Yeah man, I mean it’s like anything else. People who say that you CANT get addicted to weed are dumb. People get addicted to shopping, eating, porn, and drugs. Just because there’s no physical dependence with weed doesn’t mean it’s not addictive. I know plenty of stoners who would throw an absolute fit if they couldn’t smoke for a couple days.Marijuana didn't ruin your life, nor did opiates. You did that yourself. Just as when people recover and say that it was all god or some shit, nope. It was you and how you utilized your environment, not your environment utilizing youIt's not that, it's that idea that, because so much drug education lies about weed, that same education loses credibility on their claims about harder drugs when you realize weed is basically harmless.

I totally understand where that guy is coming from. The addiction is still the poster's *fault*, but I had that same kind of experience with DAREAA RonThank you!!!Oh I love getting introspective. I enjoy acid a ton and never have a problem on that. It’s just weed comes with so much paranoia and anxietyyeah either way pot definitely doesnt make it worse. There has got to be a better more common trigger to make a meme with, this one doesnt feel like a dope head even made it... whatever lol

&#x200B;

btw grats on 6 months man that shit is hardBetter for your physical and mental health long term too, but some people can't do itSame here. I start to question everything in my life. It's like every insecurity of mine gets amplified. 

Oh and I always think I'm dying.Big oof, unironically. I feel like you had it worse, since you had the experience.

I would totally be a stoner if I could. The idea of having a bowl ready as soon as I get home from work, just seems fantastic. I can't drink either, so damn, I got no realistic simple release.

Cbd, you have any experience with it? I kind of want to try it, but I'm so cynical and jaded.Ive been trying on and off for 25 years, high cbd or low THC, doesn't make much of a difference.
Every stoner I've met has some system, or plan, they're so certain that pot is perfect for everyone.
Like *so* sure that I've gotten in arguments with these guys telling me I'm doing it wrong or somehow just don't get it.

I've seen guys pick up Oxy, go for a week straight, and say 'meh' and drop it. I aint gonna yell at that mofo that he's somehow doing it wrong.

Shits different for different people.lol ?Smoke more weed? that will send them strait into psychosis, weed isn’t for everyone mateOh for sure, it helped me with some pretty bad joint inflammation/pain from my hep c, and some side effects from my bipolar meds. Just didn’t do much to help with cravings or withdrawals is all.

Edit: I really do hope you find whatever help you need tho! Methadone works for me but I understand MAT is not an option for everyone.I dated a girl recently who had to smoke pot every single time we hung out. I don’t smoke and yet she pressured me into smoking and then got mad when all I wanted to do was lay in bed....I told her that I’m a lightweight but she still insisted I smoke and smoke and smoke. Also told her that I’d get in trouble if someone found out she was smoking in my room (I live in a building that doesn’t tolerate that) but she didn’t care, she just HAD to do it. First time in my life I’ve ever seen someone addicted to weed.Junkies don’t have a monopoly on suffering man. That’s just your ego speaking. And to be clear, I am a junkie myselfNot even pills really. If you use pills habitually people will show some concern, but everyone freaks the fuck out when you mention the boogeyman heroin. Even if youre telling a story about doing it that one time.Yea I agree. I will say that I don't think the potential for addiction is as much as some other drugs, but certain types of people are definitely susceptible to pot addiction, myself included.Fair enough. Opiates can ruin your life no matter who you are though, don't make a mistake and think you are stronger than them. I agree marijuana is a different case. I guess a more accurate statement is that I was not strong enough to resist the influence of these drugs and that ruined my life, but that's kind of arguing semantics.Oh I totally get where both of you are coming from. BUT we all need to havr some personal responsibility in doing some research ourselves into things before we try them. I've smoked weed thousands of times and tried various drugs but not dope just because of the risk factor. I know there is a chance it could kill me and thats not a chance I want to take. Ya know what I mean?Well I've definitely have talked to a lot of dope users who have got clean and any substance will make them crave their doc. I never understood it but everyone's recovery is differnt. I can smoke daily and drink a few times a week and my cravings aren't more intense and sometimes non existent qhen I'm pretty fried and zoned out.

Definitely a case by case situation. Mainky why I don't go to meetings, I like the fellowship and communication but I cant be 100% honest without having all these old heads hop down my throat about weed and kratomAnything at this point gives me the anxiety. I was at my college for the first time and took CBD before i went, was so paranoid someone would think im on drugs i almost cried. My anxiety disorder is a bitch. Can't even take cbd anymore.. if an anxiety disorder is what you have, i recommend staying away from weed and trying CBD. dont be put down by my experience, its very rare that someone has what i have. Originally cbd helped me a LOT, and for a long time. Definitely try cbd in a small dose.when people say oxy just makes them sleepy i want to beat them halfway to death and see if a perc30 sounds good now but what you’ve written is factsI guarantee you that there will be no days long psychosis like with stims if you smoke s couple more bowls.

Greening our is not the same.It’s difficult to pinpoint exact problems though cause everything makes everything else worse and diagnosing has been a nightmare. I’m starting new antidepressants soon which will (hopefully) help me lose the weight the last ones made me gain and CBD might help me cope with side effects and bad days beyond that. But I’m not making bullshit promises to stop doing opiates when I have no reason or desire to stop. So I need to look at why and work from that angle. Idk. Thanks and good luck too, I might do an experiment and see if it helps with pain better than codeine and write about it if anything happens.My ex-gf was the same way. I don’t really smoke, never really cared for it, sometimes I’m down to take a couple rips if I’m already in bed and don’t have anything else to do that day. 

But man she smoked all the time. Basically from when she woke up, to right before bed. She’d smoke on her way to work, on her lunch break, and when she got off. Idk how she got anything accomplished. Well, actually, she didn’t get anything accomplished.

It was kind of unattractive. The fact that every time we hung out she had to get blitzed. I wasn’t even using opiates or anything at the time.Do you know the difference between benzo/opiate withdrawal and weed withdrawal. They don’t really compare. No matter how much weed you’d smoke.yeah, thats part of the reason I didnt get into NA much, the community is nice, but I couldnt do the total abstinence. I've been off dope for a long time, but was on subs forever, but anyway, im off everything opiate and cocaine now, but I still enjoy kratom and alcohol, and even a benzo once in a blue moon, and im fine. I still have cravings too but they've just flashes at this point, they disappear as soon as they come usually, but other substances dont make it worse. I mean its still a balance, but all of life is.

guess we are lucky to be able to use some things responsibly stillCan't stand 12 step groupsIm anxiety/depression/addiction.

I take SSRIs for the anxiety and depression but it's not perfect. It's just that for the past bunch of years, THC and cbd have been pushed as the cure for everything, so I dunno what is true or not. THC gives me panic attacks even at the smallest doses, I know cbd is supposed to not be psychoactive but yeah... Thanks for the insight.Lmao. It's like, well... Give me them, wtf are you doing them for? Lol.Stupid.Ugh I feel that hard. My life for awhile was a mess of differentiating symptoms and correlations between mental health issues, physical illnesses, medication side effects, and withdrawal related problems. It’s evened out quite a bit now and I finally have a solid grasp on what I need day to day and what I can do without.

I’d love to hear how it works for you if you try it or some other solutions!I do, yes. I am intimately familiar. I just detoxed myself from 4 mg Etizolam taken daily for over a year—been totally off only the last 9 days, so if anything I’m still in the thick of it—and while I have been stable on bupe for the last several years, I was previously on heroin for about 8. So yeah, I get detox, just as much or more than anyone else on this sub. And I’ll say this, detox is only a moment in time. It passes. And because it passes it really ought not to be the moment of comparison. You have no idea how other addicts—weed, heroin or otherwise—feel on a day to day basis. Some of them may very well be suicidal. Let me ask you a question: why do you feel the need to believe that your pain is greater than others? What do you get from that? I mean you just admitted that these people “never change”. How fucked up do you have to be such that you can never change?Ya definitely consider myself lucky, took me a second trip to rehab to pick this 6 months up. Longest I haven't taken opiates since I was 15 and am 21 as of last Wednesday so shits crazy. 

I had bits of no opiate use in the time frame and I only used a few times a month when I was 15 and 16 but once I turned 17 it was 3-7 days a week other than the few times I tried kicking. Shit feels good not having to have a needle and dope on me 24/7 and knowing my parents aren't thinking about me dieing daily is a plusRecovering from heroin and cocaine use is so different for everyone. I am glad more people realize that because for years I listened to 12 steppers tell me and others that if you dont hit bottom, and if you dont do 100% abstinence and do the program 100% you will relapse and die. I have heard that 100s of times from long timers speaking for everyone apparently. But I digress. I'm in no perfect position but my use is much less frequent and my life quality is 10x better being on maintenance and occasionally smoking weed, and using psychs rarely and having a half a drink once in a blue moon.Ya they think you have to do it one set way or you'll go back to your doc but everyone's recovery is differnt. My dad used to be a crackhead for years got clean in 98 the year I was born did na/aa for 5 years heavy and then eventually went back to smoking bud and drinking. Hasn't touched rock in 21 years, he had a drinking problem for a little while but nothing super crazy.

When I went to rehab I used it as a tool to stop opiates and benzos, but never had the intention to be 100% sober because thats not what I want in lifeForsure. Its different for everyone. You'll only know if it works for you if you try it. My advice, do it a day where you have nothing going on and free time on your hands, take no more than 5-10mg and see how you feel. Cheers.You’re stupid. Tolerance occurs with almost all drugsI was simply comparing the severity of withdrawal. I’ve had my fair share of suffering and suicidal ideation. 

I just know from personal experience that peoples’ personalities and world views rarely change.I think most anyone on this sub would know that there is a difference between opioid and weed withdrawal, it almost doesn’t need to be compared @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Stolen from r/ImGoingToHellForThis, Content: , ups: 712, downs: 0Lol no more wasting money on rehab and locking doorsI can set my purse down and come back & all my pills & money will still be there. What a relief.Lol that’s the kind of Humor I’m into I'm classy and graduated to bottle caps and bottoms of cans of beer/soda long ago. [deleted]i love it. they probably spent tens of thousands on rehab and various treatments anyway. lots of us would find that beneficial!“My son died and know I don’t have to count my spoons anymore”

Edit: i swear every addict has extremely dark humor! Idk if it’s the lifestyle or the fact that we’ve all lost so many friends that the way we deal with it is by dark humor!

Heroin/fetynal is legit killing our whole generation!
Our government really fucked up when they cut down hard on perks ...Knew a pretty bad h addict was staying at a friends in his garage as he apparently wasn’t even allowed inside. No it wasn’t only the spoons, but one time all the silverware went missing, probably traded for Fuck heating your shots, get a contact case, some saline and shake it up. Boom now you have shots for the day [deleted]Oofalmost no one will think of it this way. they'll probably blame themselves and wish they forced rehab on them. sounds like its time to kill the kidThat’s the al-anon version.Scavanged cans and mud puddle water...  Gotta boost your immune system!There’s been a lot of research reports about shooting from the bottom of cans gives the user aluminum poising so watch out. It doesn’t even need to be heated to get the poisoning.Yeah me too after the coffee lounge next to the pharmacy drilled holes in the spoons. Damn spoil sports. They charge enough to supply you a complimentary spoon. The last sentence is shocking.  0_e[deleted]I don't know - going away to get some personal/private time on your son's death's anniversary doesn't sound out of line to me. But of course you know them better than anyone here.I'm confused how there's anything wrong with that. Not like they chose that date to go to Vegas and party or somethingThey probably had already mourned for, and accepted his death way before it happened so as to be ready for it; it’s the easiest way for a parent to cope after giving up any hope of a change. I would think that when it did happen, soon afterwards, they’d  be somewhat relieved because from then on they no longer had to be reminded of the fact their son/daughter while alive, was going to be dead soon.Staying at the house would remind them to much of the son that they lost. The house and the neighborhood are full if his memories.

People grieve differently. Some folks must face raw emotion without an opiate crush.It's a jokei like to suck up water from the toilet at the library i go to before i catch the bus homeIf I'm IVing, I'm not worried about aluminum poisoning. Im sorry buddy. It sounds like your life is really hard and sad right now. It has to be super tough each day. Ill be thinking about you. [deleted]They must grieve at home God damnitThis is absolutely true—I’m an addict but it was a short run and I got clean so I hope my family didn’t have to mentally write me off to survive. They knew something was up but I never stole from them or hurt them in any direct way.

My younger brother (he is 31 now) has been virtually constantly drunk since he was 17 years old. I know that at a certain point in the madness I started to grieve his death because it seemed inevitable and there is just so much sorrow in doing that but in myself and for myself it was 100% necessary.

He’s currently waking up bleeding from his gums and other mucus membranes daily and refuses to see a doctor even when I, his brother, am a doctor and am telling him this is a serious problem, brother.I know but some people honestly probably think their family would be better off if they killed themselves.I could never bring myself to go that far... Done that a couple times! At least from the back tank anyway. Hell gotta have itNo, thats exactly how they got aluminum poisoning by shooting.

There are hundreds of reports like these:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16749550/

Be careful.Um boyo if I'm IVing I'm trying to get high and aluminum unfortunately isn't gonna get me turnt sooooooooooo


Just cuz I'm a junkie doesn't mean I don't know where my priorities are lmaoFuck it share away that’s deep stuff.I mean they weren’t wrong? You guys wer the assholes in that situation lol me and my girl use and I know I’m hurting my mom by using but I don’t pretend like she’s the dick when she’s fed up with me. I'm sorry for your loss. Just out of random curiosity, is your user name based off Juice WRLDs song?They should have locked you and the fiance out of the house and blocked all communication. The cops could watch the house during the beach vacation. You two needed no parental assistance hitting bottom.

Parents of addicts need not let their dreams be memes.I know I’m late to the party- but I’m really sorry to hear about your brother. I lost 4 different family members/friends over the last two years to heroin and alcohol. Honestly heroin is faster and you can accept that the end is close a lot easier-as awful as it sounds. Alcohol is long and drawn out and takes  years to peak into the truly awful final form. I hope you find peace in this situation. It’s not easy- but as you know he’s gotta want to change.Addiction has a way of surprising you.

Oh the places we'll go.i mean...theyre nice ass bathrooms. like, i would shit without lining the seat with 200 layers of toilet paperI think you misread. If I'm IVing. I don't care about getting aluminum poisoning. Where did I say I was getting high on ALUMINUM? SeletedThank you so much. Alcohol is definitely ‘the long goodbye’ compared to heroin.

I have peace with it, but at the same time I’m fiercely ready to help him (I have a legal conservatorship now to look after his interests when he cannot.)Well that’s silly. Harm reduction is the way to go. lol cracking me up ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I made my friend into a meme and now I'm finding him all over the internet in different memes, Content: , ups: 709, downs: 0I always look to see if the guy still has strings on his hoodie/sneakers �The east coast dope fiend lol.���This is literally a man at NA last night this is excellent lmao.  hope your friend enjoys his notoriety!Looks like he would have a thick boston accent and be really supportive in NA meetingsRob dyrdek looking assHa!  He does have that look. Reminds me of a guy I was in treatment with. He was really proud of this one:

Yo dog I used to take my needle and pull raindrops offa car windows for water. 

Of course ha had all the usual shit. Close calls with cops. Getting shot at in philly. Xanax and the most blazing fire you can put in your veins, dawg. Because he's part of the 
"Flat Bill Society" and this is entirely too accurate ���Looks like rob dyrdek Lmao goood shit.."No bro I was literally doing 4g a day bro" ....

3 days later...

"Fuck I got soooo high on suboxone I fuckin love that shit I was puking my brains out"Scumbag Steve in a way lolLet’s see some more memesThis is gold I laughed way too hard at this Honestly, I feel like at least a quarter of all dope fiends look like this, just maybe a bit skinnier lol. I can actually hear this picture talking. "yeah bro at my peak bro I was pushing like 3 thou blues out my basement bro."  "I was making like 10k a month at one point yo" "my bro was actually setting up a lab in my basement before I got popped bro it was gonna be lit" 

And my all time favorite  "Hey bro can I borrow a dollar for the vending machine I got you tomorrow yo." ���They still make Echo clothing? This wouldn't happen to be in Massachusetts would it??"Bro, bro.... you don't understand ...."I hope he’s proudHAHAHe’s also the guy who goes “anyone got a bogey” or anyone need those I got some oxy in the car ����LmaooooWord LOLWhen I see an ecko sweatshirt I think drug problemLmaoIs this the original meme?Lol went into rehab no strings on my timbs. They nurses there gave me twine to tie them up cuz they couldn't stand the sound of them draggingDude I bought dope from in college was always freaking out on his girlfriend.. .

"WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY SHOELACES?!?"Fuuuuck I have waaaayyyyyy to many hoodies without the strings nowCan you tell by the clothing?I think he’s from Jersey lolThis is a Seattle Mariners hat, isn't it? Which would make him likely from the West Coast if not atleast a fan of Seattle. But they typically look the same over here too. I usually hate stereotypes, but they are too often true.is it literally?The other ones say "dudes fresh outta prison always take pics like this" and "Dudes that host MTV always pose like this" lol Damn, I always wear a flat bill snap back, i hate im now a member of this society.I’m watching ridiculous thinking the same thing but in this case the ecko hoodie stays.On itThat's what say when I see Ecko shit. Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of taking the shoe laces lolLmao. I’m currently wearing Docs. They’re purple, but one of the laces is black — for this exact reason. (Hey. At least I cleaned up and found a replacement, at some point.)Yeah it’s a dead give away I’m on the west coast too. But people from the east coast come out there for rehab all the time. I actually have a friend from sober living who was from Maine. He had a similar grey ecko hoodie and always wore fitted caps.I can tell cuz of the way it is.Jersey dude would have more facial hair, earrings and probably a little bigger if he’s stayed clean enough to get the sobriety steroids flowing.Was gonna say, this is definitely the height of Kenso fashion. Eh, the location of a team is usually irrelevant, it's all about the outfit and colors matching IME. Hahahah no but looks exactly like a guy I saw bumming cigs outside NAThese kids don’t understand what words mean anymore. #facts #literally #imdyingTo be fair, he looks like a shitty Rob Dyrdek��oh thats funny loltbf,it is just one part of the mosaic that is the white boy dope fiend. You need baggy clothing and a hoodie as well, in many cases a very edged beard. Dunno how else to say it but the facial hair often has fucking corners.Eh, the hat is common to all men in their late 20s to mid 30s in the NY/NJ/PA/CT/MA area, whether they do drugs or not. Snap back is different than a fitted. To me, the fitted looks kinda douchey, I’m a SnapBack man myself, but also beanies and curved brim strap backs. Gotta have variety. RidiculousnessPh yeah hella more memesThey didn't take them. I lost them using them to tie off.They don't take your shoelaces in rehab lol i've used shoelaces/hoodie strings as a tie off & believe that's what u/push__ did as well  Junkies in mass all look exactly the same. Middle tier grown up wiggers with corny and lazily executed hip hop aesthetic and the nasally Boston weasel voices you thought only occurred in movies making a caricature of southie kehds

Bonus points for an always perfectly cropped chin straplmao i'm on the west coast and had a friend from sober living that was from Boston and wore Ecko hoodies and fitted caps all the time as wellFrom E. C. CAN confirm �Couldnt agree moreKensington and jersey fashion nothing alike, my friend. Lol literally will soon have a new definition You mean an even shittier Robby D. Dude is a scumb bag and a halfYeah damn auto correctAhhhhhhOhhhh it all makes sense now. I don’t think about that cuz I don’t tie off They take your laces and hoodie strings at the mental hospital. Lol yupI can confirm most detox centers will take your shoe laces especially if they also deal with mental health. But you don’t have to be suicidal they still take all your strings. I wouldn’t call it rehab it’s usually where you go before rehab.the lighting, the trees, the color of the guys hair and skin tone, all dead give aways that this man is barrie ontario canada His post implies Kenso is *in* NJ. Literally It already does...Yeah. It’s annoying. Why is my boy robby d such a scumbag thanks cap'n yupppLove the username lmaoHe fucked mini horse.  Thanks!Wait lol he fucked a miniature horse?

I roll into the ICU to find him on a Dilaudid drip with a button. Got to say I was super jealous…hhahahahhahhaaYup :( LolIts funny cuz its true. It's pathetic cuz its true. � I can't count the number of times I've legit wished for a terminal illness so I could live a couple months in a drug induced bliss til I peacefully drift away forevaaaaa. Omg I'm tapped.I feel personally targeted lmaoI actually got yelled at once for pushing the morphing button to much..lolReal shit  I always liked the 2hr breakthrough shots when the morphine drip didn't cut it. [deleted]I’ve considered stealing there bag and running. A close relative of mine gets perscribed name brand hydromorphone 4mg and gets like 200+ at a time. They have chronic pain and need them, and their insurance is so good they barely pay out of pocket for them. So I'm very jealous.

Every time I visit them (once or twice a month) I end up stealing 20-40 of them (I'm horrible I know). Which is what basically ended up getting me hooked on the things but ah wellWhen my dad was dying in hospice, they had me go fill a script for something that they rubbed on his forehead when he would wince or make any other facial expression, as he was more or less completely out of it from liver failure.  He couldn’t say if he was in pain.  I was super out of it because of the whole experience and I was actually clean at the time so I didn’t even look to see what it was.  Anyone have any idea what that stuff was?  The nurses made a huge deal out of it acting like it was the god of all opiates so I’m guessing some sort of roll on fent?  This was in February of 2008 if that helps.  Just curious if anyone knows what that shit was.  It worked super fast.  His eyes would be squished up and less than 5 minutes after putting it on he would be “relaxed” again.  Yo. All fuckin day I was just on a morhpine IV this Thursday. First experience with painkillers and it was kind of fun considering my situation My father-in-law in currently in the hospital with a tear in the lining of his heart and a broken hip. They are giving him 4 mgs of Dilaudid every few hours. I literally can't take my eyes off of the vials as they fill the syringe. I feel like I'm drooling. My heart beats faster and I want to run up to the ICU nurse, grab the syringe and run off and lock myself in the bathroom and slam it. It's like torture for me but at the same time I get off on watching him get injections. I know it's insane but I can't help myself. I'm jealous of a poor, broken, shell of a man. Lol I can definitely relate clear example of how insane dope/addiction will make you I had testicular torsion and got put on a fentanyl drip once with a button, nurses told me I spam clicked it and started hallucinating saying theres people tryna kill meNoLol yup! I’m always like, I wonder exactly HOW much they keep on that ambulance. 

Seriously what are we thinking? There's a scene in the wire we're bubbles tried to rob an ambulance for drugs and needlesWell when I had my car crash I know my aunt who had more serious injury than me got three full vials/shots of fentanyl and was still in pain... Not counting the shots given the previous three to five hours excavating her from the car (they had to saw off the van in half and take her out with the whole car seat.)hmmm I wonder why you never hear of junkies robbing ambulances?IV ativan? should I be shooting up my lorazepam?!?They got fent tooThat! Specialy when in WD'S.They gave me fentanyl when I rode in an ambulance. 1 of 2 micrograms I think. They also got IV valium in thdre. Had to have a seizure and ativan not work to get it thoCrazy how a substance can make you envy a seriously injured person and want to switch places with them, some powerful shit...I had a PCA dilaudid pump before, for an entire week. Good times I've felt the same exact way Everyone that knows me well enough to make decisions in the case of my incapacitation knows that I want to be euthanized by a slow morphine drip over the course of a day should all hope be lost. Life has so much to offer you. Just hang in there and wait and see :)Why? Those things are on a timer. Once you've had all you are allowed over a period of time, you are locked out until that period has passed. (Prevents accidental ~~euphoria~~ overdose.) You sure you were pressing the pain pump and not the nurse call??The mighty morphing button?just say fuck it and get some heroin tbhEspecially when you’re the kind of person who has tantrums and walks into traffic on purpose I started the same way only with oxy 15s and 20s from my grandpa and grandma so don't feel too bad lolprobably fentMaybe fentanyl? I'm not sure, not familiar with any topical opiates Junkie shit is what we be thinking �I've definitely thought about/planned on how to break into our small towns ambulances.

Only one or two locked doors away from i.v. blissYeah pain killers don’t really do anything except make you care less. When I got stabbed multiple times I already on 16mg Dilaudid IV and it hurt. Medics came and gave me another 2 shots of an unknown dosage. Then gave me two shots of fentanyl 50 mcg each. Still hurt. But what did help. Was ketamine. By god they gave me that IM and I was in another world with no pain. Cuz of jail.. and detoxing in county ain't no fun..I don't think you can shoot it up with just water, but don't quote me on that. I've had IV ativan many times in the ER. NiceYou *had* to have a seizure? Like, medically induced?I don’t even feel bad about, just wanna have a drip w a button...It was the best of times �https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bodkin_AdamsIn palliative care, it's common for the doses of benzos and opioids to be upped to help the person drift away faster and easier. It's not technically euthanasia, but it does make it happen faster. That’s what I was guessing.  I have had the patches before and they take a good long while to kick in.  I haven’t ever applied the gel directly to the skin to see onset time.  But I would imagine it’s way faster.  Yeah I’m guessing that’s what it was.  Probably the liquid gel without a barrier like the patches have.  I’m not sure though.   The black hole. I visit that place from time to time. 

Ketamine is such a weird substance my god...doesnt stop most people tho from all other wreckless shit.No like I wouldn't have been able to get the IV valium if I didn't have a seizure. I was begging for a benzo bc I could feel a seizure coming on but they didn't listen and sure enough I had one When season 7 of Three's Company is hilarious at 4am despite the broken vertebrae, ribs and stomach injections.. there's probably a blue button involved. It's not Bodkin Adams so much as Harold Shipman who put an end to UK doctors free and easy use of opiates.
Its taken 20 years, but even the old private London clinics where you could get pretty much whatever you desired so long as you could pay, are finally biting the dust, because almost every dose and script of anything good is now tracked and traced.
Ah, for the days when doctors used to toss rohypnol scripts out of their third floor Baker St. window cos the secretary was at lunch and they couldnt be bothered to let you in themself.If I make it to that age, that'll be me. I’ve been K Holed 3x. Twice from the hospital when I was in four points and they wanted to calm me down. They gave me 3 shots and I fought them as hard as I can till they busted out the ketamine. I had a pretty decent benzo tolerance so they
Couldn’t get me with the Ativan. When they busted out the zyprexa I thought I had it. I was fighting so hard to stay awake then they busted out the K. Then the first time was the medics. Not so enjoyable for me. Oh, my bad. Guess I totally misread it. Are you epileptic?Blue buttons are my favorite �A shame.When people take too much on parties they do the same, they try to fight the feeling. 
You cant.
Just let it be and disconect from your body and ego. There is no way to feel fear once into the K Hole if you go as far as dead of your ego. I take it as a travel into myself.Similar experience, I didn't have my keppra for about 3 days and the right side of my body began locking up and I sounded like a fish. The started a line in the ambulance but couldn't give me any midazolam because I wasn't in a full seizure. Was an absolutely terrible ride to the hospital. Once I got there, the dumbass doxtor wanted to give me BENADRYL at first. Nevermind that I'm allergic to it, but why in the hell would you give someone that is obviously having a pseudo seizure benadryl, of all things? Someone changed her mind though and they gave me 2mg of ativan and it stopped in 30 seconds. Wish I had gotten the midazolam instead. Man that stuff is very euphoric.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Hate when this happens, Content: , ups: 700, downs: 0LmaoooI have terrible insomnia. When I actually do sleep, it’s like hibernation. I was in the hospital for a totally unrelated thing and I fell asleep after several restless nights (no one can sleep in the hospital) I dozed off. I was on a regimented pain med schedule at home. When some idiot decided i was “unresponsive” because I didn’t answer right away (I had earplugs in, too) I got my first and only Narcan shot. I thought I was dying. Can I shake you to make sure?[deleted]Damn it , Bobby!I knew I a dopehead near my old apartment in Baltimore that had a "please dont narcan" sign on him. Everyday he was napping on the neighbors trashcans. Fucking love thisA few years ago I was withdrawing from benzos and I had a seizure while I was outside. Someone called the ambulance and the stupid ass paramedic saw I had tracks well he narcaned me not knowing I was on methadone maintenance because he immediately thought I was overdosing on opiates when he saw tracks. I had them because I was banging ketamine a few days before. I was in the worst agony imaginable. I had already missed my dose that day because the benzo withdrawal was too much. Then the asshole Dr at the hospital wouldn't give me any methadone even though I missed that day and was narcaned. I felt like shit for a week until my dose stabilized again.Suboxone for the winWow that's rough. A month ago I fell out on a sidewalk in the evening. It was cold af and i was unresponsive for a long time but eventually the small crowd of ppl surrounding me were able to wake me momentarily. They asked if I was ok and offered me some bomb food. I said I'm ok then fell back out (while trying to eat lol) and woke up later and everything was closed and the ppl gone. Some1 had put a couple blankets on me and some ppl had apparently been dropping change (like $20 total) in a pile next to me. Anyway I'm stoned so I'm rambling but I think my point was how unfair the universe is that you had to go through that just bc your a heavy sleeper and I was strung out and fell out in public and they gave me some $ instead of narcaning me which I maybe needed. But this did occur in the Mexican part of the hood and yes I did buy more drugs with the money they left me. Crazy times.WOW that’s some next next level incompetence right there. I know this is absurd but anyone that does that should be forced to take a fat dose of opioids and then promptly narcan’d themselves. HOW DOES IT FEEL U DUMB CUNT?? lolDon't people check for breathing or pulse before doing something like that? I mean, as long as someone is breathing rather normally (and has a heartbeat), everything's fine to me. At least fine as in "just keep an eye on him".not as terrible as dying Jesus, dude. Have you learned to handle your shit a little better since this incident? ��Quit being homeless, OpiLobster. It sounds dangerous to sleep on a sidewalk all sedated. You risk getting raped or robbed.  :-(I remember you!  How's life dude?  You quit scaring the Mexican abuelas?  Srs though Mexicans want no trouble so you're safe from miss 911 trigger finger.Wow dude. JJ was certainly there for you. That could have turned out a *lot* worse. Tell me about it. Since I had been on a long time pain med regiment, the Narcan hit me so hard. I pulled that gross hospital bed cover over my head and waited to die. The pain and nausea were completely overwhelming. I was too sick to bitch about it but, my personal doctors on staff at the hospital gave the first year resident, that ordered the Narcan shot, several new defecation portals. [deleted]He’s prolly napping on the sidewalk so he can’t reply until he comes to. I'm not on the streets anymore lol.I'm good now. I quit dope and am on my way to having a normalish life. I moved away from where I was and moved in with a friend. oh, same. i’ve been narcan’d once before (imo i didn’t really need it, i was just in a deep nod), but then again i’m not sure we ever *really* think we need it lol. in my experience, it wasn’t as severe as the self-induced precipitated withdrawl symptoms i brought upon myself after injecting opiates whilst still having too much suboxone in my system. both are extremely unpleasant, yet bearable. Been off dope for a month now. Have decent place to live but if I relapse I'll be right back bc I have to push shit to the limit I cant just do a lilOk cool!

No more sleeping on the sidewalk.

*giving you two thumbs up*
Oh thats good to hear.  Congrats.[deleted]Yea that’s how it works for most of us man even tho we’ll do so well then for some fucked up reason trick ourselves that we can control our use and moderate it somehow haha. Sometimes but it always gets out of hand sooner or later. Glad you’re doing well now it’s not easy. The struggle is real.  I remember when you posted that story a while back, glad you're doing OK man. It's not like I meant to sleep there. I've fallen out a lot of weird places but I've been using a long time. This was the worst though bc there were so many ppl who passed by. I also once woke up on the floor of a Wendy's bathroom from a fent hot spot. Every time I wake up like that I think "wtf lobster why would you go to sleep here, hope no one saw" then I put it together and think "wow I could've died".excellent choice, honestly, i couldn’t be more proud of a stranger ❤️I had to ghost everyone and move to another state to get off dope. Shits insane.Doing soooooo much better now. I look and feel like a different person already. Ty.If you're homeless, just buy a homeI did. Took me a while to figure that out tho. I just kept forgetting what they were called so it took me a while. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Sad but true, Content: , ups: 702, downs: 0I’ll do these in loving memory of gmaI wish I had grandparents so they could die again and leave me pills lmao That's terrible jkI found a bottle 2 years ago in my dads storage. I was helping him move and I came across my stepmothers box of medications. She died from cancer in 99 or 00.   
She was prescribed 5 80s in the morning and 5 80s in the evening. I already know everyone is going to call me a liar. I wish I kept the bottle. I grabbed the bottle and when I got alone later that night I counted them. There was 1 oc80 missing. The bottle contained 299 OC 80s. 

I about had a heart attack. I was 2 weeks out of rehab, clean from a bad tar habit. This bottle scared me, I didn’t want to die. I couldn’t resist I ended up selling about 20 of them for $1 a mg, sharing about 50 of them with friends and I did the rest. These pills were sitting in storage for years in Seattle so they never got too hot or too cold, but the potency went down hill. 

The bottle was dated 1999 and if I remember correctly it had a 2002-2003 expiration date. I went back to the box a couple weeks later to see what else I could find and got about 20 100mcg fent patches, and 2 bottles of liquid oxycodone. It was a hell of a haul. The last time I looked the only thing left was a huge bottle of propoxapine aka darvocet. It’s a bottle of at least 500. Dude if that happened.... I'd pray to nt grandma everynight thanking her. Yes I relapsed. I spent about a week and a half helping my dad move. It took 3 days of daily use and I was starting to get sick. Out of the 299 oc80s I had approximately 200 of them in 4 weeks or maybe 3 and a half weeks. 3 days before I ran out I made an appointment with a suboxone dr. I had a relatively easy transition that time.Even in death Grammy stays leaving me treats �Lol i just farted i laughed so hard. I haven’t seen one of these since like 2005 (when I switched to bigger and better things) We used to call them jams when I was in high school lol 

-addict in recovery Y’all imma about to start doing voluntary in home hospice care. Cleaning old people houses and shit. Only touching things that expired years ago, swear. 
Best part is I have the look and old dudes in particular just enjoy having me talk to them XDThat would indeed be a miracle I’m not this lucky Man, I've never even seen an oxy 80. I thought they were an urban legend...My cousin got busted with 4,000 of these and 2 loaded pistols. 13 years Fed time.

Man, FL was the place to live in the 2000s. These were $35 a piece all day long. 40s were $20 and Roxy 30s for $10. OCxsz bless !do they still work? I remember watching my dad pour morphine syrup into cat litter when my grandma passed away. 

I was a teen at the time so watching them pour out a handle of her vodka was more painful but I didn’t know shit back then.The darvocet is still in the box. I didn’t touch them because it was recalled by the FDA years ago and if I remember correctly it’s like hydrocodone, it has acetaminophen in it. I told one of my buddies about them and he said he would take 100 of them if they were cheap cheap. Like .50 cents a piece.

Yes $80 a pill is a good price in the US for an OC80. Some will spend $2 to $3 a mg if curious or sick enough.Back when I was using, I had a service job. I got called out to this guys place and while I was doing the work he tells me, hey my mom just passed recently, I’ve got a bunch of her stuff downstairs I need to get rid of, take anything you want. Well, of course I go right to the medicine cabinet, I got about 50 oxy 5s, two full bottles of codiene and a brand new script of norcos. The other stuff was only a couple years expired so still pretty good. Man I feel sorry for my grandma... she’s allergic to codeine and thus most painkillers...Better say OC and not OP on the other side lol. ��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️�‍♂️��‍♂️


Funny if pope knew about opiates and someone hands him an OP and he’s like NOGETMEAN OC ONLY,’. I might bless an ABG 80 since it’s the sane difference.

OP 80 the pope screams “blastphomy blastphomy” “NO OPs!!!!!!!!!!!’nDude you could sell oxy OC80s is over here for like 160 or whatever you want name your price basically because they’re extinct they are like dinosaurs


He’ll have seen 30s go for $45-50 (middles ofc) but still I know people that would prob pay 2 hundo for an OC80 just to remember 

We smoked them up here and called them @beans” I stole over 100 OC 60s from my mom they were red but I smoked like 10 a day that week lol still feel horrible bc she had to use over $5k in cash and the asshole wouldn’t lower from $80 knowing it was for my mom and she really needed them bc she was scripted 360mg a day, fucker and he was supposed to be my “best friend” dealing for like 3 weeks went to his head God i miss the drainage taste of the old oxy 80s so bad. I have dreams about them all the time. Edited.Its even more terrible that i can say tbat and  not be joking!Hahaaaaaa brilliant, you deserve some gold but I’m poorI am going STRAIGHT to hell for laughing at this!Wow talk about a gold mine lolDaaaaaaaamn so 17 year old oxys. I mean you kinda HAVE to relapse with a find like that!

P.S. - Did you get withdrawals after doing the 50? I ask bc you said the potency went hella down so maybe withdrawals went hella down too lol idk? #junkiethoughtsI 100% believe this because I took a job in college cleaning out the basement of an office building which my friend’s dad had made available for storage for some church charity.  I found a motherlode of prescriptions in a box donated to a ‘medical’ missionary organization (it would have been super illegal for them to give this stuff out) which included at least 300 tablets of various painkillers and - legit, seriously, I doubt I will ever see this again - a 500ml bottle of *opium tincture* meant to treat diarrhea.  I wasn’t in full-blown junkie mode at the time so I foolishly shared a ton of this stuff with friends but Jesus Christ it was amazing to get a windfall like that.  I’m glad someone else got to taste the joy I experienced, or rather, that I got to enjoy a shade of the joy OP experienced.Jesus Christ... I’ve never had the pleasure of an OC80, or even an OP80 for that matter.. :( also, did you take any of the Darvocet? I came across like 20 propoxyphene pills a long time ago but they didn’t do much for me at all, they were very disappointing.. I’m just curious to hear someone else’s opinion on them since they’re relatively rare and not talked about anymore now that they’re discontinued in the statesSold them for $80 per OC80? People will pay that much?[Never has this meme been more relevant.](https://i.imgur.com/BKxhiU0.jpg)Hell yeah brotherAny chance you’re from CT? We called them jams here as well. Haven’t heard that anywhere else.Careful, most in home hospice places will press charges seeing as they consider all medications their property, not the patientsWhy do they enjoy talking to you?Yea you got the look. Nice hooters and cute face. You kind of look like Emilia Clarke.Thanks bro haha We'll all be joining you lolShe/he shared 50 with friends, sold 20, and did the rest. So they did about 229. I would assume that would come with a w/d. Haha. The interesting thing is that laudanum (opium+ethanol tincture) is still technically able to be prescribed by doctors in the US. Granted the DEA can set production quotas and probably set them to 0. But it's still technically possible I suppose.Until recently in the UK you could buy opium tincture or morphine solution OTC for diarrhoea. The concentration was low but still, I was buying OTC morphine just a few years ago.

Technically they're still legal to sell but wholesalers refuse to supply pharmacies with them anymore so I think production has stopped.I’ve had darvocet found some in my half sisters grandpas basement took about 10 of them lol, didn’t CWE or anything I was scared about the Tylenol but I didn’t give a fuck I wanted to get high. Felt like hydros basically they gave me a pretty good buzz even though I was doing a lot of dope and subs at the time. Yeah, Have you been living under a rock? Lol why do you think we have 90 percent heroin addicts on here? I remember paying 20-30 a pill back in ‘05. Then the doctors stopped prescribing them and everyone turned to D-block.It's crazy innit but it's supply and demand. They don't make them in the US anymore and they're super popular.

I pay £10 for an OC80 in the UK because oxy is an obscure drug here and not many people even know what it is. Boston. Close enough though.Eh I wouldn’t be joining a company. A lot of older people just hire person to person to have someone help around the house and with a few other things. I probably won’t wind up doing it anyway.Ah they’re old flirts. Harmless though. Lmao thanks XDwow wow wow


$80 for one single tablet or pill is RIDICULOUS. The high will last how many hours? It is not even an extended release formula. Costs over $10/hour of pleasure. 


FUCK 


THATI hear ya.. Just keep in mind, whoever you are to the patient, the medications often belong to the home care company as far as they and the law are concerned. Been down that road myself as well as a friend who took from grandpa, and grandpa said he didn't care, that he gave them to her. She still got felonies for it. Feel free to dm me some nudes lmfao jk
Exactly. Buy heroin instead you get way more bang for your buck, it’s easier to find, and there’s a limitless supply of it. Live clean and opiate-free, rather.Yes. A heroin addiction is unsustainable. I relapsed after 2 years off dope when I got surgery last month. I was on suboxone and that made the meds the docs gave me entirely ineffective. So I did dope for a month during the worst of the pain and quit almost two weeks ago and got back on my subs. 2 weeks clean Friday. :) Good going! Take your time recovering from surgery. Do not try to rush it. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Funny, Content: , ups: 698, downs: 0Hahahahaha now this meme is funny. I thought the bottom was going to say " what u need?"Lol.

Which exports sarcasmI know I was kidding. I dk why I got 12 down votes. I was just saying how crazy stereotypes are embedded in us and we dont even mean any harm or realize them. Everybody has them and runs into them. It isn't just to one race obviously either. Each sees the other, with certain stereotypes, engrained into us by culture without even noticing.I've personally only known addicts who sold to provide their habit. I've never had a Latino plug either. I don't live neat a major Latino community region tho.  By this comment, I'm not implying, insinuating, suggesting, or saying anything derogatory about black people.  I'm just stating my personal experiences.  They've all been at least half black.  They come from all levels of society and reside in all levels of living areas/housing levels.  

I chalk it up to them keeping the supplier in the family. As to spread the profits around the people close to them. I know for certain some areas have barely any job opportunities and people travel 30 to 40 minutes just to get restaurant jobs.  The bus line doesn't run far out enough to suburbs with the jobs,they need. The ones that do run 5 am and head back at 7 pm. Mon to Fri.  Thr Other buses that are similar are:  mon wed Fri or tues thur sat... 

This city makes having a car A necessity to earn a living. Insurance doesn't transfer and each person needs a policy. So one person with a policy doesn't cover, the family car. 

The bus is 3.50 to get on and 7 for a day pass, 280 a month. 2400 for a yearly pass.  Everywhere you go garages are 15 to 20 for the day.  Meter officers come every 2 hours. They ticket you even sitting in the spot waiting for food you ordered. The minimum is 2 dollars on the meter and it doesn't take cash any more.

the computer signals when time expires or a car has sat over the designated limit. Tickets are 120. News report said 37% of our county's inmate location is in there for unpaid tickets.  Picked up clueless of the warrant,  then they are  brought in on a warrant they didn't kno about. 

 I had a ticket too and never got the papers to inform me.   2 weeks after my warrant was issued, I got my notice to show up go court to have the trial concerning the ticket( which they issue a warrant if u don't show)....
They treated me awful and a burglar because I said I didn't even get the notice. All 3 came in the next month, but they don't care.

 This is the norm.  They charge you a fee for this too. Then they charge you a fee for paying online( 8 bucks) 
Of course course they won't take payment at the court. ( payment is an Indian call center too so that fee isn't even sustaining a local job)


Finally, construction zones are set up on every major hi way for 15 miles around and in the city. They have 3 major on Ramps and exits closed since march with no work since.  Speed limit is 45 and although 75% of the areas haven't had any work done since they laid out the cones, its triple the fee from construction zone. Mine was 70 in a 45. The flashing active zone wasnt on, no one has touched the road and it was 3 am. I got 4 points and a fine of 780.


All of us  are getting raped by city and state. This shit makes it near impossible to finance a car, in a city, where it's a necessity, to earn a living.

So I don't blame people who had all the cards stacked against them for dealing. This shit makes me disgusted. I pay enough taxes and our country is going to help despite them. Greedy savagesI like you ice.  You're cool like your handle. What did you expect? Lol never much of an in between there.lol you didLmao. Checks out. WisconsinIdahoYep.

Do something positive for once ok? Thx. Send me a private message and explain how youd like to amicably end your discontent with me. I hope you can find enough joy in your life to stop worrying about me, thanks! I could just list the names of who you are, but that's drama. Something I don't want to partake in.

A little ironic, dont you think? Its like rain... On your wedding day. It's like 22 tampons when all you need is to shart.SHITTTT WHITE!Eh ya I defly raved. I just totally see why so many black people in that situation decide to deal.  when You face all those things working against you, seems much more undrtstandableThanksThere isnt lol, unless they are from Milwaukee, otherwise WI is all farms and rednecksI lived there for 5 years. Cold copping there sucks! Chicago is where uts atNorth Dakota.ehHaha nah I hear you man. It's not as simple as people make it out to be. Everyone's just always like get a fucking real job. But depending where you live, your background, past, situation it's just not than simple man...Maine <3I hate that phrase. Get a job. I wish it was that simple. I’m lucky enough that I don’t have any criminal offenses and still have trouble finding a job. Days are spent filling out applications for nothing, so I just give up until I get filled with enough anxiety to motivate myself. I’ve got a job now but for how much longer might be in question. 

Not having a car is also terrible. The bus is a daily cost that adds up and might not always run or reach where I need to go. It’s rough. Some days I really just want to give up and start using again, see how long it takes before I get fired and fuck my grades up. It’s just hard to see a point to all this struggle and worry, even though I know drugs will not fuffill me YupSounds a lot like myself, I can tell you're not a stupid person though so you'll figure it out. Everything will work out the way it should @@@@@@@@@@ Title: It creeps up on you, Content: , ups: 697, downs: 0Oh. Shit.

Right?

Or is it?Creeps? That bitch is upon you and cripped your shit up hard and you don't even know it!! My wife works with a lady that thinks she isn't an addict because she takes what the doctor has prescribed to her for the past TEN YEARS!! 10/15s a DAY!! LMAO The clouds are the opioids? ⛅️ or the blue sky? You always think “I can just do it a couple times and I ‘lol be fineeeee, I won’t have to have withdrawals” and then a couple times turns into weeks (or even months) on end lol next thing you know, you can’t find anything for the first time in 10 weeks and you wake up in bed after about ZERO hours of sleep, sweaty and shaky, and at first you don’t know what’s wrong. Then you have that moment of “oh yeah, I forgot, I’ve been doing pills every day for 10 weeks” and just like that, it’s “get clean” time again I feel like I’m being hard targeted here lolSo. Fucking. Accurate. That’s why I set a hard limit of once a month. Take them Oxys like their holier blood of ChristTruthLmaoooo This is one of the most real posts I've seen here. It's an interesting question. At what point does it go from casual drug use to an addiction? In retrospect I feel like I got addicted within ten or twenty uses but that actually took years to accrue.DeepYeah my binges aren't anything to worry about. I stop when I run out I mean when I want and get sick for unrelated reasons, always some bullshit flu or stomach bug. Definitely nothing wrong with that.Only when she's abruptly cut off will she understand. I always wonder how people stay with heads buried in the sand like this in the game lolSnag her script and ask her how's she's feeling the next day lolThe mirror, bro. Objects are closer than they appear....Couldn't have said it better myself! I bet most people here can relate ��IMO the very moment I did something I would see as reprehensible before ie. stealing old pills from family's medicine cabinets is when it crossed a certain line imo. But where did it begin....? Who knows I mean even before drugs I remember having an addictive personality towards ANYTHING especially adrenaline things. I remember two things I was really into as a kid was rollercoasters and as a teenager paintball. And I would be like obsessed with that rush way before I knew what a rush was.Physical dependency would be when you experience flu-like symptoms when you stop using. Perhaps the best characterization I've ever heard is a drug counselor in a documentary saying that "addiction isn't about the drug as much as it is about what the drug does to your life." When drug use adversely impacts your personal finances, relationships, and mental health, then it becomes a "real" addiction imhoI think it's also very subjective and also a process that takes some time. So it's hard to find a specific point. That's her issue she doesn't get cutoff and idk how some people get scripts like this and for so long!??? She walks, talks, no cane, etc... I couldn't ever get a single benzo prescribed let alone anything over a 10mg perc.True fucking story. It happens fast too. I have serious neck/back and connective tissue problems, yet it’s been 7 mos. since my doc hung his coat up and said, “fuck the gov’t and they regs.” Being 30 yrs old doesn’t help. 

Folks if youre getting a script, fucked physically or not, set shit aside; even if you gotta lock it up somewhere. Ya wish I could!! I asked my wife wtf she says is wrong with her and she claims some fucking B's neck injury and something else. It's funny because I asked the wife to show me a picture of her the other week and she isn't a bad looking ladyAhh makes sense. Sorry, currently pretty high. ��Exactly. At some point you find yourself doing something that you would ordinarily consider to be dubious. That is a depressing and sobering moment. We get through it with the help of the opiods and we're well on our way to an addiction.Never even got a 5mg perc in 34 years.  Never came close to getting benzos either That’s so strange to me. All I told my doc was that I wasn’t sleeping well and that I’m stressed out (this was back during college) and he prescribed me Xanax right off the cuff, it seemed like he didn’t even have to think about it. [deleted]But also got the same thing for a pulled tooth! Idk how one relates to the other with prescribing the same thing!??? Broken bones hurt a hell of a lot more then having a tooth pulled. Dude I had a major anxiety attack, went to the ER and they just stuck me in a room for 30mins, came back and said are you better now? See ya later!Only thing I've had percs for was broken bones.Ya I know some peeps that have horrible addiction issues and they have a doctor prescribe them bars!?? Someone posted on r/opiates the other day with there scripts and they get 200 dillies and 225 30s!! And dude said that's cut down from what he originally was prescribed!! I don't get it Was this in a college town? Where I'm at they hand out Xanax and Adderall like its candy.I got prescribed 0.5mg clonazepam x2 daily without a problem for a couple panic attacks I had. Yeah, today was my 3 weekly appt with my GP for my OxyContin script & I took a quarter of a pill to constrict my pupils as usual, but I didn’t quite cut it properly so I ended up taking more like 1/3 of an 80mg and less like 1/4. 

So the 25-30mg has had me spaced out for like the last 12 hours or so & feeling nauseous. But it’s finally wearing off now thank God. 

That extra 5-10mg over what I normally take prior to my appointment, really made a difference. I don’t like this feeling at all. Damn my er gave me a valium at least, jesusWish I felt how U felt when on opiates Ohh I was SUPER BUGGING OUT! I couldn't breath and all the muscles in my face got super tight and was stuck in the O face looking stupid as fuck! Almost had her pull over and call 911!Nauseous or high? High, Hahaha definitely not the nausea Random question here... I only use once or twice a week max - is it normal that I can take doses of 60 to even 80mg and can tolerate it?

Is having a natural tolerance to opiates even possible? Confused as why I have such a high tolerance when I don’t use every day. 

Ps, I get blister packed oxy so I know it’s legitI believe with just like everything else, your body is used to it now. You don’t need to use everyday to develop a tolerance. Think of it like beer. Say you drink a six pack two nights a week, over time you’ll develop a tolerance and a six pack won’t really get you buzzed like it used to. There’s so many other variables as well. Health,weight,diet,
age, etc. The natural tolerance thing I’m not so sure on. I was reading something about how Ozzy Osbourne has a naturally high tolerance to drugs or something along those lines.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: AKA big ozone, Content: , ups: 687, downs: 0When u had the plug and everybody asked u to middle �‍♂️�Yo when I got my wisdom teeth out freshmen year of high school I got prescribed 20 10mgoxy/325mg acetamenofen an I sold half and felt like I was some school drug lord at that point��This made me LOL irl lmfao 

Thanks for the chuckle ��When I used to sell methadone 5s and 10s In HS... good timesthis is a quality memeThis made me cry, thank youwhen the photoshops so bad part of the original photo is still thereMy stepdad got 150 tylox back when they were still a thing. I was maybe 13. My ass would wait til they fell asleep and army crawl in their room and take like 40-50 of them. Pop 8 and have a fun night. Ahh the good ol daysLmao that’s how I felt when I started working my job a while ago there was a dude who couldn’t get anything for pain after an injury on the job except suboxone. I got him some trams and he acted like I was the plug. 

Ff to when I ran out of trams he would act all tweaky and bitch at me because I had no more. This is the funniest thing I've seen on this sub
LolBig ounce lil bitch I thought it said his name was. "Big Bounce" instead of " big Ounce" lolI have a photo with the same caption but different guy. Wonder which is the original, if either.https://i.imgur.com/lfcPB7m.jpgreal talk, even looked like him lol1QQDude when I got mine out I got a script of 5mg hydros then my mom bitched they weren’t helping so I got a script of 10mg hydros. 45 of em with two refills. I stayed loaded for a while. I got youWe've come full circle. First there was LOL ( laugh out loud), now we have to specify that we"re actually laughing out loud in real life. you can't LOL irc, it's only possible to LOL irl. Methadone is one of the few I didn’t ever try. How much does it compare to. I have the feeling it would rock someone without tolerance. Pretty damn risky. I could probably get by on 5mg every 12 hours. Ty ❤️Always a pleasureAhahahaha big sameI get 150 pills a month. How tf did he not find out? I’d probably kill someone, if they took my oxy. Thanks!Damnn that’d keep me solid for a nice 2-3 days. Solid score manYeah man 20mg any you’ll be high for a whole day maybe 2 for a beginner, not recommend for people w no tolerance for sure.Less of a rush than something like oxy or H but still pretty strong and it lasts for over 24 hours. First time you try it you’ll be strung the fuck out. doctors seem to have this idea that methadone doesn't have any recreational value, but it totally does. Takes a long time to start working but it feels like most opiates, except it lasts for a ridiculously long time.Methadone isn’t for beginners. You’d want to start at maybe 10mg. It has a nonlinear potency, that’s dependent on the dose. Fentanyl is safer to prescribe, than methadone. It's probably the most powerful opiate behind fentanyl. I take 5mg recreationally and I can feel that all day (I'm 80kg). I use it when I've got a lot of physical work because I can work like a donkey on that stuff. It's also a very economical drug, I buy it at 20p/mg. The problems are the same as any opiod, tolerance builds fast. You can't hit it every day or the dose rockets. The nice thing about methadone is that you can put it down and don't miss it. Because it's slow onset and long duration it doesn't produce the destructive impulse to take another hit and get a bit higher, like heroin for example. This is why it's useful for addicts.My mom took them as well. But he knew about that. So I just assumed he thought it was her and she thought it was him. The perfect crime lolThat many hydros in like 3 days?? Insane!Yeah the first time I took methadone I was in love. 40 mg and I was high for over 24 hours. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy made her pretty, Content: I love being high and being with you. I love the way your hair feels on my hands. I love kissing your lips. I love feeling your warmth. You dont judge me. I know you try to help me but im an addict. Girl im a fuck up.Why do you love me?

No i dont have back pain. No i didnt get it from a doctor, i got it from a dealer. Dont be afraid when i take a handful, i cant take just one baby, its called drug abuse for a reason..

I dont know. ..Are you sure you want to get high with me? This shit aint like weed. Itll knock you back and put you on your feet. Leave you grinding your teeth. And sweatin when theres no heat. Girl im a fuck up dont follow my lead.

If you miss one more class their going to drop you from your nursing program. Im not one to judge but, your tolerance is building quick. Last night you took more than me. You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Your getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

This is the fourth time i have to pick you up from a guys house. And even though were not together anymore i still tuck you in my bed when your sprung out. I make you eat so you can hide your ribs. I told you not to play with trains because they leave tracks. I watch you sleep and dry the sweat off your head even though its winter. I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone again as soon as theres light.

You use to have such a beautiful way of speaking. So intellectual, and from the heart. Deep conversations and ideas. Now im seeing foam come from your mouth. Youve only been out of the hospital for three days and you want more? Girl please stop. I love you so much. I want you to be sober again. Youre taking too much. If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , "its called drug abuse for a reason".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you. I told you i hate looking at you like this. You told me then dont look. I told you i love you. You smiled and told me, "boy im a fuck up dont follow my lead".

>When I met my boyfriend, I was making 7.25 an hour and was only able to get about 20 hours weekly. He had just lost his job due to the restaurant he worked at closing. I hardly knew him, but I was in love with him.

He would always go out randomly throughout the day. I didn’t think much of it, he would bring back food or something for us to watch. His old phone would randomly send me his location and I would always see him in random parts throughout town.

When I asked him to come pick me up, he would be hours late. I never questioned it. I was happy to have him in my life.

One day he came back to his house, where he let me rest my head and to get away from my parents. He gave me my food and went into the bathroom. He would always go to the bathroom, I assumed he got carried away on his phone, I didn’t mind, I’m just understanding his habits.

A few hours later, we are deep into a movie, we decided to pause it, make some snacks before his roommates got home so we could lock ourselves in his room, my paradise. He went to the kitchen to make food and I went to the bathroom to wash my hands.

There is it. A little dissolved pill on a spoon. When I saw it, I gasped. While not knowing exactly what it was, I knew exactly what he was doing.

I take a deep breath and walk out to the kitchen and I just stand there and look at him. Trying not to cry. Piecing things together. I just stare at him. I realized why he was in different parts of town, why he had little bruises on his arms and neck. I knew.

He finally looks up at me with a plate of food while a big smile and I watched it slowly disappear as I stare.

A single tear rolls down my face. He knew that I knew. He starts to shake. Is this the end of our relationship? We fell so hard for each other so fast, but was it the drugs that made him love me? Was it the way he was on drugs what made me love him?

I walk over to him and I just hug him. I told him I knew, and that it’s okay.

We walked back to his bedroom and he explained to me everything.

Instead of leaving him, I decided to help him. It was hard. It was really fucking hard. I remember him selling pretty much everything just to get one little pill.

One night when he took me home after work, he started to cry. He didn’t want to go home alone and didn’t have any money to buy that little pill.

I had just gotten paid. 115 dollars for a whole week. I had to pay my parents rent, I had a phone bill, and my parents dont have the same dietary restrictions like I do, and made me buy all of my food.

But i couldn’t let him suffer. Not like that. Not on a night I can’t be with him at night. I gave him every fucking dollar I had in my wallet. I hated that I gave it to him, just encouraging his addiction. Tears are pouring out of our face. He knew I made a very little amount and couldn’t bring himself to take it.

I told him it would be okay, and not to worry about paying me back until he is back on his feet.

Addiction is a horrible thing. But, if you know someone struggling. Help them out. Figure out what you can do and don’t leave them alone until you know they are okay. It does get hard. It’s not easy. There was lying, and I know he stole money. But every time I caught him, I would stop him and let him know this isn’t forever. I was there for him. I even ended up moving in with him after 3 months so I could help him out even more.

He is now almost two years clean, we are living in our own little house, both making a good amount of money, and we are so happy. Every now and then he will take me into his arms and thank me for being there for him. He ended up paying me back and is constantly spoiling me with gifts and food.

If I left him, i would have never been in love like I am now and I don’t even want to think where my boyfriend would be.

I wish my parents could understand why I left them the way I did, I really hope they can forgive me. But god damn, do I love this man.
You should really look into creative writing as a side gig. This is really well written especially if you don't have any formal education in the field. Not saying you do or don't I don't know you obviously. But if you don't and you're writing like this you should really consider it. I can see this being read as an awesome spoken word poem. I looooove it !!!! Wow this made me tear up sounds like me an my ex. hope shes doing better. only she got me smoking crack and she took up my IV dope habit. after a decade of using i finally have 7 months clean. Shes still ripping and running. I told her to go get help, I can get you a bed. "you used for a decade, I've only started!" fuck.I don’t even have words... beautiful and horrible and true in too many ways Beautiful. My fav thing I've read on here in quite a while.  I am that girl. Made me sad how much I related to this story. I hope I feel beautiful again one day. This lifestyle makes you feel ugly on the inside as well as the outside.Well fucking done.

I don't dose out props often, but this was perfect in tone and direction.

If you ever want to collab I'm up for it.I just woke up and now I'm crying.. Beautiful Damn. :(Made me cry..Holy fuck I’m crying now. I never saw it from that perspective. I’ve always been the addict.Poignant and close enough to home to feel creepy.Yoooo. That's heavy as fuck. Thanks for sharing,  I feel honored to have been able to read that. holy shit dude, holy shitAs someone said above, I am that girl. My ex introduced opiates and cocaine and all kinds of sordid substances to me 17 years ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. I do ok for awhile, then binge again. I did finish nursing school, and I'm successful in that aspect. But in all reality I'm just a functioning addict, rock bottom is just a few pills away at all times. Thank you for this, it's beautiful and tragic, and makes me look at myself a little harder in the mirror.  I liked that second line, I've been clean for a long time and I caught myself taking two of my multivitamin 'because if one is good, two is always better'. Checked the bottle and its a once daily thing. I had a similar experience. My girl killed herself in 2011 tho.This hit a very sensitive spot. It reads very true. Great job!This is eloquent. Such a beauty. Thanks for sharing. Beautiful, and I can relate so much with your girlfriend in this. My girlfriend says I used to talk passionately and intellectually about everything, and now she calls me a dribbling, lost soulYou could turn this into a song, it has the meaning. Just needs someone to believe in it.This hit me right in the feels. This is a beautiful piece of writing. Don't stop writing and stay safe my friend.Damn does it go like that too. Getting someone you care about hooked on the same shit u do, watching it spiral every second down to the ground where u burry them. FuckThat was beautiful and sad. too trueGeez. This hits at my core. It was beautiful but hard to read knowing how true it is.I love the way you write, ok there are errors a grammar nazi will find but spirit is much more important and it is there. It all rings so true and I can totally relate to it all.Damn, that was beautiful.Amazing!!!! Wow beautiful and tragicMakes me sad man and can relate too well...Very good writing, well done sirthank you for this - please keep writing :(Wonderfully said... ✌�lived thisI love this. Sounds like my girl and she's sober. That hit me hard. It was painfully beautiful to read. Thank you. Holy fuck that made me cryWow Loved itWow! Fucking spot on.  Great read. I don’t do heroin and can’t really relate at all also hate readin stories usually but I read it all this is nice What happens when your love interest is with you on your drug binges?Im at work and openly tearing up.  Thank you for this This was beautiful OP.Wow.

I really loved this...Gave me goosebumps like when you hear a song that really hits you hard.

Keep writing and sharing, you have a beautiful way with words. <3Mods please unsticky this post!!!! It is too visceral. The first time I read it I was in public and I had to fight back tears so bad. It is an amazing piece of writing, but goddamn it cuts to the fucking core of me.Man, that was a super raw and deep piece of writing. And very well done, especially the way you used certain lines of dialogue to tie the beginning and end together. Two different addicts but the same excuses, the same justifications and delusions. 

I love the way it all comes full circle. For the sake of your art though, of course... it just gives your story a poetic quality. As for having lived it though you captured your pain very eloquently, and my heart aches so bad for you. 

This I not a situation I've personally been through, but for a real minute there it felt like I have. I can't imagine.

Keep your chin up man, and keep trying to be an example for her, as for yourself. I hope for both your sakes it ends well. In the mean time though please keep writing, it's not only therapeutic but you seem to possess a gift.When I read this Susy if “I just realized I’m poetic” pap, which is really nothing more than a Neiro-mos-fire, I get embarrassed because my kid brother is just like this only about anal sex apology prose.  tl;dr?WtfSame man. A lot of memories and a lot of regrets.

Holli, if you happen to be reading this, I love you and I'm sorry. I hope you're safe and I hope you're better now. I wish things could have gone differentlyWow that was really encouraging to read.Jesus christ i cried at the part where she decided to stay with him... thats how people should befuck. I'm right there with you.  i used to hear "im young...i want to experience everything "...FUCK NO YOU DON'T I especially liked “I told you not to play with trains they leave tracks”.
But whole thing was great.Never ends well8th grade creative writing LARPsome people just CAN'T appreciate artistic or soulful things, I reckon its a result of being inbredExactly, I wish people understood this before opening the box. Once that bitch is open, there ain't no closing it.Maybe inbred, maybe just a jerk. Who really cares? Let them be a jerk, hopefully they will come around. I don’t like to abandon anyone. This is artistic to you?If you think this is artistic you are more likely to be the inbred oneit has taken me more than half my life to escape. not actively using, but you better believe i still think about it, and often daydream of my days dancing with the devil. So basically everybody that doesnt have the same view or taste like you are jerks or inbred? Looks to me like you are the real jerk hereWhy do you think this? Just throwing out insults makes you a troll. What was your view? Oh yeah-wtf.
Go fuck yourselfI dont know if ur blind or just have little self insight, but i just wrote wtf. It was you who started spitting insults like inbred and jerk etc Calm down you little emotional loser That was my point, you just wrote “wtf” but didn’t or most likely can’t say why you don’t like what OP wrote. I’m done with you now, you are a boring troll.

I've even used a needle and two glasses to be able to smoke when I didn't have papers pipes bongs vapes or even tobacco (t'was hasch)Make sure you use a cotton to filter that brah. Looks like some dirty dope sirBreak it up first it cooks better that way :)I'm concerned I know this was done for the sake of humor but it looks like the crystals and hairs on that bud are starting to singe. It stops being funny when perfectly good drugs are being damaged!BasedBOOF ITI've tried it before out of curiosity it basically just works like a vape, which I guess makes sensefrAfter reading your first sentence I didn't expect an instruction for food. I remember one thread in some forum where they used alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) to extract the stuff from the bud to IV it. It was said that it did have some effect, but it started a discussion about bioavailability and what would be better, some also throwing in that oils would maybe work etc. So yeah, smoking is probably way more efficient.I think he has 3 handswhoa calmateWelp, I know what I'm trying tonight � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: When you’re living your best life., Content: , ups: 657, downs: 0Fucking Chad with dope ass plugs and I’m the virgin cold copper God damn Chad taking all our junkie womenCoolest chad of allI have never seen this one!

Deleted and changed the text This has been posted multiple times. Maybe not the exact meme ,but same txt for sure.I will delete my post then man. Very funny.You didnt make this you lying piece of donkey shitThen someone has the same thought process as me as I wrote and created this lol. Still have my throw aways. Made this and posted it maybe about a year ago the first time. Changed the text and no here we are. 

Edit. Also only added watermark last night. That’s why previous post I’ve made of this was deleted. Whatever you say captain. Can’t say I really care about getting credit or I would of posted it on the account that are water marked. 
I reposted for fun not to try to claim credit for something that has probably been made by 20 people over the years. 

And for the tenth time just cause I wrote this does not mean someone else didn’t write the exact same thing and or similar ones. But I made this and posted over a year ago, still does not mean someone else didn’t make or use the same thing. Google i've been sober for 40 days meme. Or ive been sober not in a row meme.There a ton, but ok. Of course it’s been reposted, but also not saying another person or multiple people didn’t make the exact same meme, most generic sentence to come out with that but can confirm I’ve made and posted (and other varieties not just drugs)this all over for years and on here over a year or so.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: one year down!, Content: , ups: 653, downs: 043k SHIT son, if that aint a reason i don't know what is (except ur health and wellbeing)

congratulations =)Congrats my dude ❤️️ Proud of u !!!

Almost 6 months for me, it's been tough af but I'm doing it somehowit glows in the dark, so you don't have to

..whatever the fuck that meansIt feels weird just experimenting with a drug for the first time when you know it will get out of hand in the future, and you will have a hard time stoppingCongrats dude. I remember what an important day my 1 year was.

I’m coming up on 3 years now (on may 8) and I found that I hit a pretty tough hump at 18 months but you can power through it.

Instead of getting high for the past 3 years, I bought a new car and a house. Before I used to have no money and now I don’t even live paycheck to paycheck. So happy for you!Awesome work. I'm only on day 81 clean off H, but one day I hope to hit that one year mark too like you. Congratulations. Huge accomplishment, such an inspiration!Congrats bro! Just hit my 9 months, keep going strong!!Wow, $43k saved! Do you feel that much richer? Or were you getting most of the money from a 'hustle'.What is this app?

Also, congrats!!!!! Im proud of you, stranger!Lol 40k saved cheersThat’s so amazing!!!! Congrats on saving ur money, ur wellbeing, and I guess living a healthier life!!!! Congratulations!  Keep it up, much love! �So you make that much momey to be able to spend 120 every day on dope? Not saying it's impossible but you'd have to make well over 100k a year if you are independentMajor bro. Cheers x What app is this? Congratulations by the way! Damn I should be there with you. My year would have been this Friday. But I relapsed about a month ago. ��☠Hell yes!  Congratulations!!!!Holy shit that’s a lot of money saved!! Not to mention your life, as well. LSweet ����[deleted]Well done man. Keep it up Wow you're a fucking beast and an inspiration!!
oh well aren't you just mister purrrrrfffecctYeah imagine all the dope you could buy with 43K!




In all seriousness though, congrats OP hope you make that 1 into a 10!I hate to sound so cliché, but, it gets better! I'm not saying it's a breeze but it's easier now than it was at the 6 month mark for sure.  Hang in there bro.

edit: spelling[deleted]I always thought it was like lighting a pipe in the dark. Picture someone in an abando app you see is the glow from their lighterGet out while you can..Yeah, that’s more flirting with ruin than just experimenting.  You experiment with weed, acid, molly, shrooms, etc.  You get hooked with opes.

Rare people (VERY rare) do em occasionally and that’s all.  

Most get hooked, and there’s the 95% recidivism rate.  Shit even I know I could do better, I count it as 5 years because that’s when I got off the needle, but I’ve been tempted by pills from time to time.   I ultimately end up regretting it because once you’ve been there, tolerance and WD’s come in a matter of weeks.   That’s kept me alright.   I feel I’m lucky I’ve managed that though, and many don’t.

So yeah, listen to the other guy.  There’s no un-experiencing all the different opes.  And your body will never forget that chemical.   I think I’d trade back to never having experienced them, as then I’d be content always with the ups and downs of life.

And congrats to the OP.  One year means you’re a lot more likely to be successful, especially if you’re not on maintenance.  Not knocking that, but let’s face it, ppl on methadone aren’t really clean, they’ve just admitted defeat and settled.  Depressing shit. In my experience, the two hardest periods when getting off opiates is obviously the first 7 days, and then day 30-90. The latter is where you have to constantly fight off your mind trying to deceive you that you can do it again. Of course that doesn’t stop after 90 days, but I remember feeling like I was constantly hanging on by a thread for the first 3 months.

81 days is something to be proud of man, seriously. Keep fighting the good fight.81 days is amazing! Just keep doing what works. what app is that?Also, the amount of money saved is insane!Easy i used to spend 200 a day i was the junkie that makes people think twice about giving up $ first. Once u run outta people to burn u steal. Scheme anything for that fix.. if i had 400 id spend it may last 2 days but id buy 2 bricks at a time but quality wasnt great so doing 7-10 bag shots 6-7 times a day.. $$$ adds up Fast. Me and my boy calculated one day we figured dope gas and smokes we would need atleast 175 10 for gas 2 packs of smokes 150.for a brick. Towards the end we had a new guy who did bricks for 130. Or we could get fire fire shit for 90 a bundle but still needed 3 bags each foe that... but it didnt matter. We figured we spent 25000 on gas smokes n dope in 3 months..120 isnt that much tbh.... Its 30 a point in canada all the way up too Thanks buddy. It's called 'nomo sobriety clock'Remeber relapsing is okay! It's not the goal but never beat yourself up for it. you are human. We fuck up, alot, we are great at it. But you are still doing great and the next clean run will hopefully be even longer :) 
Keep at it and never give up! While humans fuck up we are also incredibly resilient and powerful beings when we need to be. 
Best of luck to you friend. Relapse is part of the road.  You didn’t lose your year, and thinking like that will continue rather than correct a mistake.  Just pick up, continue.  Subtract whatever run time you had and keep counting.  I don’t think anyone would ever give you shit directly at NA/AA, but if they did, ypu’d just tell em to fuck off and it’s your progress not theirs.

I think the mental thing of going to get the 24h chip etc. is retarded.  Stigmatizes it in a community built around the fact that it happens, making it like the walk of shame.  I don’t like 12 step, you may not either, but for those that do I feel like that is just a deterrant.  A good sponsor, imo, would give a year chip once cleaned up and the time was made up.  That’s what counts.  Keep moving, fuck up less and less over time.  If someone says they’ve never relapsed, they’re either 1 in a million or they’re lying.He's obviously not perfect. He's done heroin. But I even as a user that has no immediate plans to stop can appreciate and congratulate someone who does want to quit and takes the steps & fights the tough battle involved with abstaining from H. You can be happy for yourself and not post something like this but personally, I think showing other people who don't think it's possible, or those who are trying and feel like they won't be able to make it that far, is a great boost of confidence that may help someone else keep up their fight or get their head back into the game when they were so close to falling off the sober train. 

To OP: Grats dude. Keep up the good work. I’m guessing enough to last you 365 days lol 8 days for me! I'm hanging in there, I'm actually doing much better than I expected at this point.> it gets better

You’re not lying that’s a fact. ahhh.    lol all these meetings have different sayings.Thank you very much, made my day man. Thanks!NomoCongrats tho man. Are you on a maintenance like sub/ methadone? Or the shot? Or just 100% finally freeDamn 300 a gram?Would it also work for other categories (gaming, binging, gambling) or is it really specific for drugs?Thank you, yes, exactly the right message.i was just fucking aroundOh man. Late reply. But that made me laugh :pthats fucking awesome man, keep going

it really does get easier as you go. subs help immensely as well

wishing you the best of luck my friend <3

Definitely be proud, you made most of that key first 3 months.  Just remember the “pink cloud” effect and all, and be prepared that you might have an increase in depression or lethargy etc. as that initial happiness with being free wears off.  That’s the stage where boredom can hit and you can have the very wrong thought that hey it’s been a while, so why not enjoy a little but with the newly lowered tolerance.  Fighting that is a day at a time as they say.  But certainly a year is a big statistical milestone for long-term success, and understanding brain chemistry, you do better the longer it’s had to recover.

Gotta remember my own advice next time I’m at temptedNot to be confused with the nohomo appYup... The canadian police think a gram of H is worth 1000.. Last bust said street value was 1000... But its good dope too.. Brownstone Gotta lol at the question that would easily be answered a lot quicker by just looking up the name he gave you.

I’ll answer anyway though.  An addiction is an addiction, if you’re trying to cut something out, I see no reason why not use it, given you can name the vice.  I’m not even sure what about the app would possibly be so drug specific that very comparable addictions like gambling wouldn’t work just the same.

tldr; Well, yeah..Well it is the internet so technically that's to be expected but ya never really know who is or isn't so I felt the need to share. Maybe my comment will help someone else who really does feel that way. Cheers. �Thanks man I appreciate the good vibes . ~~~Lol they really said that? Police always look like such idiots when they say they found a half ounce of pot with a street value if 2 million dollars!Mainly because it says how much money you saved You could certainly quantify a loss for anything you mentioned.  Gambling is the most obvious, but either of the others causes a big loss of time.  One could value their time really however they’d like, although the most meaningful would be to correlate it to work (so hours saved not doing something multiplied by what you make, if on salary or self employed you’d just have to figure that out by doing the math versus someone paid hourly it’s pretty easy), so if i did less of whatever and more work, I’d make money.  Or it costs because your girlfriend gets pissed if you game all day, and eventually you get her stuff to make her less mad. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Whichever mod added the cute little "floating text" blurbs when you upvote a post..., Content: Maybe they've been there for a while now and I just never noticed, but...

that upvote button[deleted].Let it be known here that I have stated: the mods of this sub are the best in the business and with the level of experience and excellence with which they wield their long arms of Justice they fulfill the promises of generations of rule enforcement officials that guide our modern realities!!!Does this work for reddit's new design? I haven't seen this.Just a reminder: onhover/onmouseover is a computer-only event. (for the buttons). Doesn't work on mobile.How did you learn to code for Reddit?

Is there a simple way to add custom JavaScript and images when you're a mod?Can we change the "I feel the love" to "I feel the klove?" Everything is better prefixed with a k, afterall. (One of the random messages upon ~~upvoting~~ smashing the like button)[deleted]does it work on mobile? I tried upvoting to see what would pop up but nothing didHahaha just got on the desktop site and hats off to you guys. Cracked me up 10/10just dont overdo itYo dawg I heard you like subs, so we'll give you subs while you take subs while you're already high on dope so you go into precipitated withdrawal./u/KickerS12X is the man!

Also  dont forget to not wreck yourself[SMASH THAT KLIKE KBUTTON](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7frn19/smash_that_like_button/)I stay busy as fuck with all the knuckleheads around here for sure!If you are on chrome you can click the three dots in the top right corner and hit 'request desktop site' and it will bring up the version we are seeing.lest we forget  :(just read this after I posted my questionIt's all CSS.

[Great resource.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)SSSMMMMAAAASSSSHHHHHHH*tips fedora*....M'lady\*does a curtsey\*Nope! Mobile app's don't support CSS changes.Too late. LOLLLLI probably need some subs :( I've lost control.fu fu fu fu fu fuck a case lil tayk did the raceWhen did you get back?I wish they showed up on the mobile app ��Thank you :-).Hehehehehehe <3.Mobile doesn't support the :hover css special. BUT, for anchor's ( the <a> tag, which the submit buttons are) there is a special property "active" which will occur after they click the button.

So you should be able to copy the :hover rule and change hover to :active, and folks on mobile will get the same effect after clicking the link. Since mobile is slower, they will see that yellow bar for probably a few seconds before the next page loads. � 

Let me know if this is unclear, if you're interested I can help you with specifics in PM.And clearly lost the race lolAbout a week ago as a mod, got out the joint about a month ago.Click on the 3 dots in the top right and select 'request desktop site'It works on the mobile browser, but not the apps.Oh, neat. I'm glad to hear it, though I thought you were being put away for years?Thanks. Good lookin’ out for when I’m bored and on the mobile app lol

Edit: ahh I know what you’re referring to but that option isn’t avail via the iPhone* app. I should’ve specified. How does a hover work if there's no mouse?I did 2.5 the first time and 2 the second time.No, you misheard him.

He wasn't put *away* for *years*,

He was putting *whey* in his *ears*.Err, I meant the floaty upvoties. I will take a look at the submit buttons.Yeah, I'm saying for the submit buttons you can take the code that's like 

.morelink:hover a

and copy it into a new stanza directly below that reads

He's on another planet., Content: , ups: 650, downs: 0This is possible the best thing I have ever seen. Tell that doggo to SIT!
NOD!

Good boy.That's one doped up doggo!!I would’ve thought it’d have an opposite effect on his eyes. Them shits are wiiiide tf open lolYou guys, you guys, where's... the sour patch kids?It's when he wants to be let out to cold-cop that you need to start worrying. Saw this on another sub and thought it belongs here. Lol, I probably looked the same way the first time I injected morphine and got hit with the pins and needles! HAHAHA god i gotta post a video. My kitten was getting neutered, and he's pretty aggressive so they had me give him this sedative it was absolutely hilarious. It was like he was hammered. 

He also got ket at the vet, and I was pissed they didn't give him a baggie to bring home. i mean come on! he needs it! 

lol really tho, he was rolling around on the floor he was so zooted afterwards. Lmao! Is that a boarder collie? Dogs with that color of eyes always look neurotic haha but this is next level."Hey man, wanna buy some dog morphine?"

"Woof."Disturbing. I think they gave him Molly.can you please tell that dog that it's a good boy. I'm hope he doesn't have anything serious and that he can enjoy this and be ok.Pupils are pinned the fuck out lol[deleted]Interesting thing. When I worked at a vets office, when the animals would come out of the anesthesia, they would open their eyes really wide like this doggo. It was so funny! 

I recently took my cat in because she had hurt her leg. They gave her a script of liquid morphine and she would go to sleep, then wake up and do the huge eyeball thing. H I G H B O Y EDaaaaaamn that looks like an upper with those dilated pupils not morphine! Regardless, your dog is flying! LolHa, that dog is lit! That dog got better medical treatment then most humans do nowadays, lucky bastardLooks like Fido is rolling balls Sniffed or IV?That’s the best thing I ever saw!!!
-Fry��awhhh!!D O P E B O Y EHahahahah I just laughed out loud at this for like two minutes straight, thanks I wonder how dogs get when they go into opiate withdrawal. Do they pawn all their Scooby snacks? Just so everyone knows this dog took shrooms in the woods with its owner. You can YouTube it to fact check.Ah, a fellow creature having a grand old time having his/her mu receptors tickled.  

As humans, we need to get over ourselves -- just because we have couple more brain cells doesn't mean there's any fundamental difference between how our brain works vs., say, a squirrel's. Poor dude was hugging the wall so he wouldn't fall off the earth lmaoOmg love it!!! He looks like he's on acid or something tho lolRight? I can't help but giggle every time I see this. LolSame, it hurts too laugh!Yep.

Looks like doggo got an addy or a tiny bump of meth or something.dogs usually have bigger pupils though so maybe you can see more of his colored iris because his pupil is pinned compared to what it usually isWhen I first started with opiates they’d give me that lil boost of energy and chattiness, and they never made me nod out or get sleepy until like several hours after my dose. Maybe that’s what the puppy is feeling. And I’m jealous as shit, I much prefer the energy to the nodding but it stopped having that effect pretty quickHahaha, I just imagined the dog sitting at the door itching, or prentending to get hurt to go back to the vet to see the plug!ohh those pins and needles. never shot morphine but I've had some ecp that still had some morphine in it and gave me those pins and needles. fairly unpleasant the first time but I grew to appreciate it - it was decent stuff.OMG, you should definitely post it. 

& Ket is one thing I've never gotten a chance to do. It's on my bucket list though I think it is. And I know, right? That look on his face cracks me up every time I see it!Its an Australian Shepard, I have 2 of them. The native Americans used to call them ghost eyes.CATS ARE THE BEST YOU KNOW?! I FUCKING LOVE CATS..AND SQUIRRELS AND THE MAILMAN. THE MAILMAN IS SO FUCKING COOL AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MOLLY I SWEAR! I WISH HE WAS HERE SO I COULD HUG HIM AND JUMP ON HIM AND...AND...WHERE DID MY WATER BOWL GO? I'M REALLY THIRSTY. CAN YOU PET MY BELLY OMG THAT WOULD FEEL SO GOOD MAN THIS IS GOOD SHIT. Those pupils though. It's definitely an opiate. MDMA dilates pupils.According to the OP who took the video the doggo stepped on a nail and had to have surgery for it. Doggo is totally okay though apparently.I'm clean but I haven't unsubbed, and don't plan to. I love this place. I don't really go out of my way to look at the dope porn though lol. I mean I see the pics in my feed but I don't really open themI noticed the same thing when my cat got neutered. I wonder why that is?Haha, I did too when I saw it! Glad I could brighten your day! :)Hahaha, we've all been there :)He looks like he's already clucking!!! ....  Jesuz! Like the wheels are turning on whether it's worth snatching yr phone and being homeless! ffsVet was like

"ay to I'm gonna toss in a free point of this ice it's a new connect. Hmu if you need anything"Dogs obviously have some kind of consciousness, so I'm really curious what he's thinking / feeling (esp. since there's no way they could understand what drugs are).. like they def get anxiety and whatnot so I wonder if he's thinking "I have no idea what's going on but this is how I always wanna feel" .. in dogspeak tho � Same. But personally I love nodding. After a couple years of doing drugs all the time, and the health/lifestyle changes that come along with that, it's lovely to have a substance that'll just put me to sleep comfortably and isn't a benzo. If I need to feel chatty I have other options (coke, Phenibut, etc). If you have an oxycontin prescription and you stick rigidly to the prescription amount and eat the pills like you're supposed to then you get the energy/chatiness every time you take your dose, so every 12 hours.It freaked me out pretty bad each time. Idk I don't find the rush too pleasant either. But I also learned to appreciate itIt's definitely interesting. Dxm is very similar except won't put you in a temporary trippy coma like ket can. This is too real [deleted]Good question. I wonder if it’s a thing where they feel threatened and they are really trying hard to stay alert. “Dogspeak” fucking lel "Bark Bark Bark" "what's that girl? Lil Jimmy is trapped in the well?" (In dogs thoughts) no you ass hole just gimme some drugs. DXM is like Ketamine mixed with a lil schizophrenia imoRight, I totally understand that.  I'm on vivitrol so luckily I don't have awful cravings for dope, so the pics don't bother me really. But if I sit there and stare at them and romanticize using, it can get bad quick.

You just described Switzerland’s heroin clinics So basically Laos? You can live on $500/month dope included indefinitely there.If there's even a hell of such kind, I'm in!I’ll pop a xan and snort a line of China to that!!C'mere, brother!

*somewhere, a Jimmy Buffet fan gets their wings*Wouldn’t shock me. Also, birds get drunk on fruit. One time we saw them feasting at school, and they were flaying into the walls. Because with pot, you only need one plant. An acre of poppies yields 7-13lb of raw opium. So realistically, you'd plant maybe a 1/16 or 1/32 of an acre ?? Which would yield 11 or 22 ounces on he high end of cultivation yield. Just isn't worth the work. And thats before an attempt to acetylate it. Heroin has a 6-10% yield from the original weight of the raw opium. Which gives you 1-2oz of heroin, per 16th/32nd of an acre of poppies.You can buy them online with a simple google search. It's not illegal to grow opium poppies its illegal to use the goo.

I would say coca is much less common because it's a tropical plant. I had one while living in Costa Rica. It's fun to chew the leaves.You can buy seeds anywhere I’m growing some right now and poppy plants doesn’t transplant well at all both of them would takes many acres of the plants to make into a yearly supply for an addict. still, lots still do just thisr/druggardeningI believe the Coca genus is a tropical one so probably no luck in the US maybe southern Florida, Puerto Rico or USVI if you can manipulate growing conditions.

P. Somniferum is grown in backyards throughout the US. If you know what it looks like you will see it eventually.  Ive seen it grown in public parks for aesthetics although that was pre 2005.  The alkaloid content varies drastically though.  If you can get a high alkaloid producing strain you could increase output significantly.

As mentioned below it transplants poorly but can be done when the plants are very small but this will limit yield and oftentimes kill the plant. Sow seeds in late fall or early spring.  The seeds seem to need a period of cold to reach full potential.  Also you need quite a large area and lots of time and labor if you want anything more than a small personal amount.Don’t think you read the article at all lmao I laughed so hard seeing the little guy fly away with a whole pod and all the destroyed pods that were like half gone. Birds are such a trip man I love them. Be only good for 3 months or so, unless they have access to greenhouses!  Perhaps they stash pods somewhere?True but this article is actually great Sounds like you meant to post on whisper.Tedious and gross? What kind of sex are you having?Thinking of a dopesick parrot makes me sad :( 

At least they don’t have to have a bunch a hustles or have to pawn their mom’s jewelry to cop a fix Except you can't use as much as you want, can't take it home, can't have a job as you show up at the clinic a couple of times a day.... Nah the hell of that is you've got loads of money and the dudes phone always goes to voicemail, but on the chance you finally score its either bunk or just cut to shit with sugar. I mean, if I were to have a lil field of poppy plants then I’d say fuck refining it. Jus cook down the raw opium and smoke the opium. No, it doesn’t hit you like a shot but smoking opium will lay you out like any other. I personally love it. Wish I still had a source tbhIsn’t it a a very specific kind of poppy and it requires very specific conditions to grow ? 

I always liked poppies bc they are so punk rock. Like if you pick them they just fall apart and are like “haha. I’d rather die than get plucked and put in a vase bitch” If your growing personal amounts of opi you wouldn't need that many plants, but cocoa yeah you'd need a field at least because it's like 1% cocaine or somewhere roughly around there yeah... they're cool, but i get really frustrated with them in my veggie garden... they will eat every seed i throw down unless i put bird netting on all my beds (which i've done)!Just standard hetero sex. I just scroll through sex ads looking for drugs and I think “what is with these people? Drugs are way better.” To each their own I guessFr wtf I can understand liking drugs more but not actually disliking sex tf especially for a guy Thinking of dopesick people makes me more sadYour right, they  just gotta watchout for the Afghan with the shotgun.

When you compare their lives thinking in terms of consequences of getting burned based on ease of acquiring the dope I still think id be okay being a parrotOpium, albeit not as potent as most other opiates, imo is the best one you can do I first smoked opium back when I was sixteen and it was one of the best highs I’ve ever had ;)Yes, only papaver somniferum can be used to produce opium. Other kinds of poppy are just decorative. For example, in Germany (and I reckon the rest of Europe) the seeds of that kind are used for cooking and baking but are rigorously cleaned from any trace amount of opiate alkaloids after there have been some involuntary intoxications. Idk if you can use those seeds to plant poppys. But I know that if you order seeds that are meant for planting you can get in trouble w the law as a license is needed for growing that specific kind of poppy. Nope, and not really. They’re god damned weeds haha it doesnt take many plants to get high ONCE. were talking a yearly supply for a heroin addict lolI see your point here, but if the coca bush gets 10 ft high and the leaves contain around 0.5% cocaine.  Poppy straw is about the same when harvested about a 0.5% yield (different than extracting latex).  So the same yield from plant matter but im guessing a significantly greater yield per unit area because you are going to have significantly more weight on a 10ft high coca bush that is taking up 16 sqft of growing space than you will poppy straw in 16 sqft of growing space.  I have no real experiece with this it just seems logical but someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Thinking of Omar from the Wire makes me more sad. Best show ever. YerrrBecause opium has been found to have at least traces of all the good shit. Even hydro and oxy morphone So fresh and so clean But he's right, only papaver somniferum contains the good alkaloids. All the other kinds of poppys only look pretty but won't get you high. Fun fact: there were some poppys growing on the premises of the first hospital I detoxed in. But I don't know what kind as the pods haven't flowered yet by that time. For someone with that high of a tolerance yeah I'd def agree lol. That's why I stopped all my current opioid use ��I'd definitly say your spot on with that analysis, so over all it's more realistic to grow some poppies for slight personal use as opposed to cocoa for the samePoppies can be harvested multiple times though because all you need is the latex which is actually very high morphine content. You don’t need to kill the plant to harvest so the same plant can give you more again later down the road. I’ve known kids in high school that found some in someone’s garden and took the latex from a few and put it on top of a small bowl of chronic and smoked it to get high. They had zero opiate tolerance but still it’s possible to get something from a few plants, but the process of turning it into heroin means you will be getting less than the weight of the latex obviously. He'll yeah man, I tried it at a music festival last summer (after already having been addicted to every opiate under the sun in my life) and holy fuck dude, that shit is amazing It really is. It’s all the best shit rolled into one beautiful smoke seshI haven’t stumbled upon actual opium in years, but I have fond memories of it for sure. I love the smell of the smoke too. It’s very distinct I used to be good friends with a dude that owned a gas station in my town. He was Indian and would take frequent trips to him home country. He’d always being me back a 10 pack of biddie’s. Idk if I’m spelling it right. They’re joints that have been rubbed tf down with opium. Smoke one of those bad bois and your dick is in the dirt. Good memories @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I guess I remember having friends like this, Content: , ups: 635, downs: 0here's some really complex amusement though. take a long weekend by yourself, go out of your house friday morning and don't come back til monday night. the goal is to get as far (geographically) from the start point and get by with nothing in your pockets or your system. that shit is real fucking hard but when you get back home it's sublime. So true. People always so excited to get off work and drink a beer. And i just sit there wondering how does that get people excited. Give me some oxy and xanax and dope and then add some alchohol to intensify the effects then it sounds exciting! I wish i got excited over a stinkin beer� once u do opiods or oxy ext. Everything else  that used to be fun turns boring lol. Fuck it. Time to blow a 30 ;)[removed]Yes he was. I'm old enough to have seen Nirvana on MTV live. RIP Kurt. Hope he finally got that peace he was so desperately looking for.It is fucking pain. I remember the time when I didn't thought of opiates everytime I am slightly bored. Fuck, the worst part of taking drugs is that the normal life gets boring.This relates to me but not how you might think.  I ran the fun out of heroin and am now sober. This is more like “everyone is going out to drink but I can’t because I’ve got to be sober now”He had a vicious heroin addiction. That could explain why he was no longer passionate about music. When you go off opiates music sounds good for some reason. At least until horrible depression kicks inWhen I get offered a drink I usually turn it down while thinking of all the negatives that come with it. Yet I can't think of one negative when I am offered a pill or bag. Only after can I think I of one.On stims as well, good man Lol nice meme. Facto I was so high this morn/night I stood in front of my toilet for what seemed like hours before the damn finally let lose. RIP TO A LEGEND his scandalous girl made it a cover upI’d most likely get real high before leaving Friday morning and commit to driving 4+ hours away, saying to myself the farther I am the better ... and once I reach my destination I’ll get by ok I’m sure. Until I start to experience restless legs 13hrs in and I’ll hit up homeboy, speeding back home to meet him and pick up. And it’d be barely half a day as I get high again. And repeat. Spoken like someone who has never been thru actual opiate withdrawal. 

Have fun walking around your neighborhood disoriented as fuck switching from bus to train to bus to train, pan handling or turning yourself out or stealing shit and pawning it so you can afford a candy bar and a bottle of water that you don’t want but have to choke down so you don’t die of malnutrition or water loss from all the puking and diarrhea. 

Once you’ve managed to somehow mooch six or seven bucks to get something to eat, you’ll go in the restaurant covered in the spit of the “respectable” and smelling like you’d just ran a marathon. BO is so unbearable that you’ll offend everyone in your general vicinity. Everyone will give you dirty looks and your clothes will be ruined. At this point you’ll be far as fuck from your house, having snuck onto a few buses or trains to accomplish your goal of getting as geographically far as possible from your home. 

By the time you’ve convinced enough people to give you enough quarters and dimes to afford a couple of McChickens and a Big Gulp, your weekend will be over. Maybe you’ll get “lucky” and someone will give you money or drugs for sex (sex that may or may not be according to your preference/orientation, ie gay for pay or straight for pay) or you’ll steal something, but those two things probably won’t happen because withdrawal makes you look smell and act like a freak and a lot of ppl won’t want to get near you.

You’ll be lost, shaking like a damn leaf, exhausted from not sleeping for a whole weekend which you spent either outdoors or on public transit, horrible restless legs you’ll have to pound on with your fists to calm down, drenched in sweat to the point that your clothes feel like a wetsuit like you’re going surfing except it’s sweat and not ocean water, and if you did manage to score some dope while you were out with jack shit for money or drugs in your pockets however you might do it, then you either have to shoot up outdoors in a stairwell or in some public bathroom with a needle that couldn’t possibly be sterile because you’ve been outside for over 24 hours and everything to do with you including your skin is covered in germs by this point.

If that idea, taking a long ass trip to nowhere with no money or dope, sounds fun to you, you are not addicted to opiates yet and you should stop fucking with them now. Like right now. Everyone thinks they can handle joy popping until they can’t anymore. Nobody decides to get addicted to Heroin.

That sounds like hell on earth to me, and I’m pretty sure a lot of people who are homeless just live this lifestyle all the time. It sounds like you’re describing a weekend of abject poverty as a drifter. Like I said, if that sounds fun or complex or entertaining to you, you are not a junkie yet. A real junkie would be terrified of doing that and would probably avoid such an endeavor at significant cost, including stealing from family, friends, or allowing disgusting people to take sexual advantage of them.So true, I remember the days when I was excited to get off work and smoke some pot. Now I get excited to smoke some tar when I get off work or eat some oxy.heroin iv was my first opiate, i quit after 2 years and now i'm happy to smoke weed and that's it. just because you can't doesn't mean it's boring. i've had oxy too and compared to heroin, now that is boring.same position in a way in relation to alcohol. i still love smoking weed though. Shit, i remember when that sounded exciting. Nowadays, unless theres a spoon and rig involved  i feel like my time is being wasted, even with opiates.Right. I be smoking and sniffing h at work, excited to go home and do enough to Really nod, yes give me the booze but give me the dope on top of it tooo��Poor cobain :(so spot on, how normalcy (or sobriety) starts to feel boring after a period of time. god how i wish i could just un-try opiates, benzos, meth and basically any thing ive ever been addicted to. i mean ive even been addicted to removing  blackheads and stuff like exercise, i really do get addicted to fucking just anything its so dumb and a pain in the assI’m actually clean now too, I just thought this was funny. Honestly I consistently have more fun in recovery though the highs are not nearly as high the lows aren’t soul crushing anymore. In any case congrats on your recovery!you rly think he was murdered? don't get in a car that defeats the point, then you're just driving aimlessly away from your house like a loony. test your ability to survive at the bare minimumtHanKs fOr thE frIeNdly aDviCe pRoFesSoRSo perfectly said ��Damn you also forgot the part where not only do other people not want to have sex with you, you also don't want to have sex with anyone, let alone touch anyone, cause it hella fucks with your sex drive...Lil over the top there budId rather blow soke oxy than eat it but hey enjoy how you enjoyfor me it was dxm, never really liked weed but dxm was one of those things for me, i could just do it sometimes and i was fine being sober the rest of the time. i mean i was still chronically depressed as i have been my whole life but it wasnt particularly painful to be sober... now its extremely painful when the opiates/benzos wear off[deleted]I see what u mean makes sinceAlchohol doesnt even make you feel good in comparison to perks/roxis/opiates. It feels good when you drink a small amout of alchohol to intensify the opiates in me�☠�..anythijg to make it stronger. I sprinkle fentanyl on my mcdonalds fries  for funhe was def murderedThis would make sense of you lives at least 20-30km into the woods with no one around. I certainly did! I forgot to mention that any sex you will be having will be entirely non consensual but, paradoxically, you will be desperate to have it because you need money for a fix. There is no worse feeling than being desperate to find someone to buy your consent/pay to rape you so you can stop feeling horrible. That’s basically what low end prostitution is, I’m not trying to be judgmental of it, I was a gigolo myself for quite some time. It’s just hard. Being a high class escort is fun (sort of...), but if you’re just desperate and looking for any way to get money that you can from any one, being a hooker is a living hell disguised as a party. It’s very sad. 

The thought of even kissing someone whilst in withdrawal is absolutely sickening. The act is even worse and it just goes downhill the further you get around the baseball field. 

I personally have gone all the way in order to obtain money for a fix a couple of times (sorry if that’s TMI it probably is) and had to hide my symptoms and pretend to enjoy myself. I even cheated on a monogamous partner for money one time because I was so desperate. They (janes n johns) had to know, they had to...anyone who is willing to go all the way through paid sex with someone who is obviously withdrawing without at least helping them fix first is probably a sick disgusting fuck, just saying. If I were the type of guy that paid for sex and a hooker came to my house shaking and dirty and sweating and crying in withdrawals I’d just give her the money, let her shower, and tell her to go fix up. 

Or him, whatever your preference is, not tryna be politically incorrect just illustrating a point. If I had opiates I’d hand them over for free. People who dangle addictive substances in front of people as a way of manipulating them into having sex are literally some of the scariest types of people on the planet.UhuhyuhbruhI snort a abundance of them too lol.i always wanted to try, when i no longer wanted to live i went for itlmao dude what the hell are you even saying. you sprinkle “fentynal” on your mcdonald’s fries for fun? that’s a joke, right?Why are you being downvoted?What basis. Just legit curious. works either way, try itDont call em oxymonster for no reason nowNa im desd swrious. Fuck salt fentanyl goes way better on the fries and kills you faster than all the other GMOs in it. You thinking i was joking, was a joke right? Wtf. Be real kiddo.. I guess alchys are having a different opinion.  And I don't even know what being up voted ann down voted means Fill me inThere's literally decades of discussion on this topic. It may be difficult to summarize in a reddit comment.can you tell us about how it went when you tried it? you are physically addicted to opiates, right?downvoted means that basically, people dislike what youre saying. generally speaking, upvotes and downvotes have little relation to the actual quality of whatever comment you mad, as ive experienced thru out my 2+ years on herenah i just like to get high, in some ways more than others. 
but the first time i did it, i drove out to the woods and thankfully it didnt rain that weekend because i was basically sleeping on the heavily wooded section of road shoulder, basically four days in a row. food was a bitch the first time, i went out on a really full stomach but by the end of saturday i was mega hungry and had to find the nearest mini mart and made a retarded deal where i got a guy to give me money for a future venmo. thanks to that man, he was nice. the two subsequent times ive panhandled very successfully even in really really small towns in FL. 
but its what it sounds like, a lot of walking around lookin at stuff, talking to yourself, deep introspection, being homeless for four days. its not entirely fun but its wholly rewarding to know i can survive for a few days on, and this is just me, America's fat of the land. wear dri-fit and the requisite socks/shoes for hiking because your feet will hurt, but you can mitigate it to a degree. 
i have to say this is not for everyone, and depending on where you are, you can get hurt or lost, so for the first time take more provisions then continually scale down. bruh u wildLmao @@@@@@@@@@ Title: So glad im done with that life lmao, Content: , ups: 633, downs: 0My hustle was always shoplifting. Best way to get  money IMO, besides a job.I usually sell shit to get shit Knew a guy that sucked dick back in 2006 or so. Nobody really KNEW him, but he lived close and always came around. If someone’s phone rang and he realized it was a dude he’d always ‘joke’ “ask if he wants a dick suck!” Dude always had all the OC80s. Way more than he could use. It’s all coming together now. He looks like a happy old man. Smiling as the sun hits his bright red cheeks, strolling through his opium field, counting the yield- About to sit on his porch and have a nice cold glass of sweet tea. � 

GET OFFA MAH PROPERTY YA SONS O’ BITCHES. I've always worked and had hustles. Only they weren't everyday hustles just for drugs. A lot of drugs were bought because we got fucking paid. To be young again...



Our main thing was hitting freight trains. We had an inside connection to tell us where big ticket items were. I'm talking everything from gold jewelry,watches,laptops. Fucking everything! It was so fun to because of the team effort and the money. Looking back it really blows my mind that we  were never caught. I'm sure it was millions that we blew. My aunt still uses the bread maker that I gave her 15 years ago. I might have sold it to her actually. Do it right and be safe.I use nearly 500g of kratom and 5-10g of cbd bud thats a good 130$ a month. Dont know how to finance thatIt's a dirty job but someone gotta do it!20-30$ a day hereThis is greatThen what? Sell the items?[deleted]cool?$100/day is super commonthe word of the day is JOBYou can make 130 bucks in a day flying a sign by the freeway. Can't tell if you are being sarcastic or are just extremely lazy and thick in the head. Pfft, that's cheap af. Alot of Ppl spend 3x that in a day easily on opiates of some sort.You could easily get a part time job working 1 day a week for 5 hours and would prob have little $ left over. But if the goal is not working then  you could collect cans and return them for .05 deposit. Depending on where u live collecting 86 cans a day shouldnt be hard. Just find out the trash collection schedule and hit that neighborhoods recycle bins early morning. Being able to come up with less then $5 a day should be easy.Just plant some poppies as shown in that photo...Thats cute try $250 a dayWeird flex but okYou could work Who gives a shit?$40-$50 a day here. Down from $75 a day. Down from $125-$250 a day. With plans to move down to $20-$25 a day in the coming month or so. But I work. To fund my use. No hustles or dishonest work here. Sell or consume items. I’d steal food from gas stations for myself because gas station attendants DGAF. Steal from big box stores for your drugs. Best advice is if you’re lifting from a dept. store or bigger ticket items, have atleast one other person with you to create distraction if shit goes south. That or find someone to return the items for a gift card and then sell said gift card. When I was a junkie I had a Mexican fencer who bought everything at about 80percent of its value. Big ticket shit is vitamins and OTC supplements, 501 jeans, and those big boxes of detergent. Yup, depending on what you're stealing, you could sell it to bodegas and whatnot. >Steal items
>post a ad online
>profitsince when and why are shipments getting siezed?Where the hell pays that much to wave a sign?

Edit: ohhhh you mean pan handling I thought you meant waving a sign for a business my bSeriously. I’ve never had to do it fortunately, but I had plenty of ermm let’s call them business associates who did. They could scratch up 100$ in an hour at the right high volume areas saying the right thing. Doubly easy if you’re an attractive female and are good at selling a believable story (holding a gas canister, forgot purse at home, car ran out of gas at XYZ, acting in a panic so not to be directly offered gas over cash, etc).  Oh, and I assume this is implied, but the most important attribute - have no shame (if called out / Not afraid to ‘hustle’) and the ability to quickly establish rapport

Most people I knew who choose to fly signs agreed that standing at a busy intersection is much slower than hustling a specific high volume cash business. Ironically, most vegabonds I know refuse to fly a sign unless things are getting dire- but will spang/ preform / use local same-day cash employment centers
WhatYou cant really pay 250 a day for drugs... Only if you pay for overpriced crap :DDamn dude dont be so harsh to meAt least you care since you took time to read my statement and comment it aswell. Thank youDamn .. good luck brotha ! I’m at 20-30$ going up that’s good your coming down I’ll probably be following your path so your ahead of meI’m too stoned for this Vitamins and supplements are big ticket? And people think heroin is a waste of money, at least it works.80%? How tf he make money he gonna sell it for 90% seems not even worth it for how long he’d sit on whatever random items I wouldn’t expect a fence to go above 50-60% tbh[deleted][SITSA Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2851/text?format=txt) 

Yeah, it's got a lot of people upset as it's basically a blanket ban of any RC or herb that's not FDA Approved bullshit. 

Fuck 'em.There are hot spots all over my city. I was in a gas station like 2 months ago using the ATM and this couple who were definitely junkies came in from the side of the freeway right next to the gas station and were talking about how the last car that stopped off the freeway gave them a 100 bill. It was real, and they bought a shit load of scratchers, some cigarettes and then waltzed over to the motel to pick up I'm sure. 

I just looked up the statistic. The average is between 70-100 bucks a day in the United States. Do you work in sales lmaoyes you can. shooting 2-3 grams of gunpowder and .5-1g of coke a day. nothing i bought was overpriced.I'm sorry. 
You can go back into your safe-space. For real. I've seen bottles of supplements for 90$-150$ at GNC. Shits ridiculous.That was on the shit that I mentioned. Everything else was around 50percent. Expensive Olive oil was another one he would pay like 75-80percent on. Most of the time they traded the value in dope but on more than one occasion I got like 25$ for something worth 38$ when they didn't have dope. We were regulars, they liked us is what I assume lol.If you steal from Home Depot (not worth stealing form anymore as they’ve added lots of return protections), lowes, or any big store with building/construction materials contractors and construction companies will happily buy any gft cards or “merchandise cards” (from returns, basically a gift card) at 80%.

That is because one of the biggest costs on a project is materials, right next to labor. If they can save by buying a gift cards at %80 for  hundreds of dollars each, they can pocket that 20% they’re saving on materials.

They are constantly scouring craigslist for gift cards, I would get replies within minutes of posting a 300-500$ gift card asking for 80%While I agree with a majority of what you're saying, I don't think kratom use is significant enough to make a dent in sub or methadone sales- I could be wrong, though. Jesus Christ that's absolutely insane.You can definitely sustain a habit by just flying a sign- you'll likely still be homeless, though. For like 12 hours panhandling?Believe it or not, when I was using/selling ecp for 9 years I worked as both a stockbroker and then as a ultra high end B2B tech sales consultant for a megalith of a tech company that supplied other giant businesses with their servers/services/software, basically a full stack (a normal yet decent sale could be 1-5 million $, but those take a few months of going back and forth and such)

But when I say business I clearly mean ‘business’ and not my day job lol. I’ve been clean for 2 years now. Damn thats some good amount of money thereOh ok yeah I had a friend that used to do that and also owned a construction business himself so he had a business account with Lowe’s and would go in with a friend and load up a cart with what he needed as far as plywood and lumber usually about $1,000 then he’d pay for it on his business account while homie loaded an identical cart, after he got all the shit loaded in the truck he’d come back in find homie n push the cart to the other side of the store and return the shit so he’d have his materials and his cash lmao and they didn’t question it cuz he had an account and whatnot. I thought u meant u were literally selling an item of any kind for 80% like $100 drill for $80 to a fence and I was wondering how that dude was gonna profit cuz it’s hard to sell boosted shit at 90% of MSRP. All makes sense now though [deleted]yeah I was working at Facebook as an engineer making like 160k a year at least (incl. bonuses, before tax) right out of college but still living paycheck to paycheck (even going to pawnshops and shit) because of my speedball addiction. I quit the job and the addiction last year and I moved back home to refigure out my life. I feel you on that. Thats crazy man 160k ??? I always wonder what I have to do to get jobs like that. Even 80k would be great it is crazy I guess but I was living like a degenerate, needles all over the floor of my one room rented place. I really just studied my ass off in high school so I could get into MIT which has like the best comp sci program in the world. I hate comp sci though and realized I actually like the humanities more. So now I'm trying to figure out how to go back to school to study literature. I'll probably never have a salary like that again if I do, but hopefully I'll be happier than I was. Life can be weird... Sorry for being nosy, but I can't help but wonder whether you got addicted to drugs because you didn't like your job at heart even if it paid real well?I hate to bring bad news to a fellow opi hound but there isn’t any way in hell a literature degree is going to pay you 160k a year.   (Comm degree here)Not nosy at all. And for sure that was one of several reasons! It’s part of a larger general dissatisfaction but definitely a leading element. It looks like that might finally be behind me, I’m just not sure how to get a job that i do like. Oh believe me, I know doing real work in literature has almost no chance of making anywhere near that. I mean, if I can become a tenured professor at a decent college then maybe. But there’s also the chance that I study lit but then find a more practical career path afterwards, like law. Are you working yourself? Curious what the career paths are like when you study comm. 

But anyway, I don’t need a salary anywhere near my old one either, if I can stay clean.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I've been found out, Content: , ups: 634, downs: 0We are the addiction network. [deleted]Youtube starting giving me rehab commercials recently :/An the "doctor" looks sketchier than you do.Lol, that would kill me. And it kills me that there are fucking ads for rehab. *off to yt looking for the ads. Only in murica (no offense) I was on heroin.  I smoke crack cocaine. Passages is the worst.Passages Malibu "I used to be an addict..now I'm not" with that super pussy looking dude. Fuck lol

Best thing to see in the morning after waking up. Needed a laugh like this one.Shit, you guys have commercials for rehab? They are not private companies, are they?Goddamit I came up with this joke 8 months agoI was an addict for 13 years now I'm notLOL I upvoted bc I thought this was a joke. Went to Youtube looking for rehab commercials and the first thing that comes up is the addiction network. Ftw? capitalist dystopia parodying itself? I just think this is madly tasteless bc access to health services shouldn't be treated as a private good. Those who need rehab would seek it out but no, you have to be able to afford it and no ad changes the fact that you won't get that service if you don't have insurance or money. That pisses me off. As if you have to convince the target audience that they need rehab. As if rehab was some stupid cleanse or face treatment. Gah. They knowIf it makes you feel any better it’s not based on any life decisions that you make except ones you express online. You could watch a video about how great opioids are aaaaand bam! Advertisement!Very expensive ads too. Google actually just stopped allowing companies to run pay per click ads for rehabs to try and curb deceptive business practices. It really is an American phenomenon.Yes they are, they're predators, they don't care if you get better, hell, they don't want you to. They have no customer once your clean. But let's be honest, we'll never be clean, we will fight with this demon until we die.Considering this meme has been around longer than that, doubtful. I was on oxys. I was on heroin. I was addicted to crack cocaine. 

Hahaha, those are the worst commercials, ever. I literally laugh out loud every time I hear "now I'm not"Doesn't even understand how his own condition works while simultaneously promising the miracle cure; that guy can go fuck himselfHe never was an addict. [10 Disturbibg Facts About Passages Malibu](http://www.otcmarketwatch.com/10-disturbing-facts-about-passages-malibu-founders/)I thought once an addict always an addict but this dude beat it When you consider that the same people who parrot how great the market is for healthcare, also vote against subsidies to help you, vote against regulations that would help you not get screwed (enjoy your preexisting condition pleb), vote down your minimum wage, and also **Are the people behind prohibition**... it starts to look like a game that is pretty stacked against you.They always knowHhahaha I don't even watch videos about opiates, youtube just knows me too well ... When Google does the job the government opted out of. smhThat's cause most everything is privatized...from prisons to rehab. It's a fuckling $cam.That's pretty damn fucked upIsn't the addiction network the one that's the front group for Scientology?  I always thought it was weird they say Hubbard loved drugs trippin on acid/psychedelics yet they are so against drugs in their cult "Dont kid yourself. Addiction is an epidemic. We all know what happens when we don't deal with addiction. Someone dies... or *worse* they hurt others."Yea then not long after there's pics all over the web of him covering his face after relapsing and having to be a patient st the place he actually owns haha.

Just the guys name was so cringy douchey.Fucking Pax Prentis. What a succbag. Confusing  two different commercials. [Passages Malibu](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s96XdnN6bNE) & [The Addiction Network](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeIsWu_pXhw).Easy to say when you have never been an addict.Yeah you can be 40 years sober and still a addict you can never not be an addict I am 3 years sober haven't been to a meeting in 3 years never did the step shit I just decided I wanted to change things up I hit my bottom. Not saying I won't ever use again cause to be real I probably will but for right now I'm good. But I always call myself an addict when we get on the subject any REAL addict knows you are never not an addict. Oh my god... this is so fucked up. Thank you for sharing this.You ever get high at work? I used to do that shit all the time never thought about it till years later like fuck me I used to get lit at work but my co workers all got high my manager was my dude for awhile I even helped him out a few times and other co workers smoked like 3g's of crack with me for free he never would let me pay anything always hated that I loved sharing the high I always caught him back when I got some flake though.It has to do with almost all your online history. Including the fast you're on this subThe free market is efficient! Efficiently giving those in charge more wealth every year.I don't see any links between the two, but ADdict Net comes of as trying to sell itself as a local treatment center, when in reality, I think it is just a referral. I imagine they network ppl into state subsidized rehabs and get a fee. For the most part, I think the rehab industry is a bullshit. The same assholes who own stock in pain clinics, own stock in pharmaceuticals,  private prisons, and treatment centers. A bunch of people making money off of us chasing our tails. This is one aspect of my motivation for getting clean and staying clean. Rehab didn't get me clean, but seeing it for what a fucking scam it was a motivation.     
Edit- you may be thinking of [Narconon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narconon). Keep scrolling through the Wiki so you can see all the ppl who died while under their care. But considering how Scientology is all about the $, delving into the rehab business is not in the least bit surprising. LMFAO. Girl, you make my damn day �Like or worse they hurt others? Dafaqhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE8PgMHz98kOr worse....EXPELLED.Hahaha, are you serious? I haven't seen that. I don't like the guy either, but that's a rumor in the vein of "Steve from blues clues is dead." It's just simply untrue. Can you link us to something? I'm not from the US so I haven't seen the adsI'm an addict dude, relaxThat's more or less what I meant. We'll always be an addict once you become one, that's why I laugh.Yeah, father and son are real shitbags. Even if I was a real asshole and opened up a rehab for $ubsidies or cater to rich fucks, I would at least make an attempt to give ppl the tools for sobriety. The shithole I went to was basically fucking AA meetings 3 times a day, led by volunteers!? Out of 20 some ppl, I was the only 1st timer, and one of 2 that wasn't court ordered. Shit a1/3 of them were literally dropped off from Jessup (jail) for court ordered rehab...after serving year plus sentences. Those cats were actually the most serious about the program. Right? “Graduating” then smoking crack!What was your job?You know I was gonna say that wouldn't be true because I watch youtube on Firefox only (it stopped working on chrome for me for a while but now it's just habit) but I guess I'm logged into the same account on youtube and google chrome aye... freaky~~Yay~~...,Yeah Capitalism!Lol I know that stupid ass commercial by heart. But seriously, how can they say hurting others is WORSE than death? WTF.hiGuy's name is pax prentiss. Some kind soul linked the ad belowPassages Malibu [comercial](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s96XdnN6bNE)Relax Dude, I’m talking about PaxFront desk at a higher end hotel. My manager would sell me his scripts when he got em and I would go in and bust up a couple in the bathroom come back and he watched the desk. He didn't mind he always told me as long as it doesn't effect my work he is cool with me doing them there. When I worked nights I would smoke out just go out back sometimes with the regulars I would call up and ask em if they wanted to smoke. We would bullshit I would come back in finish up my nightly shift paperwork it was a sweet gig worked there for about 5 years till I just had to find something with better pay and more options for benefits. Even the owner of the hotel it was him and his 2 brothers owned like every hotel in my area the brother would do blow all the time my boss just drank from morning till night but he was chill as shit. Yeah probably the coolest place I ever worked as far as the employees go as for the guest that's another story haha.If you use an android phone it can read everything on that, unless you disable it[deleted]Holy fuck I'm dying at this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE8PgMHz98kHaha what a twat. Thanks for the link. My bad, sometimes it's hard to tell what people mean in text.That doesn't make sense. Any loving family would much rather the addict be alive than dead...The death of the junkie is going to fuck up that family more then anything. They’ll never be the same again. At least when alive you have a chance at getting sober and getting your life together. Lol did someone dose me with datura? I think its in there specifically targeting a certain demographic. The "Fuck my life, I don't care if I die I deserve it", super strung out, deep deep in addiction person. Theoretically, they realize their addiction isn't just hurting themselves - who they could give a fuck about - but also their family, who they care about. I am not saying it works at all, just saying it is probably the angle they were going for.I see what you're saying. Thanks for explaining it this way. I just thought it was a super weird thing to say in a commercial like that. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Medium Rare, Content: , ups: 627, downs: 0Why do they let people withdraw in Jail, it's fuckin sadistic[deleted]The bottom is definitely the case, went to the treatment center down in Florida, was hooked up with all of that. 

But I’ve also kicked massive fentanalog use while in jail, as well as kicked suboxone and noids together in another trip to jail. LOOOOOOOLFor any interested, tramadol as well as others, are available OTC in the Dominican Republic I've done all of these except the bottom 2 fmlRaw steak- The same as rare except you pay an arm and a leg to buy a sub in jail and then put yourself into pwd by taking it too early.Put me down for #3...� done that at least 200x over 30 yrsMy pain doc says that Tramadol is harder to quit than Oxycodone. (In equianalgesic doses.)Been there done all of these. Except it was 150 mg of methadone. I ain’t even going into what I was in the jail cell for bc it’s fucking embarrassing.There should be one near the top that says, "Purposely putting yourself into precipitated wd so it only lasts for 48 hours and not 5 days."Dude the medically induced coma for WD is actually the best fucking idea ever. Done all these except the medical coma (2nd to last) also replace the florida treatment center with a dif. E. Coast city and also not a tramadol habit.  From what I have heard tho tramadol as a hell of a withdrawl... Alwats wondered if it was true.the first one is the worst hands down!Hmm, I seem to like my WDs medium rare, just like my steak. Ive done them all except been to jail, but also i wasnt on subs when i was getting sll the other stuff, just that plus a few robaxin. Also i wasnt on 250 mg of methadone. Got to 70 and they kicked me out so had to go cold turkey off itMedium for meThe bottom one is so good How is quitting in jail worse than quitting under a Bridge while homelees ?Haha I do #3 almost monthly from pill withdrawl hahahaI could potentially be raw on Thursday  ���I don't get the masturbation part.  Is that because of your sex drive returning?  Or just something to do while you're stuck in bed?Shitty analogy, well done steak is garbage and blue rare is the best, so this doesn't even make sense at all.Has ANYONE ever CT’d off of 250mg? That’s my current dose����� but I’m going to begin titrating next month for 9 months (20% a month) until I’m done. MEDIUM RARE ALL DAYDamn I turn myself in on the 27th. I'm at 22mg methadone today and will be going down the rest of the month. I on 80mg about a month ago.Lmao I feel this meme. I just detoxed for like the last 5 days off like a weird up-and-down amount of opiates like some days I would take maybe 30-60mg of oxy a day, some days I would take like 120-150 mg, some days suboxone, but SOMETHING everyday, well anyway I did that for like 3 months thinking I was slick and wasn’t gonna have to detox, long story long I DID have to detox. I had to leave work early for the day Friday and the weekend was hell, I still feel like dog shit today and I’ll probably feel shitty tomorrow too. But I think I’m nearing the end of the withdrawals! Suboxone and Buspar??!

Sounds like a party. Ain't no sex like Suboxone-Buspar beach sex!This hit close to home hahaThis is so on pointRight in the middle rn but not $80 a day. Lower dose and my dope is cheaper[deleted]A lot of things about jail are pretty sadisticBecause the US society likes to see people suffer. Of course it is sadistic, but all the prisons in the US are. It is like Russia. Rape, beatings, etc. In many jails they'll give you valium, tylenol, and immodium for about three days.Under this meat-metric, burnt to a crisp would equate to *I took 15mg codeine yesterday, can I take 15mg more today? Or am I going to have withdrawals?*SameIt’s this way because only pussies would order a well done steak.It's 'rare' to see the more difficult ones.How was kicking noids I heard it’s actually withdrawal compared to how weed has none. Thailand tooWhat else is available over the counter there and how expensive are they? I’m going there soonInteresting.... any benzos?By "others" do you mean other opiates? For instance, are oxycodone or oxymorphone OTC?How about Nepal? Anyone know what's easily available otc there?Think that just means you ain’t a pussyThis comment hit me so hard I can taste sweat and artificial citrus[deleted]Awe man...
Come on now! You can't just say THAT and expect US to NOT wanna know why now?!Hey this is anonymous....just tell us lol You don’t just do that to us...does that work?Wait, Is that a thing?Man that temp would be “black and blue”Yes it's terrible because of the SNRI activity coupled with the opioid activity.

A lot more manic depressive than just opioid wd in my opinion. It’s hell. Imagine detoxing off an opiate and antidepressant at the same time. For me, going through this a couple of times, it took me 2 weeks to feel like myself again. The first week is hell. Phenibut and gabapentin were key on helping WD’s. Sorry never been put in a coma eitherLmfao same here.  Every month I run out way too early and have to wait for Christmas aka refill dayWhy do you say that?And you feel a lot better after you’re done. Something about that dopamine rushBecause it takes .2 seconds to orgasm lmao For some reason it feels super good and you wanna keep doing it lolDopamine[deleted]I thought of it as “you could eat a steak well done, but why the hell would you?” Same for the bottom, you could spend a zillion dollars to come off that way but you don’t need to. You could achieve the same with some kratom or lope for such a tiny habit and youre risking a medical coma. You’ve basically ruined the steak. [deleted]Don't worry just tell them ur an alcoholic and bennie addict an they will have to hook up Librium and u will sleep thru it.  U prob won't suffer at all.  Hope ur bunkie is chill with all the tossing n turning.It's a bona fide opioid with a side order of SSRI-esque dependency. It's like taking hydrocone/codeine and an antidepressant at the same time. It's absolutely addictive.NoJail is sadisticNot opiates. They'll give you water and tell you to suck it up. 

Lot: tell them you have a benzo or alcohol habit, and you have seizures. They'll give you Librium for the first weekFrom what I’ve read, some of those are a nasty m’f*ker to kick. One story I read was some guy said he had to smoke every 30-45 minutes to stop from going into WD. There was a documentary on VICE I believe that followed a few folks in the UK that were addicted and they said the same thing, they legit need to smoke every 30 minutes before going into hellish wd.

That’s all I need to know to never touch that sh*t!noids?

Oh yeah it was brutal, honestly harder than dope. Almost as intense and short as fent withdrawal, really it’s almost like the same type of chemical, just different class. Incredibly potent and short acting like fent, just a noid instead of opioid. Like seriously, hell on earth. 

And I made up my own smoke since 2011, once my area banned it, we learned what to do, and while I smoked it, it was either batches I, or my partner and crime would whip up. So it was all noid withdrawal too.Absolutely. I was smoking 14g a day at my worst point. I can't stress enough how bad this shit is. The withdrawals and residual psychotic symptoms (that I now require antipsychotics for) are seriously not worth it.Used to be able to get them shipped to USA pretty easily from Bangkok, but before national scheduling, the DEA dumped a shit load of money into beefing up anti drug task forces in Thailand. I would order 5 to 10 thousand at a time for pennies a piece. Good times. And Spain. Myanmar. Cambodia. Honestly too many places to count. OTC trams and valiums made for an interesting work trip... hahaDon't even get me started on Cambodia. Drug paradise.Codeine is OTC in Belize� me too!!It eases the RLS if nothing else.Yeah, if you take Subs before you're in wd. It feels like a week worth of wd fit into two days though. So it hurts like, a lot.You still will have 3-5days of withdrawal left.  Putting yourself into PWD won't speed up the overall process.Maybe one day I'll learn. Nahhhh probably not shit this month I've been on kratom only for the past 6 days. On Thursday I get a little from a friend that I will have to pay back on refill day thus continuing this cycle lolDopamine... helps restless legs... and feels good for a fleeting moment.I guess if you look at it that way.Nice name lolI've never seen it before the two clinic by me do not. There's one that might but I've been wanting to get off for a while so the time is now.The fucked up part is it's for shoplifting from Kohl's �����I've seen them let someone go into DTs from alcohol withdrawal without  providing help, it was disturbing.That is absolutely true. I've only ever smoked spice a handful of times and one hit had me in a panic attack for 20 minutes. Seems awful to smoke all the time.

However my bf's best friend since high school was a dope addict for many years and we used to buy dope from him. About 3 years ago he got hooked on spice. He has huge bags of the stuff all over his room. When he has it, he's an absolute zombie but just as you said, he needs to smoke every 30 minutes or else he'd be vomitting and having full blown panic attacks. It just seems horrid. Unfortunately we cut ties with him when he wanted my bf to start dealing spice, and read on our local PD Facebook a while ago he had his house raided for selling it. Idk how long the wd lasts but it does look like hell.I was every hour. Shit was farked.Synthetic canabanoids. Like all of those k2 and spice and fake weed.  homeless people been loving going crazy on that shit. That’s a shame.  I’m sure you could go dark and get em from there, no?Lol in Cambodia right now and Valium & Xans are easier to buy than water � I lied. The mdone habit I kicked in jail was 180 mg a day but I took a triple dose before court lol. I was trying so hard not to nod in front of the judge[deleted]I had no idea Precipitated Withdrawals on purpose was a thing!

It really condensed the 5 days of hell into 2 instead?!That's what I figured [deleted]How much timeYeah there's a lot of stories out there about folks dying from benzo and alcohol withdrawals on their first night cus the guards can't be fucked to do anything about it. Shit's fucked. Especially when it's in the middle of a prison dorm and there's 20 people in the room listening to someone seizing all night while the guards tell them to fuck off back to sleep.The full CB2 agonists led to me having worse withdrawals than Ive ever experienced from 6 years of heroin addiction. I was selling like you mentioned also. But that wasnt even when it was bad. 

When I became too addicted to maintain making the big batch and selling it, I was just smoking the powder. It was 5f-akb48 and a gram of powder could make 1-2 ounces of finished spice. The same gram of powder was only lasting a day, maybe. I was at that every 25-30 min mark or intense wd. When I finally got off the shit, the wd didn't decrease intensity whatsoever for 2 weeks.oh ya, never heard it called noids before.  here they call it tune or tunchi.

and yes it can cause withdrawals similar to opiate withdrawal.  they can be pretty addicting.

sometimes those spice/k2 blends don't just have random synthetic cannabinoids in them but also synthetic research benzos and opiods too.I also have heard pretty bad stories about it seems to be nearly as bad as opiates and possibly more dangerous.  Never done the shit myself because most are pure agonists at the cannabinoid receptor.  Delta 9 thc is a mixed agonist/antagonist if I remember correctly.My guess isn’t so much the ordering is the issue as much as customs. 

If your going to try smuggling a 100 pills through customs to make some money why not move something worth the risk and investment like mdma or literally anything other than tramadol  but why  would you? if ur on dnms already you can get anything id be ordering eu oxy or american pandas like shit you can even get real  fent free dope. anyone who order trams off the dn is complelty  retatded lolYes, you can.EwwwwI’d never dare do that. I did it on accident once and NEVER AGAINDon't do this. Mine always lasted like 3 days and it's way more fucking intense than normal withdrawal. Fuck all that.Only 45 days with half time so it's about 3 weeks just enough time to kick. 45 days it's my second shoplifting charge though.I doubt that. Why on earth would the Chinese do that if they can just crank out a new generation of shitty noids. Nah, they may feel sedating or dissociative because we have no idea of their receptor interactions but noids are most likely noids and not cut with substances you can actually have a selling point for.Yeah my sister is a dr and has seen a few kids overdose and die from it. It’s very rare but def can happen which is surprising that a canabanoid is even able to cause that. 

I forget what the cause of death is. I don’t believe it’s from depressed breathing like opiates Exactly. This is why we don't get hash in Australia like we used to. Smugglers worked out that a kg of heroin or meth was just as hard to get in as a kg of hash, but the return on the risk is orders of magnitude better.Yeah makes total sense lolLol I feel you.  Tramadol is far from my (or anyone’s) doc.  I was just saying that the guy whose stuff keeps getting seized can always try dnms if he really wants to get those trams.  After a few years of use I can get anything I want in my city and stopped using the dw to source.  Shit, my guy even has fent-free heroin, tested at my doctor’s lab to be high quality and purity.  Getting personal use amounts of oxy on dms to Australia is next to impossible because our customs is fucking crazy hot on searching packages. I don't know how Aussie vendors get it through but vendors in EU usually refuse to even try to send here. Trams, heroin and meth are just more commonly sold by AU vendors and much cheaper, probably because smuggling routes from Asia are more established and still work better.Yeah that sounds horrible but for the time constrained individual might be nice if you can stand the WDs

I’ve never taken subs... I’m planning on using some soon. How long do I need to wait and how much should I take?

Like 4mg strip and I do like 150mg IV? After waiting 36 hrs? Fuck that. I’d rather deal with five days than 3 days of pure hell. Thanks for the heads up!>But we've now seen cases where other types of chemicals are being found in herbal synthetic mixtures, including highly potent opioid relatives of fentanyl as well as benzodiazepines.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/07/19/why-synthetic-marijuana-is-more-dangerous-than-ever/#43da815be767

>“We call these cannabinoids but that doesn’t mean they are—this is probably one of the most varied substances we’ve seen, we don’t know how these things metabolize in the body.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/synthetic-weed-is-back-bigger-than-ever-and-scary-as-hellIdk if this has anything to do with it, but the 2 places where I used to donate plasma had a real strict policy against spice and had posters all over explaining that in rare cases it can cause bleeding, both internal bleeding and bleeding of the gums.

And I can't even imagine what it might do to your lungs, just based on the smell/taste/feel when smoking it. I've only ever taken one hit a few separate times and it was just a panicky hell for 15 minutes. I hate it, can't understand how people smoke it.Yep this is why prohibition creates incentives for stronger and more dangerous drugs. We saw the move from cocaine to meth and now we’re seeing the switch from heroin to fent. 

The war on drugs has always been a losing battle but it’s only going to get worse as our knowledge of chemistry grows. Is the tested heroin more expensive in comparison to the strength and duration of the fentadope?  Will a 40 bag of fent/dope hit harder than the real shit?

I think fentanyl analogues will end up increasing the demand for high purity heroin.  Although I believe this will drive the price of heroin up if only because profit margins will be less as the customer demands a pure product. 

 I think there are many people myself included who have basically stopped using besides maintenance.  I know many that have stopped because of the absence of high quality fent free dope and would likely use at least occasionally if quality product was more available.Its my doc.... What i started on ...Wait as long as you possibly can, then take a sliver of the strip (like 1mg worth).  24-36 hours+

Wait 30-45 mins, take another sliver.  Repeat until you feel better.

Some people will tell you they can switch back and forth between dope and subs no problem and they never get bad WD's, other people wait 24 hours and still end up feeling shitty from subs.  Best way to do it IMO is just take it slow, a little sub at a time.That sounds like a pretty solid plan.  You probably don't need to wait the full 36 hours.  Google the COWS scale and rate yourself once you're feeling unbearable withdrawals.  Wait at least 14-16 hours, and if you score a moderate to severe on the scale, you are good to begin inducting at like 1-2 mgs MAX under the tongue.  If after two hours you're still feeling crappy, take another mg.  Rinse and repeat until you reach 8mgs max for your first day.
A full 8 mgs is excessive, and you shouldn't need THAT much, but everyone is different, and you will decide how much makes you feel comfortable in your own skin again.  
Personally, I like to maintain on a low dose like 1-2 mg/day, max 4mgs split dose: 2-morning and 2 at night.  But in full withdrawal, coming from a heavy 1-2 gram per day dope habit, I find flooding my receptors with buperehnorphine the only way I can get out of withdrawal.
Slowly titrate and give the medicine time to work.  It's strong and you'll be successful!I still doubt that the Chinese would mix opioids or benzos into their blends. Whatever some idiot dealer might do is unpredictable. It's still idiotic. Benzos don't work well smoked and if fentanyl in herbal blends was more widespread we'd say a whole other picture of overdoses.I mean there is a LOT of variance in different brands and blends. Although a lot of them now are just panicky hell, there are probably some out there that aren't, although I'm not gonna go looking for them lol. The earlier generations were a lot different though with most of them being a lot closer to regular weed, just with some more psychedelic effects or more stimulating/depressing effects. They all got banned though (rip) so now it's just a bunch of random shit thrown together that they'll sell as long as it's active and not banned yet. On top of that there's also a lot of personal variance in reactions because endocannabinoid receptors can be quite unique from person to person, so some people just think it's panicky hell not worth touching cus that's all they've experienced but others will have different reactions that are less hellish to the same compounds. Also the majority of use now is in homeless people with fuck all to do who are down for basically anything, even panicky hell, as long as it's something other than reality, so they don't really give a shit as long as there's some relief.

Like I'm not recommending trying them or going hunting for a good blend (mostly cus itll be banned again in a month lol) but yeah there is, or at least was, a lot of variance. I haven't touched any of it in years cus of analogue laws in Australia basically banning any and all RCs so you can't just go to a baccy shop and buy some "incense" here anymore, and also because regular weed is just much more consistently good and safer.Realist comment in this entire post. Fair enough, my mistake.  Sorry, it’s just not super common. Okay thank you! I’ll make sure to at least wait 24hrs and make sure I can’t take it anymore. 

I’m not planning on maintaining using the Suboxone. So at what point can I go back to using heroin again? Like a day after the last dose or so? 24hrs?

Edit: Read your second half — saw the wait 24 hours! I wait until I am kicking hard to take subs to avoid PWD. I will definitely utilize that for this, just googled it. The COWS scale is great, thanks you!! 

What should I expect the subs to do? I should still feel a tad meh right? Just that’s about it? I’ve read a bit and it seems it varies on the individual. 
Seriously, don't believe every article you read on the internet. Half the posts about Kratom are so biased and intentionally ignore the evidence of overdose situations. Like, someone who took Kratom overdosed, but the article fails to mention the other chemicals that said person may have had in their system.That's true. 24hr MINIMUM. Seriously 36hr is a more realistic minimum if you use daily. I'd rather wait nearly 48hr just to avoid PWD. Projectile vomiting 15min after taking suboxone is not enjoyable.Same, I wait till I absolutely can't take it anymore then dose a sliver at a time till I feel better. The longer you wait, the better the effect of the sub imoYou should feel pretty good your first time doing subs.  It eliminates physical withdrawal but I would still get cravings really bad.  Hopefully yours will be minor though.  Lmk how they make you feel!I wouldn’t exactly say “meh”. I think they’re fabulous if you’re in a serious mindset of quitting dope altogether. They allow for you to feel normal again while still being on a routine of “having something”.  On subs (or at least in my opinion), you really have to make a true, conscious decision to seek it out and use again.Exactly the Forbes article has no secondary sources.Okay thanks! I definitely just wanna play it safe than sorry... all these PWD experiences I’m reading just seem like hell on earth. YepThanks for the tip. Def gonna do this. 

Kinda seems like idk if anyone else does this but... sometimes I like to get a little sick on purpose so I feel extra good when I fix my shot and get high I will be sure to let you know! I am going to be getting some over the next week so I’ll have to follow up then. I’m happy the physical stuff will go away — it’ll def help me out at work. 

I’m pretty excited tbh. I might just use it to hopefully get me by enough to the point where I can power through the weekend then hop off. Or just use them to keep me at bay till I pickup again... cannot decide. I just know that I need to take a tolerance break from near daily usage. 
I haven’t pursued a legal prescription route. However if I ever plan on getting off dope it seems like subs might be a good option. 

Usually I just cold turkey (with comfort meds) or try to taper down as much as possible then jump off. I’m kinda more or less getting to that point where I need to stop again :/. 

Are you currently on subs or used them? It seems like it really helped you out (just how I’m interpreting your response)  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 10/10 I would try, Content: , ups: 626, downs: 0But what if you already sold your house for dope? [deleted]I’ve been in WD for 3 days. I hate existence.I "allegedly"burned our house down and almost died. Then realized i had 3 30's and 15 or so oc 40's so I ran past the fire fighters and saved them, passed out from smoke inhalation, woke up homeless, but had my shit. Addiction is a horrible disease. Been sorta clean ever since that was 14yrs agoI actually knew a person that died like that. RIP FSCYo no bed sheets can light the fuck up lol bad experience If I had a dollar for everytime I burned a hole in my basketball shorts from nodding out and/or dropping my cig on myself I could afford new shorts.

I definitely would have had fire issues haha.I once fell asleep in bed with a cigarette and woke up 20 mins later with the blankets on my chest in huge flames. Alarms were going off wife was screaming everything. I calmly grabbed the bedding and went into the shower with it. I've stopped smoking and most opis years ago at this point, sometimes take a pic or two but that's it. I still have burn marks all over my chest from all the times I fell asleep with one in my mouth and didn't feel it burn me. Fun times.I still have a fat scar on my shoulder from dropping a lit cig there during a nice nod. Good thing Jeff forgot his shower shoes and came back to the room or I'd have probably fucked up my pretty face and/or burned the hotel down.This has really happened to me. Twice.r/shittylifeprotips

Edit:tipsThis joke is dark... I love it. unfortunately, my carpet seems flame retardant. The proof is the dozens of burn marks near my bed, recliner, and computer chair. Also,FSC (fire safe cigarettes), as others have mentioned, contribute to my ongoing misery too. i'm cool with the nod life. Oh man. I knew this bitch that had a black leather love seat and that motherfucker had like 40 burn holes in the right arm rest. I don't know how she didn't die.dankrecovery is omnipotentSomehow I'm 0-for on that front. I have to have almost killed myself in a fire like 200 times to no avail. My bf at the time and i were on a big chaise lounge like chair, nodding. Woke up with the house completely full of smoke, with the half of the chair we were not on completely smoldering. Was an area about 2 ft by 2 ft. Coulda totally died.No. Just set my apartment on fire and woke up to it, luckily.True story r/technicallythetruth[deleted]Why has godforsaken me? Fuckin fsc :(If I nod out with a cig I dont drop it. It stays in place and burns the living fuck out of my fingers.Loser Boo shit memeYou can still burn down your cardboard box. I miss non-fire safe cigarettes. Yeah that's why there's lines on the ciggarette paper now, it's for that[deleted][removed]FSC "Fire safe Cigarette" more chemicals to make it burn out whenever you don't hit itIt's effective for the beginning and middle of the cigarette, but I find that the fire safe cigs are much less likely to go out when you're down to 25% or less. In fact, on my cheap Sonoma Menthol 100s, after 25% it's much more likely that the heater itself will fall out completely. Which is even more likely to start a fire in my experience, having started a few small fires this way lol.That’s why u buy cheap natives or the bag ones

Anything without the rings that make it go out so I die properly 



Hahah no
If I was gonna kill myself over being sick I woulda done it one of the hundred times before today Damn dude, hope you're able to score again soon.Hi me too. Ur lucky it almost over.
 I mean I have methadone if I want but. Not the same. So I don’t take itSame here. The kid I knew was a piece of shit but still didn't deserve to go like that. He wasn't high on dope though, he was drunk as fuck.that made me burst out laughing lmao my chest hurtsYou died *twice?*Did you mean to say *fortunately* ?Once my barred out friend tried to cook ramen by taking this plastic thing you cover a cake with and throwing it on the stove eye with an unopened pack of ramen in it. My inherent laziness prevents this. I would've just eaten the ramen uncooked and woke up in a bunch of broken up ramen.This is why i like this sub, people dont give enough of a fuckin crucify this man over having a differing opinion.Jokes on you, I'd trade a box for dope any day lolYeah I remember right when they mandated it, you could get the regular ones if the store still had any back stocked and we compared the old ones to the new "fire-safe" ones, it was like night and day...just extra chemical tasteCan still get they’re just shittier brands and illegal markets or natives Lines have always been on cigs even before they made FSCI thought that was to make them burn straight. The lines help it burn more evenly. The paper is basically corrugated > chest

ow I’ve replaced my sheets 3 times already.I remember it being mildly different and slightly annoying and now, people  don’t  notice until someone says something then it’s a pile on but really I doubt anyone thought of it during their first smoke
Today unless they were reading this at that exact time
My paycheck comes in direct deposit at midnight, and I’m calling my dealer so god damn early.Damn that sucks man either way. Yea it would take a lot to deserve to die like that lol. In the persons case who I knew was just an older lady who was hooked on oxy and passed out in her trailer and then had a lit cig. Sucked cause she was a mom. i think i did.HuhYou can stay in mine for some dope.There was a period of two months or so that I only bought soft-packs because they tended to be less popular, meaning they were more likely to still be non-FSC at that time.

They really were much better before.This Wikipedia articles says all they do is add more paper to make it burn unevenly. How does that make it taste different?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safe_cigaretteI don’t live anywhere near any natives. and i’m stuck in my marlboro menthol ways, lol. Fuckin Safe Cigarettes FSC = Fuckin Safety Cigarettes?[deleted]No, not true . There's usually 2 or 3 bands on em. 
Bands are "speed bumps"TIL...Lol ya mattress look like Swiss cheese tho. And I know cuz ours probably look the same
I can’t afford to fix the mattress tho I no longer smoke in my house ... ughHaha, I know that feeling. Glad you don't have much longer to wait.Damn, always sad when a mother dies especially in such an avoidable situation.Im highDon't tease me with a good time �What do you mean how do they taste different? I had been smoking before they made them fire safe and when they mandated it they put FSC above the barcode so we compared them with the old ones by finding older packs that weren't FSC and everyone that compared them could tell a difference, the FSC just tasted like more chemical/less tobacco flavor than the original

FSC really stands for Fire Safe Cigarettes, they put FSC right above the barcode on them..Cigs def had lines long before FSC. It’s for measurement, they’re like 2 mm per line.I couldnt stand the FSC marlboro menthols when they first came out. They took twice as long to smoke and burned too slow. The non fsc cigs definitely tasted way betterYeah but I’m raging the fuck out I have cold sweats i sweat to god I tucking wanna kill myself right now I can’t take this shitMe TooYea they had lines printed on the ppaper.  What they are talking about is the new FSC (fire safety cigarettes) that replaced the old non fire safe cigarettes around 2010 depending on where you live.  These new FSC cigarettes will go out when you stop puffing on it.

Some brands of FSC cigarettes have bands of what look like a clear strip of glue on the paper that are about 1/2 centimeter long and spaced a centimeter or so apart.

Some brands dont have the glue lines. My newports im looking at don't have glue bars. I think marlboros are a brand that have them.Its sucks, that is why I fucking quit. Suboxone is my friend. Cheap as hell, not sick, guaranteed not to use cause it's a blocker. I just take my stupid strip in the morning and move on with my life. There's so much more to do besides either suffering or nodding.No access to kratom? That stuff is a lifesaver for me.Sounds like we are on the better half of this sub.What are the use of these glue lines?Yeah. I've been on this sub a long time. Folks are either over the top friendly or total assholes...

Aka high or in wdThey are too thick to burn by themselves so if you're not puffing it it goes out when the cherry hits that part.Yup this sub in a nutshellboofholes*Yea exactly, so when they came out my cigs were always going out and I'd have to relight it...it ends up making you smoke the cig faster and take bigger pulls and take puffs more often..it's just more bullshit they've added to make cigarettes even more unhealthy, all in the name of "safety"... @@@@@@@@@@ Title: A morphine bottle from about 1880, Content: , ups: 622, downs: 01880? Looks like something from 2880...Bang that shit.


In all seriousness, that's pretty cool. Thanks for sharing. Perfect for boofing.may be a stupid question but how tf do you get it out lmaoThis kinda stuff, along with just that whole time period where you could just buy stuff like this always interests me a ton and makes me start wishing I could go back in time. There are no words to describe how much I want this. I would pay exorbitant amounts of money for this. I collect antique items (my home is full of them), and since I'm very much interested in medicine and psychopharmacology, this would be the pinnacle of collectables. Especially because opiates have a particularly important role in our history and even brain evolution. I'm going to be thinking about how much I wish I could have this for ages now. It is truly beautiful. That's dopeInteresting butt plug � �️oof itThat thing has to be worth some doughGimme!Looks like a meth pipe TBHAm i the only one who thinks this looks like a potion from Shrek 2?Has anyone seen "the knick"?

Salute, comrade.Yes pleaseGonna need a real clean break on the stem for that to not cut up your asshole �Unless the glass tip breaks in your anusGreat minds think alike. BOOF BOIZ 4 LYFEThese are called [Ampoules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule). The stem is usually a weak point  and can be snapped (using your hands) to gain access to the contents. 

Files were/are also often used to create a score mark to make opening easier. Break it A true junkie never needs to ask this question. Innovation is one of his key wasted talents you break it likee you'd do with an ampule that would be broken to open todayyeah, walk into a chemists and ask for Laudanum, no questions asked. Or raw opium. Toothache? cocaine will do the job. 

I liked reading De Quinceys "Confessions of an English Opium Eater" in which he describes how he would drink the Laudanum, or raw Opium if he had it, and would go to an opera in bliss. Reminds me of my early days getting high and playing TFC.

He then describes how he then developed a habit, and because Laudanum also had strong alcohol in it, he was addicted to both opium and laudanum. He had a weeks long withdrawal and it did not sound pleasant. He had the mind-fuck dreams/looping thoughs where he was in a massive city and it felt like 1000 years passed for him.

I wonder why they banned opium, but kept alcohol legal? Was it to piss off the Chinese immigrants? Same with cannabis. Problem with opium is that it is very easy to die of an OD. Stupid kids would buy it, take a high dose, not feel anything in 20 minutes and take another high dose.  Then the first one hits and they are in bliss. Then the 2nd one hits and they die. 

I'd have opiates (morphine, oxycodone, H, codeine, etc) legally available to buy at low prices (it costs cents to produce a dose of morphine) - but it would be strictly behind the counter, and you would need an ID card to buy it. To get this ID card you must piss positive on a drugs test to prove you are a user. (Maybe even a short test to prove you know what you are doing). Then there would be strict penalties on selling to other people, especially children. But other than that, you go in, show your ID, "I'll have 50 OC80's please"I have 5 or 6 Morphine bottles from  the US War of Aggression on the Southern States. My grand dad gave them to me..I'll post the pics later. The paper is super fragile..yeah opiates have been used for thousands of years and society never collapsed. The ancient egyptians knew the secret of the poppy. The greeks knew about its sleep enhancing properties.  After the dark age collapse, during the renaissance, it was available in chemists shops in the UK no questions asked - during this time Britain built the biggest empire at that time.

It was the USA that forced the world to ban opiates. A bully boy country. Honestly, you described that so well, made your appreciation for antiques so clear, I wish I could buy it for you!Seriously? The fact that the label looks like it was made yesterday doesn't raise any flags to you as an "antique collector"? I've got a bunch of these out in my great grannies old root cellar, and an awesome bridge in Brooklyn, if your interested pm me. Price negotiable. Yes    it isEverything is a buttplug if your brace enough That show was dope. Wish it was still on. Exactly. People so Damn gullible these days. Label isn't even worn or damaged. *Your mom looks like a potion from Skyrim* �Just getting into the blood stream faster1 guy 1 morphine bottleits worth noting that you should always use a micron filter when using ampoules, as there’s microscopic shards of glass in it. I wonder if they had similar technology back then or if they even realized that was an issue.What about cutting your hands on glass I’ve seen lots of sterile water ampules made Of glass with I think something similar? i’m no junkie. just a lurker who thinks all this drug shit is super interesting i had no idea an ampule was even a thing till a little bit ago lmao Yeah I'm down for all that. Shit would be fantastic>"I'll have 50 OC 80s please"

>"Yes that'll be $50"Sounds like somebody is from the south. I'm weak as fuck at u broYou mean the civil war?> US War of Aggression on the Southern States

Based and redpilled.War of Aggression on the Southern states??? Do you genuinely believe that?I just posted a pic of these..Good one, boss. School those carpetbaggers! While I see why they got banned from a safety standpoint (considering how many lives I've personally seen crumble around me due to opiates), I agree wholly with you. Allowing things to be fully studied and understood is the only way to use their positive properties, and overcome the negative. All illicit drugs are left out of important research and people can't talk about it because of the taboo, and this creates the issues imo. Addiction is just starting to make real headway in medicine. Maybe future understanding can lead to an age of decriminalized opiates (and anything else).And now the us is all dying of fent. Isn't it ironic, dont ya think?

Its lilliililiiiliiliiiiliiiiike  feeeeeent on your coping day, its it's a free ride (to the ER) but you've already paid.I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish you could buy it for me too �I've never seen any antique medicines. It does look a little strange, but I figured it was photo shopped to make it look nice. I've never seen ampules like this, so the thing in the pic has to be pretty old regardless. Maybe the label is new tho. I would very much be interested, but it would need to be shipped across a boarder so unlikely that's possible :(Dr. Thackary would write me the best scripts, wish I was alive back thenWhy do they even make vials? isnt there a storage method that doesnt involve broken glassThe glass is gonne break ONLY at the breaking point. If you cut yourself with that, you should not have access to these morphium vials \^ \^That's the whole point though, you see. At that time the hypodermic needle was still in its infancy and so certainly not easily available to your local chemist let alone a layman. The fresh wound almost always resulting from opening the bottle allowed for a simple, fast, and, given the time, efficient method of administering the drug into the blood stream providing instantaneous relief while the remainder could be consumed orally as needed for the ailment. There’s a technique to it https://youtu.be/3o-_E26rmWAI always use a OSHA approved method of a sock and channel locks because ampoules scare me and my eyeballs.Hey friend. I didn’t mean to imply you were a junkie, sorry mate.  
Was literally just making a joke about the resourcefulness of the average junkie, especially when drugs are at stake![deleted]For the daily dose.This guy has a pic of him with Trump right on his page, I’m not surprised lol. “War of Aggression” that’s a classic. The proper nomenclature is what I called it but it is known as the Civil Way. Lol Southern people hate that they fought a war over their right to enslave other humans so they try and make it like they were attacked unprovoked. In the articles of secession filed by every state in the Confederacy they all specifically cite slavery.My kin  lived it. We had huge  family farms in Alabama and Georgia confiscated by the US Govt, a long with all my family assets and our guns. Give em a Missouri Boatride..In the 1950's, the public was terrified of homosexuals, putting them in prison, saying they hunted and "turned" boys. They even made a film called "Boys Beware" where a homosexual was described as having a "sickness". Homosexuals lived in secret and were ashamed. There were big public figures who were homosexual, who hid it and hypocritically spoke out against gays.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the present day, homosexuals are liberated and open. Now, Junkies are stigmatized as being sick in the head, bad people, weak people. Just because we use a substance that is actually safer than alcohol. There are people in society who use and keep it well hidden. Here in the UK, lots of high flying businessmen use cocaine. Hell I had a boss in my school who I suspect used it (he was from London, always gurned his teeth, had unnatural amounts of energy) - yet they will all speak out against it if asked. 

Maybe we will get legalization, who knows. 10 years ago I would have said the USA would never allow legal, recreational cannabis. Yet here we are, some states and Canada have it.  The UK will be the last as our politicians are all cowards and boy lovers.Ampoules provide better protection from air/ moisture etc than other forms of storage and have an all glass interior for better inertness.Yeah that just sounds dumb to me lol, why they would use this instead of bottle is beyond me Why care about your shredded hands? Chug that morphium and on you areLolllll And if you *do* cut yourself, you handily have access to these morphium ampoules!haha, I must be really clumsy - looked up videos on how to break ampoules, did it exactly as I saw and still managed to cut myself..

edit: actually the morphine vials broke fine, it was a reagent test kit ampoule that got me.no please don’t be sorry i wasn’t offended at all! you didn’t bother me or upset me or anything at all i was just saying lolyeah it's a joke the markup. A dose of H apparently costs 10 cents to make. It might even be as low as 1 cent.Oh god. Que the debate about a 150 year old war nobody cares about in 3..2...1I am a business man, my company does $400M a year in  Govt contracting. When u get a chance to go to dinner with the Man, you go. I bet those Northern assholes took all of your family's slaves too! Fucking pricks!Your point is...? The Nazi party also had all of their land and assets confiscated after Germany was defeated in WW2. Doesn’t make their actions okay, same goes for the Confederacy. I don't know what that is but it sounds kinky af. Go to Mississippi  and walk down the street  holding hands with another man.  Let me know how that works out.Its a cycle that also happened with booze too. PS I'm truly sorry that Boris Johnson also happens to literally look like a boy, I can't take the man seriously. I live in Canada so I know the feeling of cowardly and pointless seeming politicians. But hey we got the weed now, so ot makes me hopeful for the future! Break it with your teeth and chug it like a bawsFellow longtime lurker, one of my fave subs My homie lives in Pakistan and can get a gram of some pure Heroin #3 for 90 rupees which is a less then 25 cents.Hahaha, nah. Nothing to debate. Just funny.I highly disagree, I'd say a lot if people still care about that war.That’s true, good for you. 

Edit: How do I get the gov to pay me too?Do you mean the company you own or work for? Curious is all. Good for you with way.Plenty of southerners ran farms and owned zero slaves. The Nazi party claimed aka stole land, assets,etc..that belonged to other people. So after the war, the land was given back to the rightful owners, granted it was probly shot to shit.

Very different than what happened to us. Our family farms were ours , for generations. The Govt took possession of our land, livestock, field hands,etc..

So the US Govt employed the same tactics as the Nazis did. Just roll in with a big fuck you, your shit belongs to us now.Lol..its a line from The Outlaw Josey Wales, when Josey is speaking with the Carpetbagger. I thought I was the only one.  Never used illicit drugs of any sort, yet here I am.  Holy fuckCare about it in terms of history and in an effort to understand where we as a country come from, yeah of course we care about that. A lot of important points in American history came out of it. 

But I'm not going to argue with someone over how something went down over 150 years ago when we have all the facts....and those arguing on one side have a tendency to be apologists for slavery. That I don't care forFile a tax return.No, I am just a cog in wheel. It's a publicly traded entity. We are known as a Blue Chip company � I run  the Mexico/Central America operations. IIRC it was $20k for a seat at his table that night. It came out my personal budget for the year but it was well worth it. Lol I hear you man but to call the civil war "the war of northern aggression" is fucking absurd.I have no desire to argue. I disagree and leave it at that. Eh,  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Never ask how is a G, Content: , ups: 616, downs: 0**Me** “Yo u good right now??”

**Plug** “Yo... I really appreciate you asking, bro- things have been pretty hectic lately what with Nino taking over the old spot. Fiends ain’t payin they tab, neither. It be hurting my feelings dude, for real...”

**Me** *Silence*

**Plug** “And my grandmom, you know I be treating her right, but the other day she call me the wrong name- it kills me to see her fade away like that, she raised me and my sister right like my mama couldn’t.”

**Me** *Silence*

**Plug** “My girl, she aight. Been with me since the beginning, ride or die. Got that birthday round the corner though, you already know she getting that Louis bag. She loyal as fuck, you know? You be that way too...”

**Me** “Wow, thanks. I’m sorry shit’s so wild, I’m just trying to cop a few buns...”This been posted so many times, but it still makes me laugh. Has anyone else had awkward moments of dealers try to be buddies with you? Like, dude you're a nice guy, but I'm trying to get back to my place to get well as soon as possible and I really don't care about hearing what your kid did today.If a dealer wants you to stay for just a little so it doesnt look so bad with people coming in and out i can respect that but most of the time i just want to get my drugs and go home or where ever and enjoy them, i don't like making the drug buying process take any longer than it has to takeShit in my experience it pays to play therapist for a bit...hang around long enough and they go "man here's a bag/pill for sitting here listening to me, i know you need to get well" ...worked for me every time.  

Then again, im a small blond haired blue eyed girl...that might also have something to do with it. Never fucked for drugs tho, never had to. I've forced my friendship on every dealer I've had and it paid off big time for me. I don’t sell weed anymore but I felt this. I used to have some of my best friends stop by after not talking to them for months, and they just want to cop a dub and leave. It’s fucked up. My plug is this younger Mexican guy well I go to his parents house to meet him down the street from mine. His mom always tries to feed me and his dad always Acts super impressed with a little bit of Spanish I know and tries to teach me more, and the plug is always fucking spawn the fuck out on drugs definitely not heroin, he's really into Crystal and girl plus he goes out and drinks every night and he's a champion professional boxer in our area so he's a fucking whole trip on his own. meeting him out and about can be super fucking hectic. But I love going chilling at his Folk's place especially when there is some fucking lengua or some Cabeza braising in a stock pot before it gets fried up on their flat top. Definitely had to go to a lot worse dope spots. I'm actually going to start seeing one of his runners when he gets back out of jail in March. That's who I initially was getting served from but since the plug had seen me running errands and doing a shift for other dope boys and being a tester he didn't mind directly serving me. It's turned out to be totally fuckingawesome is my gram price got cut in half and I never have any cut on my shit. I mean at least from my dude. Legit as fuck old school cartel ties. junkally blessed right nowTell ej he needs to get some friends My guys (both current and past), did not want to hear about my problems. Very kind and friendly people, but it was pretty much straight business. With some people, this is just good pusher/client etiquette. I've done small favors here and there though. I strive to be the ideal client, so I get taken care of promptly when I call and this approach has usually worked. I laughed way too hard at this. But seriously tho. They never ask if a nigga good , they always asks if it's good but they never ask if I'm good �Aw poor EJ.Just because I'm bad guy, does not make me bad guy

That's what this reminds me of for some reasonBTW I’d never of thought this post would get so many upvotes�� right like I got time to hear about nana and Shaquilla purse just give me shit so I can get out the hoodThe scary part is when that convo goes the other way-ur dealer asking if ur ok, you don't look so good, have you eaten lately? And then you just open up, and he's like....yeahhhhh listen i got a few stops to make so....  

That was near the beginning of the end for me �Yo I’m stoned. This king Louis got me reading every word 5 times, and I’m still confused. My dogs are licking my ankles like lil junkies, and I love all y’all. May you all stay safe. ���I know, I still just picture a big ass D boi all in his feels and shit... why deez niqqas never wanna chill no more? Head in hands and what not Lol heartless... no they usually only want my $$ lol but I’ll talk of you coming off a few extra pills and paying for friends Yes and you don't want to hurt his feelings I totally agree w you and I have no issue sitting for 5-10 minutes, I actually usually do that so I’m not running in and out. 

I much rather meet at a store, both grab a pop/soda and make the exchange and walk out... easy peezy Now see there is a difference from forced friendship to a therapist, I have a girl that gets shit all the time and she acts like my BFF, I never remember telling her I had kids but yet she always ask and I’m always like “look not being mean but I have friends “ she not a small hot blonde but either way it wouldn’t matter. It’s all about money now if I’ve known you forever that’s a different story I’ll chill and talk other then that it s“off till the next text”.That's what they all sayYou should write a story. Maybe it becomes a screenplay. You got a grimy ass writing style (from what I felt reading this) that is what I’m always looking for with books and movies. 

Sorry so random I just had to say something. Must be on that Dirty South Coast I’m assuming Damn EJ only started hustling to make friends... yet has no friends Bro there are like 5 classes of junkie, including me I’m just trying to come up w 5 names lol��� right it’s always about them and don’t even ask me how my day is goingI know right poor fella just wants some friends to smoke and chill with, the guy I go to at times actually turned out as a good buddy where now we actually go hang , I’m in his wedding party because no one ever wants to hang w him they want their shit and bounce. I’ve been to his baby shower, family bbq’s usually only white guy there but hey all good. Nah im friends with all my dealers. Smoke blunts and take bumps with acid guy, smoke out my weed guy, im my own ghb and opiate/benzo guy 

Its nice to be friends with dealers. Got 3 tabs of lucy for free and get smoked out alotI agree. I sitting in his house sick and he wants to talk. Let me get straight and then you can blabber. [deleted]Shit I'm so emotional right now for some reason that made me tear up � I'm gonna text my guy right now and bake him some cookies Yes me too, since i shoot i don't like doing it at my dealer's house because he doesnt really like it much so i usually wait til after i leave and stop at the first gas station to do some so i love it when he has me meet him there so that way the whole process is quicker and I'm already where i want to be to get highSee I don't deal with people I don't know, when I have to find a new dealer I ask around and have a friend hook me up. If it's good, you're stuck with me now. So after a month or 2 of seeing you almost every day, we're gonna start to chat. That's just how I am, I'm great with small talk and like to be friendly. So I just always end up forming friendships. Idk if its just me or what, but I've heard so many times "i don't usually let people come to the house like this", I'll get invited to parties or whatever. My last dealer was cartel, and he told me once he doesn't even sell to users like me in the small amounts I'd get, but I was always on time and he liked me. Dude had a serious gf too and we all became good friends, it wasn't like he was trying to bang. He just...liked me lol. 

In contrast would be a friend of mine that hops on some app every time he wants to pick up. He doesn't keep people's numbers or establish relationships, just quick deals with whoever is around. That is sketch af to me and just increases the chances of getting set up. He was always scamming people too, like if he linked up with some tiny dude he would just take the bag and hop out the car without paying...imo he was doing a lot of work for a small amount of free shit, where as I put in a little bit of friendliness and got a junkies dream in return. Being welcome at a house that never had less than 5k m boxes at a time was my personal heaven. If I didn't want to pay I just had to chill long enough (read 30 mins) to be offered some.  

Edit: im always vocal about having a boyfriend too, whether i actually do or not. For me it set the vibe that im not a trap ho, and don't fuck for drugs. Lol what do you mean??Hey random redditor, I really appreciate that. My mom and therapist both tell me I should write bc they like what I put out, but you're the first person who's told me that outside of people who are obliged to love and support me lol.  

Thank you. It means a lot. True gratitude and appreciation for others are things I get to enjoy now that I'm sober, so thank you for that. That's sweet, I respect that.Yea I was being sarcastic, I’m friends w my pill dude and his dad lol... they both will undercut each other it actually funny as hell. It took a little time but worth it cuz he will grab pandas for me without asking and just text me wholesale prices.Lol I know aint no one on here smoking blunts and taking dumps, but that's what I read. I think I may be dyslexic or some shit.Metro where you been blood? I haven’t seen you in a minute my niqqa... Every time I see my mom. 

“You’ve got a nasty cough going on. Are you ok?”

“Yea it’s just that time of the year again” 

“Here. This essential oil blend helps strengthen and clean your lungs out. It’s not cheap though.”Damn I need custo’s that bake me cookies, glad I could make ya laugh.

Happy New Year be safe!!!

I done already F’ed up 2019 but 2020 is all meYea I see your point and I’ve formed friendships like that it’s just not really me as I know THOTS that think me saying “you’re welcome “ means I wanna bang when really I’m just thanking them for driving extra or whatever. I just have always been business is business.. I don’t front, I don’t wanna hear about lil Johnny hitting a T-Ball home run or your hubby is jealous blah blah..
I do get what you are saying as I have great relationships a my main plugs... First off you are welcome. When reading your comment I was imagining your brief post as if I was watching it on screen. I’m very much into film/movies (whichever you prefer calling them), so that’s probably why. I think it would be very interesting and you should definitely tap into that skill you have. Finding what you’re good at is hard sometimes. Good luck, friend. Hey the Dboi is human like us, I get where they are coming from, some ppl I hook up I don’t wanna be friends at all it’s all business.. shit most don’t even know my real name nor will they. Thats whats up man. Back when i was selling clam double stacks i saw a customer at work going to heroin W/D and just gave her keys to my car to grab a barHaha i hope the hell not. We take *bumps* aka shove powder in the noseI always gotta dump when i bump cokeI am on furlough so my money is really tight. [deleted]I bake my guy a batch of cookies twice a month! He deserves it :) I'd send you some as well if I knew how!

Happy New Year, love, and you too!

You didn't fuck up, it's the first couple of days! You have the rest of the year to make it your year and it IS your year! Make 2019 your bitch!And I see your point too, business is business and 95% of clients are just that, clients. I realize that I am not your typical user in that sense, but I've found that forming relationships with people who regularly have good drugs is more beneficial than just keeping it strictly business. I hear all the time that I'm abnormally easy to open up to...my background is in psych and counseling, and it comes easily for me. So it's never awkward, like if the guy has that attitude of not trying to hear about "lil johnny hitting a home run" then I'll drop it and no hard feelings. Its just that I rarely get that reaction, so an organic friendship tends to form.  

I've had friends who complain about the dealer wanting them to stay and chill for a few mins (you know the type, worried about people being in and out makes it look like a traphouse), complain like "dude im just here for my shit i dont wanna chill". And i don't get it, like usually we're sitting there getting high on the dealers shit while i wait for 30 mins to pass so I can leave. I've always got time for free drugs, idk why people complain about that shit lol. Yea I guarantee she was a loyal customer too for life, I take care of my ppl I deal with just no time for talk talk talk to everyone... not enough timeLol yeah I got that after like the 5th time I re-read it. The thought conjured the image of two dudes passing a blunt under the bathroom sall. Lol that's something more than friendship right there.MAGA �Sorry to hear that I just had emergency surgery in my eye so I’ve pretty much been on restrictions ... have to sit in dark rooms, no driving, no work... good to hear from you homie... hoping you a happy safe new year my friend Correct. 

No joke tho, that shit burns. I accidentally got residue on my hands and rubbed my eyes and they looked like I got maced. Lol I was just joking about 2020 I saw a post on FB earlier that made me lmao so figured I would use it here.

I mean I accept cookies all year around if you are offering.Lol who doesn’t like free drugs? I don’t have NO ONE come to my house, I have a few places that are just meeting spots A/B/C and know the owners of the business and I own a business so makes it easy, but different strokes for different D bois Hey check your PM.. I asked a question and want a woman’s outlook on itMuch Respect man. My benzo and opiate guy OD’d not too long ago (very very close friend) and I learned to appreciate those guys much more than I should. A lot of them were forced into living that life. I always bring food like a medium pizza or wings or even just fucking fresh toritillas (since I’m Mexican) or something. I never expect anything in return, ever. I just wish I would’ve done things like that for my late friend. Respect to all the Gs out there doing their thing keeping their people grounded. This is r/opiates. None of us take dumpsThx. Lol I wanna see this post now! 

And absolutely! I'm the cookie queen of the south!RIP to your friend man I’m sorry to hear that. 

You would think dealers wouldn’t be giving shit to ppl they don’t know what it is (fent pills) but this game is so F’ed up out here you just don’t know. I only buy from a few guys as I’ve known them 10+ years and I will literally take them to get their scripts so I know it’s from the pharmacy not that I don’t trust my ppl but I like to see for myself.That's why I kept re-reading it lol. I knew that couldn't be what he meant.[2020](https://imgur.com/a/k3kfoIP) Hold on I’ll send it to ya...Hahahaha that made my night, thank you so much for that � I felt that way at 12:01am on New year's [deleted]Lol- that is 2 times today I’ve made your day.

Unfortunately I had emergency surgery the Friday before the NYE so I was home in bed restWhat is real shit? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Found a girl’s credit card stuck in the ATM...taught her a lesson, Content: Man I spent so much money on it. I mean I had a field day. I bought a TV, an Xbox, and a new laptop. Dumb bitch shoulda been more careful.
Taught her a lesson.....


Just kidding.


I looked up her name on Facebook, messaged her and verified she was who she said she was like appearance of card, middle initial, etc. Then I drove back into town (about 30mi) and gave her back her card. She was very thankful and pleased. I taught her the lesson that there are good people out there.  Even if she didn’t know that i was, drug addicts are capable of being decent and moral people.



Why I posted this is because we all make choices everyday. I coulda hit a lick on this girl to go get some meds, but I didn’t because I decided to make the morally correct decision. I also thought about all the shitty things that people have done to me and I didn’t want to pass on that hurt. When I met up with her, she assumed that her card was already screwed up and that she was going to be broke. Instead, I proved that there are still good people out here in this fucked up world. 



Before I met her, I went and got meds with my own money. Money that I was holding on to that I didn’t need to spend but better me be broke to fund my habit than a girl who just so happened to leave her card somewhere. I went and picked up 6 30s. 



All I’m saying is strive to be better. I know we all do shit we’re not proud of as addicts but also, we can hustle without fucking others over and treat others with respect. Ya feel me? 



Have a good night opifam🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤



EDIT: WOAH! I just woke up from a nod (3:25am my time) and I have 130 upvotes currently! Jesus Christ! I feel the love guys! Stay safe out there. I’ll respond to comments tomorrow. I think I’m going to try to sleep off the rest of the night now. See you in a few hours!



EDIT EDIT: I got gold?!?!? And 350+ upvotes! I never imagined! I just thought I’d get a discussion going about doing decent things as addicts!    Holy shit! Thank you to whoever spent their money on me! I don’t deserve it! 


Ok, now to address the people who are being hateful (I mean it wouldn’t be the internet without them right?).  All the people saying “you would’ve stolen the shit if you would’ve been sick.” Uh no, I wouldn’t have. That’s not cool. I know this game can make people lose empathy for others but that’s something I hold on to. I’ve probably had 8,000 stolen from me since I started my addiction. I’m more careful now, but I’m still empathetic to others. In fact, I think going to trap houses seeing little kids walking around in dirty clothes and dirty diapers has made me try harder to be a better man. Everyone needs a moral code. I think all you angry folks need to re-evaluate and put a moral code in your heart. 


Thank you everyone! Much love!, ups: 617, downs: 0I missed the “just kidding” part so for a second I thought you hit a lick on her then drove out to return it to her lmao I was like damn that’s savageAround here a lot of atms won't even give you the money until you take the card.Respect. Should be more people like this out there. Know and believe I would do the same thing. You should have told her "btw I'm an addict you coulda lost bigtime. bye now" lol    


good for you OP I have a similar story about a wallet I found on the ground while I was in treatment, I was trying to get into a room on night for yoga.  The room was just being used for a Cocaine Anon meeting by outside people, and being the first person into the room after they left I found it on the ground.  It had enough paper to be like $200 I thought, and everything else you'd find in there.  I just went and found the group about to walk off our hospital floor and found him. It feels good to do that shit, but if found that wallet like 2 weeks earlier I wouldn't have done that. Even two weeks later, nope.  That's pretty much the only story I have as an adult of finding cash on the ground, hahaWas behind a guy late one night at an atm. He pulled away and he left his $300 in the tray , and his card in still.  I wasn't going to chase a guy down at high speed at 3am..so. I did call his bank to cancel the card thoughThis is such a good lesson. Life is hard for everyone we gotta work togetherThat’s cool you gave her card back. Not sure what I would have done in that situation. 

But, can I add something?

If you didn’t have money for your “6 30’s”, would you have done the same thing?r/wholesomejunkiesI do think this broad was dead wrong for not even throwing you gas money to come all the way back out to meet her. Sounds self entitled like a mother fucker to me. Me being the broke bitch that I am most of the time, ALWAYS tips very well, ALWAYS makes it worth someone's while when they go outta their way for me whether impromptu or not. I never assume people have the time and money to run around for me. Good on you for not being a filthy thief.  I do honestly believe our habits should inconvenience no one but ourselves, but hopefully JJ blesses you to make up for what that broad with the card should have done. I'm betting you were too chickenshit to run wild with itI woyld of fucking had a field day with that Thank you for being an awesome person. Great storyThere are still good people in the world! ��������
That was an awesome thing to do.  ❣️�LameThe consensus in this sub always seems to be, “getting well justifies anything immoral it may take to get there and fuck you for making me feel bad about it.” 

Before anyone yells at me to get off my high horse, I should say that, yes, I’ve stolen plenty. But it’s not impossible to make an effort so that those we’re taking from aren’t as damaged or set back by it. 

Instead of taking your family’s gold, why not shoplift from a giant corporation? Open bank accounts to overdraft like a motherfucker? 

Because yeah, please excuse the fuck out of me for thinking you’re an asshole if you take your mom’s engagement ring without an ounce of remorse. This isn’t an irreversible judgement though. I can respect someone that at least feels bad about it in retrospect. But to those thinking you’re *entitled* to drag others down to fuel your addiction, well, yeah, you are kind of an asshole. The stereotypes shouldn’t inform your personal conception of morality. If someone ghosts on me cuz I fronted $40 I don’t think, “it’s fine, he’s addicted.” No. Fuck that person. 

We’ve all done scummy shit. But let’s not pretend there aren’t other hustles that can be found either. That laziness or unwillingness to hustle in more “considerate” ways is what irks me. You *do* deserve to incur the risk of shoplifting or whatever the fuck else, it’s not your family that deserves to be taken advantage of. It’s like snitching. You wanna play criminal, well eat the consequences too, don’t rat on others because plea deal

In OPs situation, I would’ve researched the credit card to see if fraud protection was part of the plan. If so? Cha ching. If not? If she has high ass APR cuz the credit score is shit, it’s gonna feel like stealing from a bum. Am I perfect? Fuck no. Clearly. But let’s at least stop pretending this shit is totally fine because muh addicshen i gotta short this kid waaah Had you wouldve been broke and dope sick then what? Hey man I’m glad you did the right thing I mean really that shows and takes a lot of not only will power but shows your morality in this ....

THAT BEING SAID lemme just be blunt and honest with you here....

If this was a slow day or 2 for a habit sick as dog getting the last 10 out to hopefully pitch with somebody and get a half 30 to just feel somewhat off empty can you honestly say you would do the same ?

Be real man I’m not expecting a no or a yes just be real with it would you of taken at least another 20 to get a whole 30/15 whatever you prefer?And she didn’t even give you money? Like 20 or 50euro?? You drove all the way to her place, and for what? I Would feel bad if I were you..This is how everything could always be with legalization.This is such an amazing post. Thank you for showing the world the good. Your drug use does not define whether or not you’re or a good person, your actions like these do. You are a good person, this was a very kind thing that must’ve taken up a lot of your time but still, you did it. Thanks for sharing this great thing you did ❤️ I'm a super, also found someone's card left in the ATM a few weeks ago. I knocked on the door of the back until a man cake up to me said he was waiting for his wife to finish closing up the bank. I have him the card and he got his wife to come out and grab it. I also could have had a field day but I was taught better.Found one the other day walking home... Pin written on the back and it was the owner of a local restaurant so there was probably a decent amount on it.

Gave it back and they were happy.Well if you did it I bet you would have gotten locked up FAST. All ATMs have cameras. She simply reports the time used, they trace the time on the ATM and you're a convicted felon in a few months.

But you're a better man than I. If i was sick id.probably take.my chances and run her dry.How could you have screwed her over without her pin number aside from ordering things online. How would you have gotten cash out of the ATM?Good on you man for showing that all addicts don't steal and rob people.   What goes around comes around and I wish you well.   Be safe and keep your head upGood stuff OP, good karma headed your way. ��I wouldn't dare risk ruining my clean record by going to town on a tap n go card if I found one unless I knew I wouldn't be caught. I'm in Aus and know people who've been followed up and traced pretty easily using cards they've foundGood on ya homie. I try to practice the same principles as an opioid dependent person and it warms my heart knowing others do as well. Have a good one and keep being awesome!But did ya fuck er An absolute king
.Sorry life has not quite brought you to where you deserve to be by now,but It will.Usually you need to put the pin in again if their first transaction is done. Also they could have been recording you so possibly avoided jail time.Honestly I am a good person I have always worked to fund my habit, still get up work when I am dope sick but come on.. are you even a real drug addict? This reminds me of the stories of little kids turning in thousands of dollars to the police when they find it lol. I call this being a sucker. And she didn't even give u anything.. just think, she is a shitty person to not even throw u $20 or something. Now that is straight up ignorant and that's a fact.r/thathappenedOne time I was on my way down to the city to cop and I was texting while I had my card in the atm and I didn't click anything fast enough and it ate it... I was flipping out . But luckily i was able to open the front of the machine and saw where it was sitting inside . I think there was another one there too. TD bankWholesome I didnaame 400 quid in hambag left in cominalmarea not even a thanks like I'd stole the cubit obviously took to long to find out it was hersI was so scared for a sec, ya got me![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF2P-hLAZZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF2P-hLAZZ4) <3I am so proud of you fam! Good work!!Good on you! Was nervous at first but glad I read the rest. It seems that some people didn’t see that you said just kidding. I'm NOT hating but you're going to tell me if it had been 2 days since a hit and no money you wouldn't take any? I dont buy that under no circumstances would you take it. You're funds are good so you're not an ass hole. That's good. Some people are an ass regardless.You know, you could have done all that, AND sold that info to Russians?! That way you're still being a good person, and making money, and also being a complete dick!

Come no, whatever happened to being chaotically neutral in life?!  :(I'm proud of you. You are one of the good ones.Awesome. Funny thoughr, I know plenty of sober people who would have taken that card and had a field day. It's a shame that it happens. I'm glad that there was a happy ending though.  she would of got lickedIf u do not have boundaries, then u will truly b lost. It is so much harder to come back from tht. And we all dream of a day when we will come back. Even tho she did not know, ty for repping the good side of ur opifam. Oh, and.. never surrender!From a fellow dope fiend...amen . Blessings to you. I'm SO tired of society demonizing addicts.I had posted a while ago what I did when I was in this exact same situation a while ago (the opposite of what you did) and I got absolutely destroyed on here. I was about to be like, "see, I'm not the only one..."Man. Way to wreck a preconception. I am disappoint. Well nice job doing the nice thing. ��You are a beautiful human being. We need more stories like yours.After reading this I came to a conclusion. You, my friend, are not a REAL drug addict. Junkie scum like my self would have ran that shit into the ground!You would’ve been caught sooner or later While reading this the only thing i could think of was how hot was she? Did you at least try get her number or nah?**God Bless You :) <3**could have saved me 15 seconds reading that dribble. What the hell is wrong with everyone on this sub just break it onto 2 and put it in the bin. Can't believe people are patting you on the back for being normalNah man. I don’t play like that.  The just kidding is very important. HahahaHAHAHA! That would be savage as shit!! Lol. You did same thing I would have done. I would have turned it in...but I would have been hoping for a little kick down! :PYeah I know what you mean. Apparently, she was depositing cash into the ATM after work and forgot to hit “finish” which would’ve told her to remove her card. When I pulled up to the ATM, her bank account was wide open. I hit cancel. Then it asked if I wanted to withdraw and I hit cancel again, then it prompted to remove card.


She said she had a rough evening (she’s a waitress so she was dumping her tips in the bank) and that she’s so glad a decent person found it because she would’ve been completely broke if someone would’ve taken all that money out.Yooo Kyuss is dope!  


I caught them at Hellfest like 8 years ago.

&#x200B;

I saw Electric Wizard and Kylesa too.

&#x200B;

Shit was beyond insane. Electric Wizards set was surreal, like giant crowd swaying as one, I had no drugs but legit felt high as fuckAll Chase ATM's are like that where I live.GoodThe one I use beeps at you and if you dont take it within 10 seconds or so it sucks it up. Without a pin it's useless if it's just an atm card So you did keep the money then, right? Exactly what I said...Yea it all depends on the circumstances, this specific one I would return the card cause id  already b caught cause of cameras, but, if he randomly found a wallet, he’d run that bitch up no doubt about it.  It all depends on how much self awareness and knowledge each person has. Most of the time, junkies have little to none, that’s why they do dumb shit and get caught, giving them and everybody else a bad name. Now they’re are junkies who aren’t dumb at all and are perfectly functional. Apparently, they deserve the bad name in this modern society unfortunately, but whatever’s, everybody gets categorized no matter who they are. The one question that is on everyones mindThe one question that is on everyones mindWhy should someone be rewarded for doing something they are supposed to do? I think you just don't have much of a moral compass. It really shows.that's what I'm thinking too bro-sif/r/nothingeverhappensWhat language is this?Nope. I would’ve done everything in my power to not do it. I know it’s hard to believe that there are good people out here but there are. If I absolutely had no money, no meds, i would rather pawn my shit than to steal from a hard working woman who was so tired that she left her card in an ATM. I’m broke a lot and I’m dopesick a lot so I know how it is with money. Sometimes, you have it. Sometimes, you don’t.I prefer to stay in the chaotic good category �Gatekeeping addiction. Classy.No, you're just scum.  Junkies can have morals.  Don't put everyone in the same category as you just to justify your shitty behaviors.Ya sounds like you’re already just a piece of shitNo you’re just a piece of shit. Dude, shut up. I was addicted to drugs and I never stole shit. If I was withdrawing then I would just go to work and not make my problems other people's problems. There is a difference between being an addict and being a piece of shit. I'm sure you would do a bunch of horrible shit to keep your addiction going and it's people like you who give addicts a bad name. You really shouldn't be bragging about this...Before you put him in the category of a saint realize that he did what he did for the same reason all people do to get that great feeling inside of doing the right thing which in its essence can be seen a selfish. The ones that do good and don't brag or tell others about it are the real ones. I knew a guy that would give homeless people up to 100 dollars at a time, and he never told a soul about his good deeds or bragged to anyone about it. Let's be honest if he was dopesick as fuck would he have done the same?Idk why all the thumbs down. All atms have cameras on them and he even said her shit was on the screen so they would easily know who took the money out of her account.Not really. I know a few family members who’ve had their cards scanned at restaurants and the people who scanned the card took the info to Walmart and made off with around $1k (it’s happened about 3 times to friends and family) each time. None of them were caught. Exactly. Find an envelope full of cash with a name and address on it, return it, then toot your own horn. Are you 12?Why does that matter? One could quite easily have clicked back. Oh, and it's drivel r/boneappletea found the edgy teenagerGosh, everyone hates you.Bone apple tea my friendI think you mean "drivel", Iverson.Lol what did you dribble on?Kylesa!! I saw them in N*shville in 2005 and it was awesome, so was being 15 seeing kylesa hahaI'd give anything to see Ewiz. I just imagine a horde of people droning so hard. Kyuss and Electric Wizard at one fest definitely sounds worth the price of admission. 

Seems like I've watched some sets on YouTube from that specific Hellfest, now that I'm thinking about it. The jealousy did flowHellfest? Which hellfest are you referring to?Yup..Who cares? I don’t read comment replies so I couldn’t know..He’s NOT supposed to do that. Everybody knows “finders keepers,” he’s going against that doctrine to boost his own morals and dignity. He did a great deed and that’s why it is a deed, because he wasn’t supposed to do shit, he could have kept that shit and not think about th consequences she would have went through and the benefits for his self. But, the good man did the RIGHT thing most definitely. Yeah, except no. This guy obviously didn't haven't the balls to use the card, justified it to himself as 'I'm just a nice guy' and then posted here for affirmation, which you then gave him. The fact that you even have things to pawn makes me feel like you havent "seen" the shit I have. My addict career lasted 15 years. I only had a bank account and stuff I could pawn the first 4 years or so. No offense I absolutely commend you. But it doesnt matter if your mr Roger's or jesus him self, your brain rewires itself. Give it a few more years. You're not desperate enough....yet. I did unthinkable things towards the end of my using cAreer, things that haunt me to this day. I'm sure you feel like you've been around the block plenty and have as much experience as anyone else. But I can promise you. Even the best of us will steal to feed our addiction when all other avenues have been exhausted. You just said I'd pawn first. You said you had a car. Well yeah I did too. When I had a car and a job and lived at home and had extra money and was still tethered to reality, but a fea short years later everything changed. Theres a lot of people in here with nothing left to pawn, no car, their taking public transpo. So before you get on here preaching about how holy you are for returning a most likely un usable card anyways.  I think you should consider your addiction.  Its apples to oranges man.  You think the average heroin addict has a car a license and pays insurance? You say "there are some good addicts out here" yeah were not demon spawn until the end and were ready to off ourselves dealing with this shit. I didnt like this soap box post much.If you "knew a guy" then you're post means nothing. Somehow you found out. If you're the actual homeless recipient, then how do you know he told no-one? And finally, if you're the actual guy who gave the money, then why are you bragging?  I could go on, but I'll stop there. You're not worth my selfishness.Not if he had gone into a store with glasses and a hoodie and gotten cash back just saying if there's a will there's a wayYour right in the grand scheme of things it matter's not the least, and is not the purpose of the story whatsoever. But if she was attractive it could have worked out for him maybe he could of scored? I mean what better way to prove character than to do what he did.  2011 I believe, in clisson France.

Used to be a festival in New Jersey im pretty sure What a douche bag. Simply agreeing with you"Finders keepers"? Are you twelve?You seem super nice.I am not preaching anything, man. And I’m not going to get into a “who’s a bigger junkie” contest like l’ve seen in rehab or AA meeting. Some people just handle their shit differently. I’ve been doing this shit for almost 8 years now. My original post even says that I’ve done shit I’m not proud of BUT I think we as addicts and as humans in general can do better. You feel me? That’s what is resonating with people. That’s why people are upvoting. I don’t want the spotlight on me, i just want people to be good. Fair?Bro not everyone is as weak as you. Believe it or not there are some dopers out there who were raised much much better than this lifestyle suggests, and we tend to accept the dt's as paying to play. I in fact have been called a masochist for letting myself go straight into dope sickness. My only rule is as long as my choices w.drugs don't directly or indirectly effect pplvi care about it's all "good". Some of us can handle it...and yes you don't need to tell me I wasnt doing enough I was and sometimes still do. Your story may reflect the majority, but some of us understand that your going to suffer for choosing to use the drug. Know ahead of time and plan to fight through a few days of insanity.Go shoot up your dope buddy your stupid ass acts like I havent been thru every stage. Including the stage where you think you've got it under control. Like you do. Your only hope is stoppingNo i was with with said person when he gave the homeless guy 100 bucks like it was nothing. And never have i once heard him tell anyone or brag to anyone about it, when i told many people he was close to about it they didn't know of it and when i asked him if he told anyone about it his exact words were " That's not why i did it" That my friend is what i call REAL character. Out of the conclusions i don't see how you came to the other two which are least likely, must be all the drugs fucking up your brain.New York. Well it was a few yrs in NJ. That’s the one I was wondering if you were referring to. i know right?!Oh sorry, I took it the wrong way. Thought you meant that my comment was useless cause I was repeating what you said and that It annoyed you. English is not my main language. Sorry buddyLol i might be , and im pretty sure everybody else when it comes to that. If the owner is nowhere to b found wtf r u going to do about it? Leave it there? I doubt it g, quit playing yourself fair enough man. Mad props, brother.. I agree 100%,fuck being judged as all the same, etc... I been doing H daily for 6+ years with my wife, at minimum $40 to $75 per day.. I'm early 40s,in younger years spent decades in and out of prison and rehab (for trafficking, and rehab for hardcore alcoholism)my first treatment was 23 years ago, so Im obviously not no rookie or "haven't hit bottom yet " type person! I've been to the point sleeping in a car (no keys)in 20 below weather, and desperately ripping my beercans with a knife to eat the ice cause they keep freezing up in my hand.. I don't care what anybody says, that more then qualifys as a bottom to me! Today I can't stand the taste of beer, alcohol, buy a top shelf bottle of tequila 2-3 times a year, do 3 shots and give rest away.. I just woke up one morning and realized you couldn't pay me a $50 bill on my brokest day to chug a beer, I don't know what the f happened, but I love it and proud of myself.. first male in family to not die from cirrhosis, for real! My worse day on heroin is blessed compared to my best day drinking, I honestly believe alcohol is 1000% more dangerous, debilitating and life wreaking then any other drug (notcounting shit like salts/flacca, etc).. I have burned bridges, and reluctantly run scams, shit I hated myself for, never for my dopesickness, but for my wife's sickness.. long story, but  withdrawal,( 12+ hrs and on)is tremdousley life threatening for her,in several ways, on top of her underlying conditions, and many of you guys would be ashamed of your definition of sickness if you glimped what happens to her .. fortunately, I've got myself established and into the habit nowadays of never not having at least a few subs stashed,go months without needing to touch em,(a G lasts us at minimum 4 days and change, between the 2 of us) never crossed my mind to pick up a needle, never had, never would..we  snort only, everyday , since 2012 ish.. gossippy family members have actually wandered up to us and exclamed"geee, everybody bs about us being bad on H, so how come in 8 years ,never hear about us overdoseing , even dieing, like everyone else associated with h around here is.. basically it's because same connect for last 5 years, she buys so much at once that the type only changes 1 to 3 times per year. Talk about bulk.. always do testers when quality changes, and always make wife wait by me for 20+ mins when I do the tester, before I let her touch it.. I couldn't imagine letting my additcion worsen today, fuck self pity, I got tired of waiting to get back with a sub doc, or both not ready or able to quit immediately, so just give up? Well fuck that, I'm gonna get a head start on my goals, fiancial, relationship, even education wise, instead of letting haters win, I declared "who the fuck made all those rules  that  I'm helpless, lowlife, circling the drain piece of shit? "Well fuck that, instead of letting my earlier in life AA experiences brainwash my life, I decided that even if it's true when idiots say success is impossible while useing, so be it, I'll be the first one then.. (OMG, Adderall make me type insane, lol) circling around to the subject of this thread, never in a million years would I take her card for my habit, but I would take that card in a heartbeat to save wifeys life.. their are other circumstances that vary my opinions, if it was a rich Republican country club type that looks at my brand new Jordans in disgust as I pay in line with food stamp card, I would be grateful to take that disrespectful assholes card for new clothes, shoes, even jewelry for wife.. Oh yea, btw, I was born in the hood, inner city, bred and still live here, except when in prison never left.. we are far from comfy, live "check to check" and I have always delt coke and pills and occasionally H for income, just enough to keep our heads above water, and shop for things we need/want... Hardcore addict here, but there is a pair of shoes and watch I'm actively saveing up for, even in the throes of addiction... Flat out, guys, stop letting things define you, and if not going your way, fuck suffering just because so called peers keep telling you that there is no other option.. peace out , my friends, and no offense in advance.. I don't give a fuck if I'm not liked, I'm used to haters hatein all my life cause I also have a serious physical disability, but still got helova game, and people cants stand that on so many levels, you know?? He apologized. So we good. 

The English language is a mother fucker sometimes. I forgive you �
I meant no disrespect. Maybe I should have used the lame reddit lingo and typed "same". 
I appreciate the apology, that is a rarity around here. Take care friend, be safe. You sound like a wonderful guy/SSorry that my brain chemistry’s been changed caused by years of downer usage Mine too and I'm not a dick. Hmm.Hmm I guess your automátically a better person than I am :) pat yourself on th back bro and do whatever u can do keep your boat floating and don’t get off th high horse , cause dicks’ like me will knock u tf offf!!! LOLLol you sound pathetic and like you have a serious inferiority complex. You probably drag people down because you hate yourself. This is why you either have few friends or shitty ones. Hope you get better. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Guilty🤷🏻‍♂️, Content: , ups: 617, downs: 0He’s good he gets 90% of my paycheckWhen my dude got locked up (it was only got like a week) I got in contact with him to see if there was anything I could do to help him out. There definitely wasn't, but he remembered that when he got out. He was always good at what he does, but since then I'm getting like an entirely new level of customer service.

Sometimes it pays to see how the dopeman is doing. Sad lol
Maybe because he makes us wait like 2 hours and he has money and drugs so he’s gotta be fine lolHad to be a Blackman huh �Laughed then showed my boyfriend he goes “cuz nobody cares “

He might be part of the problem lolEverybody ask the dealer ‘yo , you good yet?’ But nobody ask the dealer ‘yo , are YOU good though?’ 
LmaoThis a pic of Tyler the Creator?This reminds me of Omar “Hey man you around, I’ll smoke you out if your tryna chill?”Actually I was always good friends with the dopemanI always ask how's the dopeman! Dopeman has feelings too.Cause most of they time they are lying, bull shit artists who would dime their own mother out if need beSame meme was posted a few weeks ago smhToo real WordI put $ on my guys books while he was in, and I guess word got around cause other dope dealers also treated me like a king. Dude got life, so I’ll never really mess with him again, but I really felt for him.God, the waiting. Fuck having to wait���� I’m from the west coast so most of my bth connects were Mexican or white. But the picture was just too good.Idk about where you live but mid Atlantic probably 90% of connects I know are black, but most users are white. Funny thing is they're probably the smart ones for not touching it so it's not like it's a racist thingJust stay on deck thats all I care about lol.I’m not really sure but it looks like his sad lookin ass.Its kodak black on a morning radio show called the breakfast club. Look up the interview on youtube he's fucked up the whole time. [removed][deleted]You’d be surprised at how many dealers also are users but don’t want their customers knowing.

It’s better business if you don’t actually know what’s going on in their lives. Some people and I had mutual dealers before we met, and when I mentioned I’d done dope with X dealer before they just go “holy shit I’ve known them for 10 years and they always acted like they’d never touch that shit” or something along the lines of it.

If not, good chance they’re popping other opiate pills.

Then of course there are a ton of dealers that don’t use, so I don’t know why I even made this post.And dont tell me 10 minutes when its gonna be 30, we good!!Lol I kno we was on your team for 5 years. It’s true ... we didn’t care how we were and no one else did either I'm like 90% sureFucked up on what? [removed][removed][deleted]Fuck 10 min right around the corner. 3 hours later can you meet me across town. 
It’s nice when you have options and can tell them to fuck off. But their always on time at first even kick you down an extra point or two. That all goes out the window once they know their your only plug.30? That would be fast for my guy. I call him 4-5 hours before I need anything No idea, but you can just tell he aint in the right mind. Id guess lean or some shit. [removed]Specific locations aren't allowed here.

/u/NorthBayPsychonaut /u/synthetic_opioids310Checks post history, sees exactly 0 pics of you ever getting a zip. You do seem very young though (under 21) and new to the game (got your first ever ball of tar about a month ago, already bragging about getting zips, constantly wondering if this is the life you want, still taking acid and other drugs p.s. eventually all those other drugs won’t matter cause your money will be for dope only). Please do not think I am bashing you, that is the last thing I would do: I started using at 16 and continued to do so for 10 years.

I was a dealer, so I guess my life was quite a bit easier than most (assuming your position is pretty similar) and I just wanna let you know eventually you will lose the game. Or at least, eventually the game won’t be worth playing anymore but you’ll realize you signed a much longer contract than you wanted.

I know I would’ve never taken my own advice, but I still feel obligated to give it: get out of the dope game. I don’t mean don’t use dope / opiates cause that’s somewhat unreasonable for an internet stranger to even suggest, but just cut back on all the “other life” stuff and try to actually live a somewhat normal life, use when you have extra money and a strong desire to use. It won’t be fun anymore if you’re using everyday, and when you finally wake up from the haze you won’t even really remember the fun times because it was a chemically induced feeling that you would now be feeling the damages from (you just won’t be the “old” you anymore, and you will constantly wonder what “life could have been like if only...”

I know we can’t stop people from joining our dark side, but don’t go balls deep into it to where your whole life revolves around “the game” / that lifestyle. It only makes it harder to eventually get out of your mental prison. And trust me: eventually you’ll beg for a taste of “a somewhat normal, maybe even one you would had considered boring, life”Hahahaha. My guy is Spanish and literally always says "10 mins" then you call him in 10 mins and he says, "less than 10 mins" and shows up 15 mins later� I'm in a big city so across town is usually only a few exits away. They dont like to stray far lolYeah after ten years I having my dboys apologizing to me and beggin for my biz (60k a yr)

I won the game bitches!

Never have only one connect and never have only several connects but all from the same operation 

My latest one just decided once I took my business elsewhere that he’d try to force me to come back (didn’t pan out well�)
THEN he lowers the price I been arguing with him on to my preferred amount, drives halfway to meet me, and is early not just on time 
Oh, and the counts are better even at th lower price 


He know if he fucks up one more time (left me 3 days in a row with no notice or temp boy) he done Yeah where I'm from like an hour away from where I am now, it's a real small town and my face is good everywhere so I have so many options. It sucks coming here and only having 1 person i van go to by myself.It just took me an hour and a half. Like literally just got good. But I also live 45 mins away. He said 11 and it's now 11:40 so not too bad Ew that blows
And not too bad; raise ya standards! They need you! They make damn sure u don’t know it but they do[removed]...and everyone clapped and got clean.Do u still use or na?That is some fucking great customer service. I only have one dealer that is honest about time.Damn 4shoThe post never said get clean, I never even recommended it lol All my other guys I have to go to a trap, so I just pull up 24/7 and there's someone there at any time. I love it.Hella hella hella brahYa, one unexpected day you’ll be at the wrong trap at the wrong time. You’ll most likely get to go home that day. But it still won’t be fun. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: are shooting videos wanted or allowed on this sub, Content: , ups: 614, downs: 0I wish I could like this...I'd watch lolYea if it's a clean register and hit, don't upload vids of you poking around and having a hard time thoDamnit why can't I like??

What the fuck Omw to get it homieFuck if you say so I willThanks bro! Appreciated. Insomnia is killing me. I took my meds, 1 am and it’s 3 now. Just came out to kitchen to smoke a cig.
Thank you! Every reply is my motivation!Thanks bro! I had a hell of a night! Wouldn’t wish even for an enemy. wat I mean I guess this isnt the same drug but I used diclazepam at 40-50mg equiv to diazepam and still barely could catch a nod lol my eyes were a bit cross eyed but stillThat’s only equal to 2.5mg alprazolam man, but yeah my benzo tolly is quite high.. I’m prescribed pills for pain so I’m still technically using opiates I just don’t get high anymore (besides weed)and tag nsfw if you wouldn’t mind, that way I’ll have to click into it to actually see itYeah, and the kid would've been pimped out. No I was saying what the other guy said. That he’d have already pawned it for oxy money.  I don't find the latter interesting at all, just as I wouldn't find someone snorting stuff interesting, but if they allow shooting posts, then whatever, it's definitely better than memesIt ended up being 10 minutes of me finding the vein, shooting a little, then losing the vein and having to find it again lmao. I'll have to do my first one later since I got some sleep and they're all fresh now.:(she wanted to do it herself. we basically had to plead with her to finally let us intervene /r/nocontextMy nigga You try getting sleep meds from a doc? If not that melatonin and unisom are nice... unless you’re already doing thatGood for you, that's always good to hear. tag me I love needle porn bro What a brainiac. You already know. Four days dry, it's bout to get gnarly. I got it from the dec who prescribed whole withdrawal process and very strong one and Not only the sleeping meds.  Still I have to redose most of the times. Drugs what ever I was on has the worst and the longest  withdrawals and sleep comes in months:(I hear ya. Even “normal” insomnia is bad enough. Adding WDs or even psychological cravings is enough to drive you bonkers. IDK if you've tried it, but seroquel has always knocked me the fuck out. Some people say it makes them groggy the next morning but I never experienced that. Good luck and congrats, 28 days is fucking awesome!I had one of the worst nights. I was just wondering around the living room until 6 am, almost unconscious from meds, but not able to sleep and sometime after 6am i fell asleep on one of the sofas. I wouldn’t wish this shit to my enemy.Seroquel is not an option in this country. But I have have a combo of several strongest prescription meds that I take before bed around, but last 3 days in  were the worst. Almost same as the withdrawals peak days that I had. 7
/8/9/10 - 17/18/19. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I lost both my arm and leg from an OD., Content: , ups: 616, downs: 0This is a picture of myself. Last may I suffered from a very bad OD and like the post earlier of the dude who slept on his arm, I slept on both my left arm and leg. I died twice due to organ failure, first time I was dead for over an hour, second for 5 mins. I woke up 3 days later without an arm and leg. Was on dialysis for a month due to acute kidney failure and was in the hospital 10 weeks plus 2 weeks in physical therapy. When I first woke up I told my then fiance of 3 years what happened, and she said shes sorry that happened but goodbye because you broke my heart bc you cant stay sober andblocked me on everything, still kinda fucked up from that but fuck it. I'm currently on bupe since then but if you consider bupe clean I've been basically clean since then. I lost everything that day, may 24th I lost all my friends, freedom, invincibility, fiance, a literal arm and leg, and my life, twice.

Edit: I am 22, ODed off what I believe to be some kind of extremely potent long lasting fent analog.

Edit:2 I had cpr done the time when I had no pulse, I was given 19mg narcan and 19mg epinephrine. And someone said in the picture I lost both legs? Lol plz look againSo compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis I’m guessing? 

Glad you made it.Holy shit... Story?Dead for an hour, how the fuck does that work. Thats a scary story man. At least you’re still among the living.take care man.That’s a dark as fuck story. God damn. Insane and very touching to hear. Especially currently being on bupe like myself. I consider bupe a blessing and it’s helped me tremendously and has kept me off dope for 7 months now. I really hope it can work for you as well. Extremely sorry for the pain you’ve been though and hope you can push through these gnarly speed bumpsI wasn't even aware that this was such a common thing... People don't really talk so much about this aspect of the dangers of opioids. In fact I recall fellow junkies being more nervous about folks nodding out on their backs than on their side, because of the whole choking on vomit thing. But I've never actually seen someone vomit while checked out before, but have seen (and been myseld) nodded out in positions that cut off circulation. 

I wonder - is this one of those things where friends need to look out for each other and push nodders onto their backs if they're passed out in awkward positions? Like... what's the safest position to be nodding out in? As I try to imagine it it seems flat on one's back is the only option. Seems like if you try to put somebody in an upright sitting position (against a wall or something), they could easily just fall over onto their arm, or lurch forward and maybe cut off circulation to the legs, or what have you. Maybe flat on the back but with their head propped up on a pillow or something?Sorry that happened to you... at least you still have your right arm and a leg. I wouldnt blame you if your outlook is down now since it happened recently and youre also recently sober, but you can still do great things in life if you will it. I wish you the best.This could not have been easy to share. You are very courageous for that. And thank you on behalf of everyone that you will help with the bravery in sharing this.Thank u for posting this. Im sure u just saved a life or two. Shit in 2019 maybe 30-40. Fuck fent.Are you still using opiates?Wow you must be so STRONG to rebuild from that. You need to start public speaking and get on the circuit.Fuck, OP that's fucking hectic.. Before today I didn't even know this was a thing. I will be so careful from now on when I have the nods. 

I hope you're doing okay.. <3Gotta say from the pic, it looks like you lost TWO legs. I nearly freaked man."So how much does drugs cost these days?" -me

"An arm and a leg" -you


Replace "drugs" with anythingFuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkDead for an hour? HuhMan I dont know what to say man. I feel like things will improve for you. Your post really grounded me this morning. I am in recovery in a woe is me mood. I had lost alot of things. Respect to you.I bet most just assume alligator. Ignint bastardsHey man, you still got your fapping hand. That's what's important, right? 

Keep your chin up- no matter how dark everything seems to be, things get better with timeI think you're an inspiration brother. Thank you for sharing your story. I know what it's like when people turn their backs on you for things that are now completely out of your control. I hope that someday you can achieve sustained happiness.I’ve been given so many extra chances from god. I’ve slept through ODs and got lucky that the shit had short legs that I didn’t suffer any noticeable brain damage. What disturbs me most is that I just found a 6 month old video my webcam recorded during a delirious Benadryl binge, and I had a full on seizure for a couple minutes. I can’t stop thinking about how much worse that could have turned out. The fact that I woke up from it 20 minutes later like nothing happened is pure luck. 

If you want proof, check my recent post on r/DPHYour recovery is amazing, both physically and mentally. Stay strong and clean man.May I cross post thisAwh man that's really rough � I'm sorry to see that. A guy I used to buy from way back when, passed out in the snow in January a few years ago here in canada. He ended up in a wheelchair for almost a year with half of his foot missing.Well may 24th is my birthday so it's bound to suck for everyone.


Sorry broI am so incredibly sorry this happened to you.How are you dead for over an hour?

Edit: I'm not trying to start shit, I have never heard of someone being dead for an hour, then coming back.I only do dope casually every couple months or so but in January I nodded out slept on my arm and couldnt feel it formonths. I didn't know that was as risky as it is. This makes me reconsider fucking around and be more careful if I do.Hope more users see this and seek help for their addictions. Most of my family and friends I grew up with are either dead, in prison, or currently still abusing drugs and their lives are always so full of despair and destruction.  What may start out as a fun thing - getting high and partying with friends leads to the addiction and subsequent destruction of said life. 

Good luck staying sober and hopefully finding a way to enjoy life missing your limbs.[deleted]You're an incredibly strong person, I hope you stay clean and have a good life. There are a lot of shitty people out there, if anyone is abandoning you over this, they're not worth your time.Wish you the best of luck in your recovery. Thank you for sharing your story.I lost 2 of my fingers to frost bite because I was nodding. Passed out with wet gloves on when I was sleeping in my truck one winter. Always thought I had it bad. But damn. Really puts shit in perspective.Fuuuck man I'm so sorry , goddamn you could be dead at least you made itThis is unfortunately not the first time I've seen this . hang in there .Compartment syndrome? Like blood trapped in area for too long? Or something else ...

I’m sorry this happened to you. That’s bad luck. I love your username. It’s clever. Makes me wonder what made you choose it. Other than the obvious meaning in the first word.. I mean. 

I’d ask a million questions bt it looks like this post is super busy with commentsI got Endocarditis from using. Got on Bupe and havent used dope since.I need my friend to see this. He is convinced that if he dies, he dies. And, if he lives, he will live as he always has. I need him to understand how life as he knows it can be altered forever.

Thank you for posting, and I am so sorry that you’ve had to go through thisGod bless you I wish nothing but the best to come your way !I don’t even know what to say this is terrible for someone so young...I almost lost my leg and life due to infect in 2017 I was doing IM fent with the long rigs and had bone deep infection they pulled out 1.5 liter and I needed surgery...I was lucky to make it out and recover. I’m so sorry man. I hope ur family is at least there for u.I'm not trying to be that bitch but one of your other post from a month ago is about buying a shit ton of pills. So how have you been clean for a year?Damn at least you’re alive my dudeI'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/morbidreality] [A lot of the posts over at r\/opiates are worthy of this sub. As a fellow junkie it breaks my heart to see the constant list of deaths\/ODs\/people hurting so bad. Here’s the latest that got me- a 22 yr old guy who’s just had an arm and a leg amputated after passing out in a bad position after an OD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/bekmkr/a_lot_of_the_posts_over_at_ropiates_are_worthy_of/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*How can this happen? Is it lack of oxygen from laying in the same place?I'm so sorry for you. Hope everything will start to get at least a bit better for you after the tragedy.Are you on suboxone or just bupe?You were dead for over an hour? how are you not braindead if your brain didn't have oxygen for an hour?I'm really sorry to hear this. Life will go on and you will be stronger for this.

I do have one question. Did the OD cause any cognitive issues/impairment due to lack of oxygen? If so, can you describe?Sorry you had to go through so much man. And I'm just saying that if you relapsed and are using it's nothing to be ashamed of, recovery is a long process and full of ups and downs. Just gotta take it a day at a time. 

Just wanted to say that since I saw comments about your recent posts about using after you said you were on subs.That's rough as fuck, hope things end up better for you man. Sometimes this life really doesn't feel worth it with all the bullshit, but I always take a look at nature and think I might as well appreciate anything that's here while I am.I can somewhatI can somewhat relate I am 29 been an Intravenous heroin users on and off for 10 years. Last April my leg was getting sore to the point I walked with a limp buy j was so strung out I just kept using and numbing the pain. One day I finally went to the hospital and I had septic arthritis basically an infection had ate away my entire hip joint, I am now waiting for a total hip replacement!...haven't used a needle since November 5th 2018 and down to 25 mgs of methadone. This will be a life long battle and I'm quite lucky the infection didn't spread to my heart or some shit. One day at a time is all I can say!Good luck to you! I hope you stay clean.Thanks for sharing your story man ❤️ I'll be praying for your recovery. I was thinking of trying opiates, I am already familiar with the needle. This makes me reconsider. May God help you and your family ❤️❤️Lmao!! Your leg is the same color as the floor! I was like “seems like he lost both legs. I could be wrong though” �


Anyway hope you feel better.How long do you have to sleep on a limb before it’s too late? Can someone please answer? I actually did this to my leg last night but luckily it was only a few hours. and how high do you have to be to stop your bodies defense from preventing this?If you stopped I respect you. Their is two people I know personally who had a leg removed st the knee and didn’t stop and the other leg was taken too a year or two later.I’m late on commenting but I remember talking to you on the r/drugs discord once. Take it easy man, you’re a good dude who was dealt a bad hand.And I thought MY shit cost an arm and leg...That's the reason why whenever someone goes out around me I straighten them out and use as many pillows as is necessary to keep the neck in a position to keep the airway clear. I always end up babysitting since it seems so many other j's are concerned with getting the hell Away from someone in trouble. I got enough dead friends.....F[removed]Lmfaooooooooo damn that sucksDude, best wishes to you. You still look very well. You might want to try to contact some sort of charity for a bionic/robotic arm or whatever is it called. Despite your loss of an arm and leg I believe you can find a perfect girl with awesome personality and awesome tits and ass. You have another chance. Best wishes to you.In these times everyone needs to volumetrically dose their "heroin" or end up like this

Spread the word, fent can be safely used.

https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosingYou should go to a NA meeting? Get a sponsor Someone with a year or more and working knowledge of the 12 steps. Do a 90 in 90 make a meeting a day and the 90 will take care of its self. Get and use phone numbers, dial them don’t file them! Take it one day at a time, take it easy. I’m a heroin addict with  2 years 1 month 17 days today. I owe my life to the program.Thank you. I’m 22 and seriously considering quitting opiates because of this post.Holy shiiiiiiit!Oh my god I'm so sorry. About 5 years ago I lost my fiancee (pre drugs, not related) and had a hard enough time coping with that. I cant begin to imagine everything you've gone through and lost. HMU if you need someone to talk to anytime.I’m 30 now and I had a similar thing happen when I was 20... I thought I was the only person that something LIKE this happened to. I did a dose made a phone call and woke up in the hospital two days later. I had passed out on my arm for about eight hours and when I woke up it was swollen as fuck and partially paralyzed with intense nerve tingling pain. I was also on dialysis for kidney failure and I had a heart attack and blood clot. They had to check me for compartment syndrome and the method for that is to take a pumpkin carving looking tool and stick it in your arm in different spots to see if there is circulation.. I think. Anyway I lost my home and pretty much my gf and everything that day too. Well, my girl stuck around for a while but the trauma of it all eventually sent her away. I remember I had to think very hard to move my arm. Like my brain would say “move damnit!” And then after a delay my arm would shoot up in the air. It went on like that for days and then after a few weeks I could mostly do stuff but the nerve tingles I have still. Like you could lightly touch my arm with a feather and it would be painful but a lot less than it used to be. I also died and came back during all this, I don’t know how long I was dead for.  I walked away from opiates after this nightmare, for some people it takes AA or NA but for me a horrific OD was enough. I still have mild PTSD from it all and I never talk about it but it haunts me. I am so sorry that you are going through the version of it that you are. I wish you the best and truly hope you can stay away from the opiates and that you find a better girl.Sorry this happened but glad you're alive and have another chance at life. And glad to hear you're using that chance to make things better as well as clean. Being on bupe is totally valid (especially if you suffer any pain from your incident - but even if not..) and while by the definition of some it's not really "clean" its surely recovery and a kickass job at that.Probably a giant overdose of something like Carfentanyl or 3-methfentanyl or along those lines. Both infamously stupidly potent and more/equal euphoria and duration as heroin.

Why didn't narcan help? I assume you got medical help fastYou still have life. Get busy living it and not thinking about what you had! I'm sorry this happened to you but maybe you can use it to help others so it's not in vain .Hey man, for what it’s worth, I lost everything in one moment too. 7 years later I am a completely different person who is capable of loving myself and others and found happiness outside of a chemical

It was the hardest fucking journey ever but worth it in the end. My spinal cord is severed and I’m paralyzed from the waist down. If something drastic hadn’t happened, my life’s trajectory never would’ve changed. I’ve learned it’s all about perspective. 


On a different note, seeing how we are both survivors of things that reaaaaaally should’ve killed us, check out Quantum Immortality, it’s the idea that your consciousness will always perceive itself as surviving if there’s a chance of survival. 

DM if you ever need to chat, my manFucking hell! I've ODed five times and was once dead for most of a night, but that is brutal. I'm thankful everyone I know knows about my use.Sorry you had to go through this. I can't even imagine waking up without two of my limbs. Must have felt like you were dreaming or something.

Just wanted to say that it doesn't matter if other people think you're 'clean' or not. If ita working for you, then that is all that matters. Hope you're able to keep going with it.You "see" anything while dead?You have a career in public speaking.Jesus.  


These posts are making me paranoid I'm gonna fall asleep on my arm or leg. Probably not gonna stop anytime soon, but def gonna take some precautions again.  


2 weeks of physical therapy? I had like 3 months for me and my fucked up leg, god I hated that shit.If there's some light there's light. Stay close to the things in life that brings you joy. Diogenes knows his shitIf it’s any consolation, you still look very nice in my eyes :)

Thank you for making me an 18 y/o, want to never try opiatesHow did you die for an hour and aren’t brain dead? You don’t have to answer obviously. I’m just curiousThe most heartbreaking thing I could imagine. Your strong af dude. UnbelievableHow can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did your heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygen, i'm not being a smart ass i'm just wondering. I'm glad you survived.as someone who suffers from a chronic illness that will always require pain control? and having issues with drugs because of that? bupe is clean. I have been on it for 3 years now as maintenance. It is the only thing I can take that is a partial pain reliever but doesnt cause me to get "high" or loopy of fuck with my head. I still have cravings and I will have to fight those every day for the rest of my life, but because of bupe I can be a functional human being and not feel dirty and gross. 

&#x200B;

So you and I have both been clean! keep it up. My illness has taken alot from me, and I have had alot of surgeries that have changed my body, but on the outside i only have a few scars. If I kept doing what I was doing I would have been wheelchair bound or dead. You may have lost a lot, but you havent lost it all.Where is your right leg?My heart goes out to you. So sorry you’re going through this. I hope you can heal emotionally as well as physically and spiritually, soon.Sorry to hear that man, wow.One week clean. Thank you. I hope you’re getting on well bro.Yes being on bupe is being clean.. don't let anyone tell you differently. Anyone who says you traded one drug for another doesn't know what the fuck they are taking about so just shrug that shit off. Your story is an intense one but my only hope for you would be that you can look into your future and live there rather then in your past, wrapped around this incident. Good luck to you.

Also, maybe change your screen name? Your not a junkie anymore right?Wait why’d they give you epinephrineWhat is OD?Yeah basicallyDude that was my thought as well... what the actual f*ck....What is bupe? I've never heard this beforeSeven months? That’s great. Keep up the good work.This. It's not really something I'd even thought of but it makes sense it would be such an issue. It should definitely be talked about more esp. in harm reduction circles.

To OP : that is just a crazy thing to have happened and awful that you had to go through that :( I'm likely going to keep this in my "look at these when you want to use" folder because just...wow. I'm sorry this happened but glad you posted here about it because.. Yeah I really hadn't thought of that being a possibility. The SO aspect hits close to home too, mine has said she wouldn't stick around if I was in active full blown addiction and I can't blame her.

Tl;Dr you're an amazing person, and I wish the best for you.I'm going to nod out propped up on my bed from now on, limbs will be totally free, and i could vomit if needed.Yea it seems so. He has two recent post about fentanyl and hydromorphone. Op says this happened last may so.........Lol no just one HahaYou could probably mod the other arm too. Mount a  flesh light on the wrist and you have yourself  a  neato cybernetic pocketpussy.That’s really sweet for you to say these things. You have a lot of compassion and so I don’t think you really need serious help.  At all.Wait, what? I take Benadryl every night. Is this a party thing? I’m going to look for your post. I’m glad you’re okay now. Stay safe. 

How can he be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did his heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygenOh this is good to see. Stay safe.No go ahead and PM me lol I had people seeing this that I didnt intend to lolWhat did they pull out 1.5 liters of?Dude never came thru, yeah its fucked up I still crave opiates, and I'm a pos for doing so. Idk man ur not bitchingGood botThey did CPR whole time and  I had PEA, Google itMan man. That was a while ago. And I letgot only talked on that discord once! Add ,me back Somnus#9244Thats actually kinda funny lolYou’re a good person.Seriously?Lol I thought it was funny lol life is too short to laughJust� braI've been doing this for years.. Not sure why you're being downvoted (except maybe the fent comment). I was terrified of an OD when I first started and so I used a sterile vile and filters to create a solution and dosed small (sub 20 units) each time I picked up new shit or shit from someone I didn't know. It's kinda like 'smoke before you poke' but more precise. I'd recommend both this and micron level wheel filters to anyone who IV's especially with them being so damn cheap.How to volumetrically dose H? I'm gonna end up using some soon enough I'd say since we finally have what is apparently good tan H powder.Remember attraction rather than promotion.Please do. It can get very fucking dark quick if you're not careful. Opioids will take your soul from you, if you realize it or not.You can do it homie. When u quit the first 3-5 days are absolute poop. Then you will feel physically 100%, but mentally, your going to be in a really weird, lonely place. Your going to say “im never going to be the same, Ill never feel like i did before opiates”. You'll get urges and your going to feel defeated but dude just keep in there because after 2 weeks, your going to wake up with a cheeck to cheek smile because your going to feel EXACTLY how you did before opiates. Just gotta tale those 2 weeks on the chin then like magic, on day 13 you'll be good. It works like clockwork trust me. Ppl who say your never the same just lie or never truly go clean. Just stay clean for 2 weeks and you'll be good and just remember any urge, any depression, any negativity you will feel is just the residuals of the chemicals in your brain. You can do it man. Don't use subs. Don't taper down. Don't do any of that bs that the pharmaceutical companies tell you. My indian doctor convinced me addiction is 100% mental and once you truly face that fact, there no more “i feel like shit until i take my subs”. Theres no “p.a.w.s”. Its just you feeling sick for a week and a half or 2 weeks, then you completely revert back to normal. DO NOT listen to the people in your rehab or any of that shit because all that does is hypnotize you to where if you even start feeling slight withdrawal, you'll start panicking and making everything 100x worse. Its all just a trap. You can quit soooo easy, dont let them trick you. Its like in vietnam, almost every american GI was addicted to heroin. But they didnt know how heroin addiction works. So when they came home, they just assumed they were sick from the atmosphere change and after a week or so they were fine. But if you sat them down and explained to them they are addicted to heroin, their mind will start filling in the blanks and they would have a much harder time quitting. Trust me, i was 100% convinced that my life was going to consist of being a homeless junkie shooting up on oark benches. But now i have zero urge and i feel better then i did before. And i had a full blown 1.5-2 bun a day habbit.Do it while you can.. I’m 25 and now take 110mgs of methadone every days to get sober.   I go to my clinic every single day.    It’s not something you wantYes, definitely do it! Get help, find a group and a sponsor. Check the links on the side, but there are a ton of resources and advice, there are apps to track sobriety too.Please quitYou lost an arm and a leg to opiates! The pain of withdrawal will fade, but you’re not a starfish man. Quit now while you still have your life.[deleted]I think OP had compartment syndrome.  When circulation is cutoff for hours your muscles begin dying and breaking down in to protein.  These proteins clog the kidneys and shut them down as well.  That's why he needed dialysis.  It's similar to what happens when rattlesnakes bite people.  I had a friend do this number as well, but he wasn't able to turn it into a positive and get his life back on track.Narcan doesn’t work on cardentinal does it? My bf OD’d on it and they were narcaning him and it wasn’t working if I remember correctly...Man I am in recovery and im being pouty this morning. I needed to hear this.Felt like I was halfway between being asleep and awake. Just floating, I knew something bad happened but ar the same time I had no thoughts or sences. It wasn't like I went out then instantly woke up, I was there for some time, idk how to explain it.Not if they keep using.Untill yesterday I didn't know this is even a thing. Holy shit.
Feel terrible for these guys. Your own body weight and that's it.Good. I’m glad that’s your response so we don’t have to read about something like this happening to you, or read your obituary. You have your whole life ahead of you and can accomplish anything you want to.>How can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did your heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygen, i'm not being a smart ass i'm just wondering. I'm glad you survived.

i know, i'm like How can you be dead for an hour?, let alone 5 minutes?, did his heart stop?. 5 minutes is the time it takes for the brain to die due to lack of oxygenThat confused me, too.I was getting CPR entire time at hospital, I had no pulse tho till I came back I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soCPRI'm so happy to hear this. I've struggled and struggled to be clean and still do. I truly hope the best for you.Over-dose. He took too much manAnother person from here lost both his legs from the same thingThere are times that we work on patients (cpr and medicine) for up to an hour and get them back. It’s pretty rare but it does happen.Buprenorphine. Its suboxone if youve ever heard of that. A long lasting partial opioid agonist that people use to get off other opioids. Keeps you from withdrawalYeeshLooking for someone to comment on this. 

Nobody actually cares if you’re sober or not, you’re only lying to yourself.High doses of Benadryl produce the same effect as datura.[deleted]CPRMan I'm on your side your brain can't go without oxygen for as long as this person said.  If you have organ failure from such a large overdose you would most likely die.I didOf pus from the infectionDon't be any harder on yourself dude. I'm here if you need anyone to talk too I'm 23 female never had an o.d. but been through plenty of drug related fucked up shit. Stay strong and keep us updated!I try, I've been doing this long enough that I understand that when someone goes out they're not necessarily dying so it isn't time to run away and worry about if someone's calling the cops or not or some other lame excuse about getting in trouble.  It doesn't take 30 seconds to check a pulse or put a mirror or compact disc to someone's mouth/ nose. More often than not common sense will tell if someone is in trouble or if they just need to recover for a bit. I will admit that nowadays that fent bullshit  got everything fucked up. Cold showers or ice on/in genitals wont work everytime and I've got no access to narcan so I've learned some other tricks. Just trying to take care of my own.I may be a bad person...Seriously what? Op said himself he used since this happened. I hate to sound cruel and im horribly sorry this happened to them, but if thats not the biggest wakeup call to get your shit together ive seen, idk what else would get a person to stop.Cheers, we'll be among the survivors

Why would my fent comment be justified to downvote?You weigh out a large amount with a scale then dissolve in X units of water, then try a bit, if nothing then increase dosage etc.

https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosingYeah it’s happening. I’m pretty much broke despite having a job.[deleted]Hey man how you doing? Just another reminder you changed a lot of people’s lives getting just one person (me) off opiates. Always here to talk. Thanks as always.Do you exercise or anything? I feel like I need a replacement for that dopamine rushExcellent comment, thank you. A lot of people on this sub need to hear this :)I needed to hear this. Thanks goose.I can tell you from experience that tapering off methadone is painless. I know there are many horror stories, mostly from people that rushed it, and it prevents many people from tapering. If you tapered down 2mg a week you'd be off in one year and you would experience no discomfort at all."Just quit" yes because that's how addiction plays out. Your comment is ignorantFuck you man. Thinking about it is the first step. Don’t belittle that, it’s a big fuckin step.You mean carfentanyl? Sure it does, might need more tho. Veterinarians who use it also carry naloxonrI could never imagine what you are going through but I have had some adversity in my life too. Maybe not on your level but I have learned to be greatfull for the things I do have and not angry about the things I don't have.
Holding onto anger is not good, it will only hurt yourself. You can never change the things that have happened to you, you can only change where you are going.
I hope that someday you find the solace that will release you from this pain. Good luck brother.That's crazy.Thank you so much. I have such big dreams and I’m going to accomplish them, I promise youHeart stopped, was getting CPR the entire hour[deleted]CprI don't understand how you got around needing oxygen to your brain as CPR does not provide that but regardless I'm sorry for what happened. I'm glad you are using it as a positive.

On a side note - do you experience any phantom limb issues?Yeah. I’ve been seeing these stories a lot in the last few days. It’s really scary.  I’m clean almost 50 years and when I was using I never heard  of anything like this. I’m wondering if the dope is just so powerful now that this can happen while nodding.  Stay safe.Ooooh ok. What's the difference between that and methadone?My thoughts exactlyWell that’s the crazy thing about this life we choseThere are a few reasons why medical staff would consider prolonging CPR- reason for arrest, age, and CO2 outputProbably got a pulse and lost it multiple timesThey didn't for me for some reason, I asked why they didnt I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soIf you look around this thread he has explained it several times. They were doing CPR on him for that hour and someone in the medical profession said that happens. I know it kind of blew my mind too until I read more.Oh damn, that's a lotUs please, stay safe. I thought Marciano’s was available everywhere. It should be.ProbMaybe maybe not. Comment was a bit in poor taste but mehHe said he slipped up twice since then. Which I mean I get the wakeup call thing but we are drug addicts it's not unreasonable that someone slips up once or twice and hopefully he stooped IV use. It does seem his shit is together he said he's on bupe now. Unless I'm missing somethingNot justified but understandable. Opiates are demonized but fent is treated as the antichrist. That's all I meant. Haven't ever intentionally used fent but I damn sure had it twice unintentionally. Put my dick in the dirt before I could clean up and woke up sober as a judge < 30m laterI'm 22 too, and on the dole indefinitely. It isn't the opiates that kill you in the end, it's the money.Good luck. Just remember that wanting to get clean isn’t enough to overcome this disease. You will likely need intensive therapy and medical support as well as possible 12-step fellowship. Don’t forget that opioid maintenance therapy is safe and effective too. Way too many people have died because they became convinced that being on buprenorphine means not “being clean”. “Being clean” is subjective, what you’re going for is stability across the different areas of your lifeman I wish you the best.  first step has been taken with your willingness to admit this even if just to reddit.

I was a high functioning oxy addict, but like OP said, it got very fucking dark quick and I was relatively careful - never even shot up.

lost all my money, eventually my job, gf went to court mandated rehab, then I went myself.  15 months clean, new job, new city - it can be done.  but man it's not fucking easy, i'm still trying to change my thought process.It's easier if you can maintain the right outlook.  Thats why people say hit the gym and shit, get those free endorphins any way you canFuck it do a lineyou should def exercise and you should def find something to replace the habit. a new hobby, a new sport, a new game, a new class, a new toy, a new goal - something to occupy your mind, especially in those two weeks where you're especially idle. and exercise will physiologically make you and your brain feel better too. forcing yourelf to exercise for 20 min. each day will do wonders.The few years I was clean, excercise helped a lot. I loved that rush.
What I found messed up though was that on subs I didn't get the rush. I just got fat.

So, if you can get it into your life, excercise is awesome for recovery.[deleted][deleted]And it kills the effects? It wasn’t working on my bf but by this time he was unresponsive and spewing pink goo out of his mouth like one of those high school science projects with the volcano.


And I **knew** it was spelt that way! I changed it bc someone else spelt it carfentinal and I got paranoid I was spelling it wrong lolI know you will.Statistically, Doubt itWhere is his right leg?If you're dead for an hour, CPR won't revive you.Yes at first, I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soMainly that suboxone you can be prescribed on a monthly basis and methadone going in daily for which kinda sucks. 

The reason for this is because suboxone is much less abusable I would say. You can abuse it but the high is pretty shity compared to most opiates as it’s only a partial agonist rather than full like most opiates are.Suboxone is an opioid block. It binds to the receptors on the brain, making it difficult to feel the effects of an opiate if taken while suboxone is in the system. I believe methadone is not a blocker but rather more of a craving suppressor . Suboxone supressee cravings we well. Methadone doesn’t block other opiates thoBupe is partial antagonist and methadone is a full antagonistIm not sure exactly all the differences. I do know that suboxone typically comes with naloxone in it, which is a chemical that will kick opioids off their receptors. Im pretty sure its just an anti abuse formula. I dont think methadone has as good analgesic effects either. Both have really long (24-48 hour) half lifes thoughYeah I know but its just really, really young to be going through that.No someone who SAID they were in the medical profession said that happens. it doesn't for a drug to cause him such a massive overdose that his organs failed he would either have died or would not be revivableYeah my butt cheek looks like I got in a savage ass knife fight lmao huge scars from the surgery[removed]Ya think?? Not even I laughed.Just last month he was in here asking how to best use fent saying he was a high tolerance IV user. He said hes slipped up sonce starting bupe. Which for all we know started last week.We are in r/opiates, I always got the impression people here aren't teenage idiots from r/drugs or r/kratom but actually down to earth open minded people like in r/stims

But there's always the exception that proves the rule lol. 

To be fair, an antichrist is just a new version of Christ, like the Mormons who believe Christ is American or something? Like how there are antipopes that people have chosen to see as the word of god rather than the papal pope throughout history.

Brian in Life of Brian is antichrist.

Uhhhh where were we? Oh yeah, fent bad ooga booga ban fent [new super potent opioid class appears]

In Europe fentalogues really isn't much of a problem, they're sold for what they are in nasal sprays usually. Sweden had about 70 deaths from fent in 5 years I think, 250/year or so overall deaths from drugs and we have one of the highest per capita in Europe

Also, >implying sobers are judgeHahaha it is often the opiates dude. The money just makes it super rough on the way down.Yeah the only reason I'm clean rite now (well on subs but I've quit subs before and i can taper relatively easily) is i ran out of cash. I blew through about 5k in saving in a matter of months, all while getting paid an additional 1k every 2 weeks. All that plus my ironclad tolerance made it totally worthless to continue doing dope. Now i’m extremely great full i went broke. It basically saved my life.No it’s the opiatesit can be maintainable. you have to get away from dope though and the needle. that shit will kill you quick. there are more natural options available. i plan on living as long as the rest of my peers, i just plan on doing it a little more pain free than them.>Just remember that wanting to get clean isn’t enough to overcome this disease.

You work for a rehab or something? Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.really? i jumped off at 2mg after several years and didnt have symptoms at all.I wasn't the one that did that what are you talking about? I dont useYes, it kills opioid agonist's effects.

Oh both ways to spell are correct lolYou must be living very low to try and bring others down like that[deleted] I had PEA, Google it, they did CPR the entire time bc of soThank you for answering! You're awesome.Yeah, I’m not familiar with any of this. Not any of these new drugs and pills because I last used H in 1970. This sub blows my mind. And no, I’m not triggered at all. I’m really glad I’m not in this scene any longer but I have great compassion for addicts.You're a dickOh, well I didn't know about any of his prior posts here. I only read this current thread and he portrayed it on here as if he's been on bupe since this happened,  with only one or two slip ups. Shrugs, idkGood luck with that. Everyone thinks they are smarter than the people who ODWishful thinking will be your downfallDealing with the things that cause you to self medicate in the first place is critical. The desire to be clean is important, but if you don't fix the underlying issue's that drive you to use, then maintaining sobriety is hard. Addict's don't have healthy coping skills, and once you stop using, you need to learn them. Drugs for many of us is our coping skill, and obviously, that dosen't work once you want to get clean.Sure, it can be. But for most addicts it’s not. If it was then relapse rates wouldn’t be so high. Of course addiction treatment isn’t one size fits all. Fortunately there are several options. Nonetheless addiction is a chronic disease and not engaging with any sort of treatment will not work for most addicts. Also it is very rare for addicts to not be forced into some sort of treatment at some point in their lives; there are acute and long term effects associated with treatment. There is evidence that suggests treatment has a cumulative effectDo you work for a rehab? Because "wanting to be clean is all you need" is the tripe they peddle with their NA nonsense.You must be ignorant to be offended by statisticsI do. Lol. Look at pic againNo -- the OP said he lost one leg, his left leg.  The guy in the picture appears to be missing both legs.And you didn't initially say this because???No problem! Someone still downvoted for some reason though �‍♂️That reply was incorrect. Naloxone is there for patent purposes and for anti abuse. It’s bioavailability when taken sublingually is vertically non existent. The bupe has a higher binding affinity than other full agonists kicking then off the receptors, not the naloxone which is a common misconception.IndeedIt's true, doesn't need to be fent either. When your tolerance is low from chipping you're at more risk too. I od'd almost fatally from morphine and oxy no fent, and 1mg of clonazepam.it's not about being smarter. i've had this conversation a million times. i'm in my mid 30s, i have a family, i have a job. i know what i'm doing at this point. i don't use street drugs or needles. i'm not looking to get high but for pain relief. there are many many people like me living a normal life on opiates. please don't pretend that anyone who uses an opiate will end up dead, unsuccessful, or in jail. that is one outcome of many.U can bro; pfff u just happen to live in the wrong country ; big pharma pushing em pills to people who doesnt even need it; songs bout it; clothings; its a trend to pop pills and do dope; in here we take it easy ; theres a lot of more ODs from benzos and booze than opiates because if u take some its recreational ure not gonna go and buy more the next day; they sell em perkys without prescription ; but everyone knows that one week and ure hooked; no H were i live ; people smoke opium and weed mixed; only if there is ; same as pills ( hydros, dillys, even fent) but all of us are aware of the degree of addiction; better stick to the sticky ; when americans come they all want those whole perky boxes hydros they even stay to live here for that; but yeah i guess is the place were u grow up and principles u learn in life; ive been dead from a benzos OD but opiates? Pfff who likes WD ; fuck ur veins up? Like damn u dont how the cartel is fuckin up the heroin with fent and as one of my aussie brothers said; they wanna die dude they just dont care; and im not saying it to blame people or make anyone uncomfortable but look around people are hooked ; doctors give em pills like candy; then u end up with the big bad wolf that brown rock u never ever imagine would be inside of you; and damn media goat ; big pharmas; fuckin rap songs ( talking bout perkys like if they were something like weed to fuck with; Actavis like if that shit wouldnt be on ur drink everyday after u try it) i like opiates; a lot but fuck i have a stash and havent touch that shit in weeks or months ; its sad im sorry bout ur story and i hope u realize how worthy ur body is ; it carries ur spirit; when u start to depend on a substance to live ; get mad with everything if you dont have it; or spend thousands realizing ure all alone with that needle; that aint life ; but fuck it ; just a message from someone who yeah i love drugs; i smoke weed; i take micro-dosing of shrooms or lsd ; all for the sake of well being ; gotta be one with urself pf course i smoke opium and weed; but i would smoke it everyday; i would die to go to a pharmacy and buy oxys ; etc; fuck that i wanna be free✌��� start thinking bout yourselves not making em people who dont care shit bout u rich; creating more monsters everyday ;  fuck the FDA the Sacklers ; Purduoom; how much karma they got how many lives they fucked how many futures they ended; and most important how many lives they already took�There are plenty of ways to reduce your OD risk to near zero. Most users aren't willing to do them.

Use test strips, don't mix opioids with other CNS depressants, and *always* do a test shot of 30mg or less. 

If you suspect your dope may have an analog not detected by test strips, you can always make a solution to get rid of hot spots that might exist.


None of these things are hard to do, but most people don't want to spend the money on test strips or wait the extra two minutes before getting the dope in their veins.

I also know many, many users that refuse to do a test shot because they "don't want to waste dope or a high".I'm on /u/mj0r 's side on this, to be honest. If you're cautious and not a daily user you can function just fine with very little trouble. All it takes is common sense and self-control.I'm the person who just got clean one day. For over ten years I was effortlessly clean. I was even occasionally around drugs -- piles of pill bottles at relatives, glassine bags at a friend's house,  finding drugs under my own bed -- and it was like being around broccoli.  I had no interest, no desire to use, nothing. 

What did I do to achieve this? 

Nothing. 

No NA, no MAT, no therapy.  

For years it was a mystery to me until I started learning about phenomenon like aging out and finding out how common it was.

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/

Anyway, it is possible to just get clean and all the people who hysterically told me to go to AA, etc., did nothing to help.  They just annoyed me. 

I am NOT saying it is this simple for everyone.  I AM saying it can be. If other people are helped with therapy,  MAT, whatever,  that's awesome. 

But it's not always necessary and in the case of therapy and rehab, it can be dangerous.  I've posted here before about being in an abusive rehab when I was young. 

There are many different paths to sobriety.  It's frustrating when people insist that any one thing is necessary.fuck coping skills. who needs coping, when you can cop!>Nonetheless addiction is a chronic disease and not engaging with any sort of treatment will not work for most addicts.

Look, NA and rehab have 90% fail rates. And addiction may be neither chronic nor a disease. 

I am very intrigued by the "learning disorder" theory.

https://amp.businessinsider.com/maia-szalavitz-unbroken-brain-treating-addiction-as-a-learning-disorder-2016-4

God knows we need new theories since the options we have now have such huge, unacceptable fail rates.

MAT is your best bet when it comes to mortality rates -- it reduces mortality rates in recovering addicts by 50% or more. 

>there are acute and long term effects associated with treatment. 

Yeah, I know.  PTSD. Found out the hard way., unfortunately.I never said wanting to be clean is all you need.

You shouldn't lie about what I said. 

As for NA, I am no fan of it or of rehabs or their 90% fail rates.I don’t work for a rehab and not all mental health clinicians advocate 12-step attendance. It doesn’t work for some people. Fortunately there are other options out there. Doing nothing is likely not an option for most people. When people prescribe things on a societal level they are looking for processes that are replicableLol I get it but you’re just being a fuckhead for the sake of itPlz look again lol I have my right arm and legBc? Idk man I just wrote from the heart not really getting into details like thatWell, so upvoted you to counter the downvote. Who would do that? I mean, what’s their rationale?Idk why people cant just chuckle and move on. I make the same shitty jokes. I woke up paralyzed once and people were mad at me for making jokes.. ABOUT MY OWN FUCKING PARALYSIS! Geez.>  I od'd almost fatally from morphine and oxy 

How much, if you don't mind my asking?> i don't use street drugs 

There's the difference. You know you're not getting fent, or worse yet, carfentanil.I wholeheartedly agree with you! Never cared for the "HIGH", just the pain relief. I'm disabled, and have lost quite a bit over the past few years since I haven't been able to work. Now I just pray my soon to be pain doc won't be scared to prescribe me the amount I need to function. Opiates are not problem, it's what you want from them that gets dangerous.Anyone using opiates to get high is at great risk of addiction and subsequently overdoses. If you’re using them as prescribed you’re pretty much going to be alright as long as the doctor tapers you off them if you ever decide to get off painkillers. If taken as prescribed opiates are a gift from the universe that has revolutionized medicine since their discovery.I'm a toss my story in.
My od was after using for many years, but after a long break. It was tiny, I mean tiny. Less than a third of a point, and I woke up on the floor surrounded by medics.
4 days in coma after that. Aspirated something into my lungs, was coughing up blood and drowning as I got to the hospital.

We all think we're smart. It has nothing to do with that.It's about being consistent. Everyone can be smart. I use heroin and a needle, been doing it daily for 12 years. Past 3 I've only done it weekly. Life is fine. Going on vacation in 2 weeks to the Caribbean where I won't have anything. I'm looking to get high. But also looking for pain relief, ain't gonna lie. Main reason I don't use H every day is because I don't want to scar my arms (anymore worse), and money. If I had the money like I did before, I'd use, no problem.

&#x200B;

But it's about being consistant in doing the things that prevent OD. For example, testing my dope everytime, always assuming I have a low tolerance, I never assume anything about the dope. Never mixing drugs (I still do sometimes, but very rarely and carefully). I use alone, and that soudns stupid, but after I use, I always go outside to the dog park, in the event I do OD, it's in public and someone (which nearly everyone who lives near me knows) can do something. It's not about being aware, it's about making it a habit.  


In short, respect the drug. I always treated injecting heroin like a medical procedure. I tell alot of people who ask me if I can get them some to try, etc. That this is no fuckin joke. This isn't 2005 where any joe blow can go buy a cap of H, and slam it and be fine. There's fent in them pills! There's NO room for error. None. It's like skydiving.Careful...it's like an avalanche..all beautiful and serene...til it breaks loose and destroys everything..You sound exactly like every addict I've ever known.U are right, i am one but for the sake of harm reduction ehhhh...exactly thisAh yes, common sense and self-control. Along with "willpower" and "wanting to get clean and live a normal life," the easiest cures we have for the opioid epidemic. I'm not sure why anyone didn't think of this before you did. You'd think all the mental health and medical professionals busting their asses on this problem every single day would have figured that out by now.


*tongue in cheek, because this is far and away the most ignorant and most dangerous view anyone can have regarding this problem.Don’t you think that everyone said this at one point?Dude, for almost 10 years I danced on that thin line. Unfortunately, at some point I fell off it and now I'm shooting 1 g a day. Its just like death and taxes, if you gamble with it....eventually EVERYONE will fall to it if you play long enough! It may take 1 person only a month to fall, but the next person is like me and it took nearly 10 years.....but everyone eventually falls. Unless they quit before that happens, its going to happen!Thank God this wasn't me, I love broccoli!I'm sober as well, after using drugs for 25+ years. Everyone's path in life and sobriety is different. That's great that it worked for you like that. But generally, it's not like that for other people, mainly the people who are self medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma. Those things don't go away on their own, they need to be managed and addressed. The person suggesting OP seek out support or therapy to help them deal with the things going on in their life was hardly out of line. Sobriety for most people takes work, it isn't "effortless". There are ups and downs, at times you struggle, at times you feel great, but for the majority it isn't something that just happens and your just "healed".Thanks for posting this. I thought I was pretty well versed in my understanding of the different theories about addiction and I have never heard of this phenomenon before.Thanks for posting this. I'm getting to this point. Older now, I use less and less every year. It's almost gradual how my recovery is coming aboutGood for you—sincerely glad this happened to you. I’ve seen it happen very rarely. Sadly though from my experience living among/working with addicts and all the literature (legit medical research) you are definitely in a very small minority. 
Very cool thoFor some it works to white knuckle it out but for others especially if their environment encourages them and there is no support mechanism or coping skills, will revert back to using. 

It is easier doing it with a group of people. Even here online there is support.Listen man I hear you. I was transported as an adolescent to wilderness therapy, therapeutic boarding school, etc. Still, the biggest problem with advocating “doing nothing” is that it’s not a replicable process. We have no idea why you were able to spontaneously recover. And since we have no idea it’s not smart to recommend it to people. Additionally evidence suggests that treatment may have a cumulative effectYou weren't a real addictI also think NA doesn’t work for some people, so I’m not sure why you think that’s what I’m suggesting for everyone. It does work for some people though so it’s at least worth checking out. If anything I’m upset that AA/NA have a cultural monopoly on the “addiction as a disease” model. Addiction can be a disease and there can exist plenty of other treatments, like as you suggested, methadone, to treat it. Are you still clean? That’s a genuine question. I understand that even if you’re not clean that that doesn’t invalidate the ten years you wereI tried NA when I was younger, and everytime it caused me to go out and use. I couldnt sit there and talk to strangers about drugs without it penetrating my brain and causing a definite relapse. There must be others like me.oh maybe i misread.> Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.

You did though. Are you going to really emphasize the “can” in that sentence?Doing nothing was the best option for me, eventually my use slowed down. :/Seems like you are too with your unnecessary aggressionBro, this guy is the lowest of lows, look at his comment historyYou wrote something that sounds impossible and clearly raised a lot of doubt among people.No idea. Someone probably didn't like something i said and went through my account randomly downvoting my comments. Or maybe its someone coming onto the opiates sub to downvote "junkies" 

People are weird �‍♂️Because being the one to throw punches at your own self is something entirely different from throwing punches at somebody else , a stranger at that, about a sensitive topic.Would like to know the answer, feel like I ODed on xr morphine and that’s why I want to kinda quit.210mg or so of morphine and 40-60 of oxy.My boyfriend ODd and almost died from carfentanil but ended up okay.

Then I saw that horrible movie Jurassic World 2 and the fucking **dinosaur** had to be put down by that shit. Now my bf thinks he’s bad ass cause he survived dino sedatives �ironic that you quitting was what caused you to overdose.If you OD your not going to make it outside to the park. It's usually pretty instant when IVingfor sure. you're just playing a bit more of a dangerous game but it's the same game. our lifestyles are probably quite similar, you just take more risk. the stuff i use is technically legal until you make it so i don't have to worry about the police. i don't have to worry about infections from needles. overdosing is nearly impossible. no obvious signs of use on the outside. so i have a little more room for error than you do but like you said as long as you are vigilant you should be good.my avalanche already crumbled years ago. i've been at this for 15 years. i had a lot of the same issues that people on here post about. i've learned and adapted. i'm not saying there is no chance of something bad happening but i take a bigger risk every time i drive my car. i know it's not the norm and most people will assume it'll catch up with me eventually, and maybe it will, but my life is stable and consistent. with the stuff i take i would have to try really really hard to overdose, i have narcan, i don't spend more than i make, my life doesn't revolve around the substance. as far as i can see, i think i'll be alright for the foreseeable future.okay, are they all in their mid 30s with a happy wife and kid? are they house hunting? do they and their wife both drive cars less than 5 years old? are they comfortable financially? if so, good for them!I can bs on that. All the will power and "wanting to get clean" and live a normal life doesn't mean dick to me when maintenance with kratom seems like an easier route to accomplish "living a normal life"   


Only thing my will power gave me, is the willpower to continue using heroin and not destroy my life. I guess to do heroin smarter.I don't really think that's true. Maybe MOST will fail at some point, but there are plenty of examples of people who consistently practice harm reduction and can maintain a decent lifestyle.LOL!! I needed that! ������

And so it IS true.  People who like broccoli actually exist! Who knew?!

Update: Who would downvote this? Smh.>I'm sober as well, after using drugs for 25+ years.

That's wonderful! �

>But generally, it's not like that for other people, mainly the people who are self medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma.

Oh, I've had trauma. One of the worst was a rehab I was stuck in when I was young.  I have PTSD from that.

I know what happened when I got clean doesn't happen that way for a lot of people. 

I just want people to know it can happen.  And that it does happen.  

>medicating mental illness or suffered severe trauma. Those things don't go away on their own, they need to managed and addressed.

I agree. 100%

>The person suggesting OP seek out support or therapy to help them deal with the things going on in their life was hardly out of line.

I didn't think they were.  I am just very cautious when it comes to therapy because of the abuse I suffered. 

>Sobriety for most people takes work, it isn't "effortless". 

Again, I know this. Trust me, I was as absolutely stunned as anyone else. That's why I want people to know it can happen.  Doesn't mean it will. But it might.

I think in my case, it was a combination of aging out and my life falling into order. For once, there was a perfect storm that was good.

>Sadly though from my experience living among/working with addicts and all the literature (legit medical research) you are definitely in a very small minority.

I am also talking about legit medical research and have provided links to both the research and articles about the research. 

The research indicates I am really not in a minority. 

Read this article:

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/>For some it works to white knuckle it out

Omg. I've heard this before.  I didn't appreciate it then and I don't know. 

It's like you don't know what the word "effortless" means.

There was no white-knuckling at all.

NO WHITE-KNUCKLING. 

It was EASY. Effortless. Like someone flipped off a switch.

>It is easier doing it with a group of people. 

For some.  Remember when I said there is no one right way? It's not always easier with a group.  It sure wasn't for me. I didn't appreciate people assuming I was white-knuckling it when I wasn't. 

I didn't like having my truth utterly dismissed because it didn't fit some people's paradigm.>Listen man I hear you. I was transported as an adolescent to wilderness therapy, therapeutic boarding school, etc. 

I am SO SORRY that happened to you. 

Have you read Help At Any Cost? It really helped me understand what happened to me. Here's a link:

http://helpatanycost.com/


>Still, the biggest problem with advocating “doing nothing” 

I am not advocating that. 

>We have no idea why you were able to spontaneously recover.

Actually, we do. Check this out:

https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2014/ageing-out-of-addiction/

>And since we have no idea it’s not smart to recommend it to people. 

I didn't. 

>Additionally evidence suggests that treatment may have a cumulative effect

Link, please.Oh, really? Please share your definition of what a real addict is -- and explain how you know I don't fit that definition. 

I'll wait.

The truth is -- my experience with addiction is pretty darn typical.  Here are some more links.


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/can-you-get-over-an-addiction.html


https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/opinion/addiction-recovery-survivors.html>I also think NA doesn’t work for some people, so I’m not sure why you think that’s what I’m suggesting for everyone. 

I never said that.  I don't think that. 

>It does work for some people though so it’s at least worth checking out.

10%. Yes, it's worth checking out.  But if it's not for you, andbodds are it won't be,  well, then, it's worth checking out. 

>If anything I’m upset that AA/NA have a cultural monopoly on the “addiction as a disease” model

I agree 100%!

>Addiction can be a disease and there can exist plenty of other treatments, like as you suggested, methadone, to treat it. 

Mmmm, the disease model has some things to recommend it, definitely, but the learning disorder theory makes SO MUCH SENSE to me. Did you read the link? Here it is again, just in case you didn't.

>Are you still clean? That’s a genuine question.

That's a tough question. The answer is.....I don't know.  I unfortunately developed an autoimmune condition that can be extremely painful.  I don't use any illegal drugs and have no interest in using illegal drugs.

But I do have my prescriptions.

Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences.  I don't think I fit that.

I definitely use my medication to feel better -- but Jesus! I feel terrible, so what am I supposed to do?

>I understand that even if you’re not clean that that doesn’t invalidate the ten years you were

You are awesome..I like you, man! �Oh, man. There are so many others like you!
>Because wanting to be clean can be all you need.


>You did though.

No. I didn't. 


> Are you going to really emphasize the “can” in that sentence?

Yes. I am. That's why I said "can be" instead of  "is."I did haha, it made me feel much better :)Too much time on their hands and a small mind.Its not a punch tho, it's a joke. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Heroin to get me through it, Content: , ups: 614, downs: 0Oops... it took wayyyy too long to get this. For me the weird part about being clean more often then not is taking a shit everyday like a normal human being. Not used to that at all[deleted]This took me way, WAY too long to get. I'm embarrassed for myself.:)I usually hate memes and think they have no place here, but I have to admit that this one made me chuckle out loud. Good one. AhahahahahahahaBeautiful.LolA meme is only funny when the picture actually has something to do with the textI dont get itLiterally when I was in impatient rehab I would shit everyday and think. My god this is weird, going everyday and there's no intense fear to use the bathroom and no pain when I do. This seems wrong.lmao same. Late here but getting used to eating every day/more than a couple times a week was hell when I cut off mandy. Have some 'friends' who felt the same cutting out tina. Goddamn marroon.Keep it up man!No matter what you think of yourself, you can get through it.  Do it for your daughter, please.

PleaseReread the meme. Hes clean because he showers, not clean from dope.

But good on you man, keep it up.A very top notch shitpost lol[deleted]The picture is relevant, the lil homie hates to shower and he's sad about it. At least he's got dope though.Nah, that shit is funny. And true. The shower is what keeps him cleanI just feel so dirty after doing the deed. I'm not used to that much poop all the damn time lol. Right? dude comments right away to make sure we don't laugh at an incorrect meme lmao sweet life!Not sure opiates is the best place to be making fun of people for being a failureNot really, just thought this particular 'meme', an animal making a sad face.. was a shit one.[deleted]because he showers, he doesn't do heroin. I logged on to reddit, clicked this sub - saw this so I clicked it. It's not like I sat there clicking refresh waiting for it... and while your making incorrect assumptions - my life is pretty sweet, thanks �[deleted]Opinions are okay.  Nothing wrong with having opinions.  But when you tell everyone else what's funny (or not funny,) you open yourself up to being called out as the asshole you're actively being.  Work on thickening up that skin a bit and laugh or not laugh at your convenience.  Hell, nothing wrong with even saying you didn't like it.  Just don't tell everyone else not to and you won't be ridiculed.  Easy peasy.  This concludes today's lesson of Not Being an Asshole.  It's a cute baby bear I mean what else would be more appropriate? I think it works better than a pic of a fucking actual heroin addict shooting up everyday and showering. Hmmm jus saying it's not that big a deal either way. yeah man, i think would've been mad funnier with a photo of a junkie in the shower shooting up.

or at least they could have put the bear in the shower. or made the bear a junkie. or something.I like dogs. Do you like dogs?10/10 prefer showers to methadone'My life is pretty sweet...' except for when someone posts a goddamn incorrect meme!I don't know shit about you or your life I was just calling it how I saw it in front or me. I think I accurately did just that, minus the misunderstanding about the excellence you piss daily, my bad!Ahhahahahahahahaaaaa, ohhhhmg, gimme a sec.....*i gulp down some water + hack*........*flopping heavily down in my chair, a mirthful smile upon my face, i grab my blade and lift it to the top of my smartphone*.......*with a shake of the head, i drag it through the pile of powder and scoop some into the metal cap i'm holding by the edge of the phone*.... laughing is a blessing especially for those who's dopamine and serotonin levels are inherently low - and seemingly require, whether as a byproduct of or the reason for no one knows, the use of artificial means to prop up the levels high enough to make it so that suicide becomes 'not an option' instead of 'well, that sounds like a fucking good idea'. so thanks for the laugh @completelyshitfaced!

1. memes are funny often enough when the text and photo don't match
2. sometimes that's the content of the joke - that they don't match
3. who the fuck cares??
4. fuck you, asshole![deleted]Yep, 2016. Where I know the difference, I'm just typing on my mobile and aren't all that concerned about the occasional grammatical error.Go home, you're shitfaced. But super concerned about a meme error.

Also, "aren't" is not what you want to use in that sentence. Ewwww alchohol, sorry we don't associate with addicts in this sub :PAwesome name. I think he meant to say "I'm not," but idk he's being all nazi over here.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Saw Fetty Wap on my way back from copping, Content: , ups: 614, downs: 0Did you say hey what's up hello?yo dont lie, hes your dboy. #fettycoppeddamn dats really dat nigga fetty waphe winked at you bruhfenty wapThey let niggas with only one eye drive?

Niggas got the Christmas i8 that's crazy lol1738i didnt think you could drive with one eye (legally i mean)cuz of bad depth perceptionI actually really want to hear his new song with tekashi69 Best pic ever posted on this sub Reddit.

DaaaamnFucking awesome NICEOh Its Lit fam[removed][removed]He kinda deserved to fall off the way he did. He isn’t very good and was a terrible performer.

Edit: yah I’m a Fetty hater. Anybody who has ever seen him perform knows he easily one of the worst performers. Shows up 30 minutes late to every concert and leaves early in 75% of them. It’s not a one off thing.[removed]Upvote this if this is dank. I am a bot and this was automatically submitted. Please rate.Literally who? Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door!Hahah classic! I bet he gets that all the time...good to see the man still rolling thru his old blocks, Fetty seems like a pretty straight up nigga, he just needs another hit to get back poppinYo for real tho imagine the shit he gets.. hahaWetty fap*You'd think it was from some "cool" hood rat story, deal gone bad or something... in an interview he said it was from conjunctivitis as a kid. :(He’s got like 6 kids from 5 women to pay child support for. Randomly took a picture lmfao Hahaha yeah I feed the homeless sometimes It's actually a ninja-turtle theme i8 but still dope i'm like baby girl hello?!My dad drove all the time. (Lost eye in childhood hunting accident) He could see deer way before the rest of us could. (We grew up in a rural area)  He also had a plane that he flew very illegally. I flew with him quite a few times. He was damn good pilot.Fetty's new shit is pretty fire and I'm a white dude from Oklahoma.Nah he was moving bulk my nigggguhYep. That’s him[removed][removed]Still so fucking rich that he doesn’t care what we think tho Fell off???  I guess you live under a rock this nigga is all over the radio.> Shows up 30 minutes late to every concert 

You've never been to another concert with any person/group that "made it", have you? 30 minutes late is actually early.Fuckin haterNjBad botSexybotIt was in that moment that Jessica realized she was not in fact, a "trap queen," and probably shouldn't have let her D-Boy nut in her.Fetty most likely doesn’t do H idiotI think letting your kids conjunctivitis get so bad they lose an eye is pretty hood.I give him props for not making up a ghetto story.poor guyUsername checks out! I can see it in my head as we speak. You copp, you're excited, about to get high, Oh look! Fetty Wapp! ::casually snaps picture while cheesing and keeps it moving:: LMAOOO LOL, that would explain his facial expressionAka myself

Ephasis on SOMETIMES. Because I need dope ALL the time. Feeding myself isn't always in the cardsOne of my flight instructors was blind in one eye and they let her get a license. In fact she flies for American these daysHahahah this whole time i thought one eye willie was from newark hahahah..my bad bruhhHahahah well im retarded i always thought he was from newark..im from jersey too[removed][removed]Contrary to popular belief, most artists are very prompt with their performances, and venues have time constraints they have to stick to as well.

Source:  worked & played at a bunch of different music venues my entire adult life.I went to a Guns n Roses concert in Philly 1991...they were notorious for going on late... plus, it was a crapshoot whether it was a good night or bad in terms of show quality, performance, and length. 

Anyway, show was supposed to start at 7:30ish. Soundgarden was the opener and they were AWFUL that night. They were off the stage by 8pm.....G n R didn't come on until 11:30...but damn, it was worth it.  To this day, it remains one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  Short of like Kanye arena tour that starts right on time, this is basically universal>D-don't criticize stuff I like

Why is everyone on the internet so thin-skinned?Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that DawgfoodMN is not a bot.

Not shitting on his parents, I’m sure they’re nice, but no kid from the suburbs loses his eye over damn pinkeye. Most of the time he doesn't talk about it, he just kind of wants you to assume it was some hood shit. Think he just slipped up one time during an interview. Probably too much *lean* and he let down the facade. Does shooting a twenty to some street kid to get u sum fire, count as feeding the homeless?Wow. Thought it was very illegal. [deleted][removed]Lol I'm such a noob I've been to hundreds of concerts and only the small-time acts have been anywhere near on time for the start-time written on the ticket. It's expected to be an hour or an hour and a half laterUnless Pearl Jam is playing. I think that's one of the funniest stories. He's bitching at promoters to have them get off the stage cause they drew most of the crowd. The promoters basically told him, "dude, that's Pearl Jam, you don't just ask them to quit playing."If it's a festival kind of thing, sure, timing becomes more important. I was referring to concerts where there's like one front band and then the main act and then you go home.Bad botLol the fucking bot of canned meat. Anti spam (canned meat) bitch I am 100% sure that perrycohen is an absolute cuck and hive a minded bot. Bad spam detector. You are spamGorgeous George got rekt.I like the user nameWhy downvotes? Do y’all think he does? �Wasn't pink eye.  He was born with glaucoma in both eyes or something. De wasn't pink eye.This would definitely be the smarter approach Hm.  You're probably right.It's illegal if he doesn't have his pilot's license [Yes.](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/et/31-34/mv/)Hahah really is pretty much the sameIf you're referring to the difference between a door time and a show time, okay.  Or the fact that the start time means that's when the opening/support act goes on (not the headliner), then okay.  But there are strict set times for ALL acts at all reputable music venues, from clubs up to arenas.  Always.  If an artist goes on late, it's them exhibiting diva-like (aka shitty) behavior...it costs promoters a shit ton of money when artists don't stick to advanced and agreed-upon set times...especially when the local crew is unionized (overtime/time and a half is EXPENSIVE) or noise ordinances are involved.

thanks bro. He don’t they’re trippingNah his parents got him some type of surgery or some shit and the doctors fucked it up .[deleted]
i'm talking about the time it says on the ticket.

Like " BLAH - 9:00" means they will start playing by 10, at the earliest.

Against, festival and multiple-act situations are different.[This Comment Is Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food))Spam is bae Of course you do ODB. God bless> I love spam

I love spamYou can obtain a medical with monocular vision is what my link states, how's it not possible?Usually the time printed on tickets (unless otherwise noted) is the time that the venue begins letting people in, AKA door time.  And in that case, you are spot-on, because doors are usually one hour prior to showtime.  More in-depth tix might state "doors at 7, show at 8" but not always.Spam> I love spam

I love spam

I love spamPerhaps it's different in the shows you're attending, but for the exception of some bar-level venues, the ticket will sometimes list an additional time for door, like "Doors at 8, show starts at 9" or they simply say "Show at 9" and the doors are open prior for people to arrive and take their seats, etc.

Here's an example ticket I found on the internet:

https://images.iacpublishinglabs.com/reference-production-images/question/29897795207a83ff9fc761f3642040e6/aq/700px-394px/purchase-concert-tickets-ticketmaster_30bfba1154701bea.jpgticketmaster_30bfba1154701bea.jpg

You can see it says doors at 7, then lists "8:00" elsewhere on the ticket, but if I were going to this show I would not expect the show to begin until 9.What is spam?

No fucking doubtI've often fantasized about being rich in the old west, just living the life in the opium den or at the saloon with all the doves passing around syphilis. And there was cough syrup containing alcohol, morphine and cannabis... �Now it’s ketamine induction. Apparently it’s curing suicide cases quite effectively Thats the worst part?Probably morphine since heroin wasn't invented till 1874.Interesting. Heroin didn't exist 150 years ago...  Not sure vibrators did either...  But i get her point lmao.My treatment is *still* vibrators and heroin.Did you just have a stroke?That sounds pretty fuckin good. How is it different now?I'd prefer some opium or morphine, but either way it sounds better than shitty SSRI'sYAY FOR HEROIN!!!Reeee PoooostStill funny. Got my upvote.I can

A priest and a rabbi walk into an abortion clinic when one of them stops and say "does this taste funny to you?"No way, really?"Give little Agnes 2 heroins and she'll be fine."friend gets it intravenously. she says its working wonders. gets it like twice every week! 
i wish my doctor would try it :/ I had ketamine infusions and it totally cured my suicidal ideation. It’s a total game changer. Didn’t hole, but got the nice drunk feeling while listening to music for an hour. The downside is insurance won’t cover it (off-label use) and it is priiiiiceyYa... If so, Im not really sure that she is depressed at all. Lol for real.  How about the worst part about depression is having fucking depression.  It sounds like she's essentially saying, depression would totally be worth it if i could get an RX for heroin.  Fuck that, i'd give almost anything not to have depression at all.  That's close enough to 150 years for meHeroin definitely existed While writing the title yeah, unfortunately.  Currently in hospital, wish me the best.Yes my title was actually meant to say "found this in r/funny". But I had a stroke while typing it and barely manages to hit post.   

Currently typing this with my tounge from a hospital bed.  Wish me luck l.You can what?Cannabis indica and laudanum was available in an ethyl alcohol solution as a cough remedy, it wasn't that high of a dose though.[Yeah, I went to the top posts in the Baltimore subreddit for this pic but it makes the rounds on a lot of subs](https://i.redd.it/zhwkh6fqthp11.jpg)I’ve heard great things. I thought I had severe depression and ocd. Turns out I was just a meth Xanax and heroin addict and once I got clean it all went away. I guess being addicted to IV heroin depresses you. 25 months clean now and haven’t had a bad day since like 3 months clean. That ketamine treatment though is fascinating to me. Used to just put me in a k hole. Yeah, Right?�Word up man, fuck this disease in its entirety..I reckon the worst part not being able to physically point to anything, not a splintered bone sticking out of my thigh, not a much higher than appropriate number of white blood cells in ink on paper.

Your children are fine, and they're happy. They're doing really well in school. They have an almost free ride to St Paul's Lutheran. And what the church doesn't pay for, I can pay for it. It's okay. I don't know how to reach you, your number is disconnected. If you see this, I hope that you know that everything with your kids is okay.

I love you. , ups: 591, downs: 0Ugh, this is heartbreaking.  

I hope that your sister is ok and she can find peace with herself.Damn this makes me feel like shit for all the times I've just shut off my phone and gone dark on my family for weeks at a time. Think I'll give my mom a call tomorrowThat's heart wrenching! I hope your sis finds her way back to you guys. 


And Emily, if you're reading this, you don't need to be clean to have a connection to your loved ones. I don't know anything about your situation and this might be off, but it's never too late to turn around and reach out. 




All this pressure that's been put on addicts and the stigma are really counter productive. In fact, if people love you (and it looks like they do) they will be ready to start a clean slate. You don't have to go this path alone. Mostly, people assume they need to be ready to get clean to rebuild connections, but having a social net and a life worth fighting for is a great motivator. Not that I managed to get clean, but I managed a lot of other things! Like getting a degree, working on my relationships with my friends, my mom and siblings - and even tho I'm far from clean (maintenance & using on top), I've managed to make progress in many other areas of life. That next step will be taken eventually. Or not. Who knows. But there's no need to put everything else on hold to prioritize the nigh impossible step to sustained sobriety. 


Wishing you and your family the best of luck! <3 



I hope your sister Emmy is okay. Sending your family positive vibes. You're a cool sibling. I hope you can reconnect with Emmy soon.I obviously don't know you or Emily, just wanted to say thank you for trying to get in touch or at least leave a message about her kids for her. It means a lot to see someone not only perform the act of trying to communicate, but also to have the content of the communication not be something that would fulfill expectations by being accusatory and degrading. 
  You mention in a comment that the last contact you had was the day after you took responsibility for her children when a judge removed them from her care. It feels, just based on that, that you have stepped up to make a horrible situation a little less tragic. Not having had contact with her since the day after that happened makes me think that she probably took the judge's decision really hard. It probably crushed her, I know it would have that effect on me if I had kids and had to go through forced separation from them. Thank you for demonstrating that you don't have to assume that people with drug problems are sub-human and uncaring. I hope that she feels worthy of your care, and not totally degraded by being told (whether rightly or not) that she is not capable of being a mother to the children that she gave life to. What a sad situation.Sitting here while my son naps on me, and this definitely made be start crying. I hope everything works out for you. She is lucky to have you.Love and support To be frank, I fucking hate people like your sister.

Thank God you stepped up for those kids, many children of deadbeat parents like your sister aren't so lucky. Love you tooBro this fucking hurt to read. Youre a saint for helping your nieces and or nephews man. If I saw my sister try and reach out to me I'd bawl my eyes out. Emmy I hope you see this babe. Just know your family cares enough to reach out to you. Because not everyone's family would do that. As someone who is currently ghosting on family and my dogbabies, I want to say she may just be working on herself to prepare herself to face how things turned out. Hoping that she is doing OK, and that she’s trying her best to get where she needs to be. Also, you deserve infinite appreciation for what you are doing for her and her children. I can assure you that they will all remember your altruism.  OP, you are an awesome person. I can feel the amount of love you have for your sister thru your words in this post. I have negative feelings towards parents who abandon their children but I'm so grateful that your sisters kids had someone like you to step up and give the kids the kind of love and support they deserve and need. It's even worse imo of your sister because I figure you would allow her to be in their lives in the right circumstances yet she doesn't even try. But as you said, that's most likely the best for them and they are the ones who truly matter in all of this. Keep being an amazing person and with someone like you being there for those kids, I have a feeling they're going to be just fine.This breaks my fucking heart. There is no love like the love of family. Sigh. I hope it works out. OP You're a wonderful person for taking care of her kids. I hope your sis finds this post and you guys get back in touch. Much love <3UghOP your an amazing person , I just want to say thankyou for everything you have done for those kids . I don’t know you but I do know you have a huge heart and deserves happiness I wish you the best of luck with everything , seriously your a great person keep it up ��. If you can pls keep us posted if you happen to find her..I wish to hear her story . & I’d really wish to hear a redemption story I know it’s a long shot but you never know what somebody might do . Have a good night..
                                                                  - MikeI'm glad those children have you in their lives. I hope your sister is safe and finds her way back into your life.My heart goes out to you and your family. 
I hope you both find a way back to each other on better terms � bless you for taking caring of your family too. this is beautiful.Crazy fuckin life story dude, AaaakwarrdEmily if you see this there’s still time to clean up your act. Sending love to everyone. Win the war,  not just the battle.  Call your mom. Please do it and not just say you're going too.

As a mom, nothing and I mean nothing is better than hearing your child's voice.  Trust me on this one.Lost my younger (19) brother back in 2010. Would give anything to still be able to make that call again. Don’t let petty stuff come between you and family. Be the better person and let them know you love them every day. Good luckYes!  I put my entire life on hold for years because I believed I had to be 100% clean to have any worthwhile relationships. It's not true. 

There are varying degrees to using. Reach out, Emmy. You may not be able to have the relationships you want right off the bat, but letting family know you are ok really helps them. 

Sorry kinda rambling. I hope you're ok out there.  I guess I understand her situation. I'm a recovering alcoholic. But I've been clean For five or six years now. trust me, I don't pretend to believe that alcoholism is anywhere near as terrible as heroin. But I've been there.

 Don't get me wrong. If she shows up at my house, I will call the police. (There's a protective order). I do want a phone call.Junkies abandoning their kids gives the kids about a 75% chance of becoming a junkie themselves. Speaking of, where is exactly IS my Dad anyways? That was a long trip to go get cigs.

Ah, abandonment issues...
People are assholes for downvoting this. I don't give a shit how much you like drugs. You can't figure out how to use drugs responsibly and take care of your kid? Then quit doing fucking drugs and take care of your kid because they are more important than you are. Drug addiction is a mental health issue.

Do you look at schizophrenics and think, *"Fucking deadbeat parent. What an asshole."*

No one wants to abandon their kids.

No one wants to pick dope over their family.

No one wants this kind of pain and suffering.

Come on man - I mean, really?Piss off.This is late, I know, but just send them a text.  They're terrified.  Just text them to let them know you're alive.  

I love you and I support you.How so?It's not even about cleaning up her act at this point, is what I'm gathering from his post.

It sounds as if her family just wants to know she's ok.[deleted]People down-vote because this sub is full of addicts who don't take responsibility for their own behavior and think using drugs is an excuse to be a deadbeat parent.

If you want to do drugs, that's cool.  I know I personally wasted 10 years of *my own* life being addicted to opiates.  But when you involve children, you're just a low life piece of shit if you choose your fix over the welfare of your own child.I respect your opinion but I don't think opiate addiction and schizophrenia is a fair comparison at all.  Addicts can control the worst symptoms of addiction with free will, I don't believe that's the case for a schizophrenic.

I don't deny addiction exists; I know it does because it took 10 years of my life away from me.  But I don't think being an addict excuses stealing from people, child abandonment, ect.  Thats just bullshit to me sorry.

I just want to know that she's alive. At this point, her kids don't really even remember who she is. And that has to suck for her, but at the moment, it's better for them.A mom[removed]Oh man, why didn't I ever think of that?

*Just stop using drugs!*

Shit - you've just revolutionized mental health care!

Man, no one is saying, *"Yeah, fuck my kids. Heroin is way better than those brats."*

That's what addiction means. To be so fucked in the head that you realize the shit is no bueno but you still keep doing it. It's not a matter of being a low life - it's a matter of being mentally fucking ill.
Couldn't have said it better myself, when it comes to kids, you need to be willing to sacrifice your vicesThis 100%. 

The moment you have children you agree to put their needs and wants above your own, that doesn't somehow exclude drugs for addicts. > People down-vote because this sub is full of addicts who... think using drugs is an excuse to be a deadbeat parent.

Really? You don't think it's because you said "I fucking hate people like your sister"? You've been here for four years and honestly think more than MAYBE a couple of outliers would agree that dope is worth abandoning your children? Come on. You haven't been reading the same r/opiates as me.

You mention your clean time... are you in a 12-step program? If so, I would encourage you to maybe write about this and share it with your sponsor. You've some step 6 & 7 to work on.

Nevermind. Now that you've clarified I agree with you. I'm sick right now because I'm putting my family first.It's more of an established psychological fact than opinion, my man.

The very point of addiction is that no, an addict can not control their symptoms through free will. That's literally the diagnostic criteria - that even though they know their actions are destructive they still do them. They compulsively use drugs even though they wish they could stop.

To say otherwise is kinda like telling a depressed person to just be happy. I'm sure they wish they could be happy, but there's literally something fucked in their brains preventing that.I'm so sorry, I really am.  How long has it been since you've heard from her?Seriously?

GTFO of here with your b.s. negativity.  It's not welcome at all in this sub or any other sub for that matter.yeah, jesus christ.  this is so true.  do you think i want to shit on my children's lives?  I'm fucking trying here.   i got 4 months clean, but i had 20 years not, which includes the lives of my children in their entirety.  I'm trying to be a good dad but i do still have a pretty gnarly addiction.  thank god my wife is clean.Rebuttal winsOpiate addiction isn't a vice. I wouldn't wish this shit on Satan himself.>  MAYBE a couple of outliers would agree that dope is worth abandoning your children? 

Huh?  What do you mean?  Those are the low life scumbags who don't want to take responsibility for their own behavior I'm talking about.

And no, no disrespect to working the steps but I personally got clean own my own.  I have no idea what the steps are and don't really care tbh.What I mean when I say "control symptoms" is with free will a drug addict can stop using drugs.  That is indeed possible, people do it every single day.

The worst symptoms of addiction come about when we use and using is technically well within our in our control and free will. That is an absolute truth.Almost a year. A day after the judge took her kids from her, and gave them to me. What the fuck do you think vice means?Perfect example of the different between people who work a program, and ones who get "clean" on their own. 

People who do it on their own are usually still pieces of shit, just without the drugs - or just without some of the drugs. smhYou are an angel on earth for taking care of them. We need more people like you, sending love and good vibes. Thank you for being you. Wow, what an emotional and horrific experience that must have been for you and her too, even if she seemed to not care or was indifferent because of the drugs.

You are a great and beautiful soul to have the love and capacity to care for those children, if there were more people like you in the world we all would be so much better off.  As a mother myself, thank you, thank you so very much for your complete selflessness and immense amount of love you've bestowed on them.huh? I'm a piece of shit because I'm against child abandonment in favor of using drugs?

Yeah, that makes sense..  Typical junkie loser mindset. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Funny Onion post, Content: , ups: 585, downs: 0"Getting these lethally addictive drugs into the hands of vulnerable communities across the country is just something I do from time to time for a little profit -- I can drop it whenever I choose", said Arcelis Pharmaceuticals CEO Paul Corrier, clawing at his sweat-drenched shirt as he insisted he could "quit in a heartbeat" if generating billions in revenue by misleading the public about the dangers of opioids ever got out of hand. "Sure, every now and then I'll launch an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at getting doctors to over prescribe fentanyl sprays, but it's honestly not a big deal. Seriously, it's fine. Just because I'll occasionally partake in making money off the devastation wrought by drugs hundreds of times more potent than morphine doesn't mean it controls me. "

Their articles are such a fine line between fiction and nonfiction. Let's face it, this is pretty much already how reality operates. �Ah shit i wish i still had it, i remember i retweeted one from The Onion awhile ago but they had some headline that said

EDIT:found it..

-Study Finds Majority Of Accidental Heroin Overdoses Could Be Prevented With Less Heroin-

BALTIMORE—According to a study published Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the majority of the nearly 9,000 accidental heroin overdoses that occur in the U.S. each year could easily be prevented if the victim were to take less heroin. “Our data clearly showed that, in more than 95 percent of cases, had the individual used a smaller amount of heroin than they actually did, their chances of overdosing on heroin would have been significantly lowered,” said the study’s co-author Natalie Czerbett, adding that the results were the same regardless of whether a reduced quantity of the drug was snorted, smoked, or injected. “While these findings are by no means a silver bullet, I think it’s fairly conclusive that putting less heroin into your body is a highly effective preventative measure against overdosing on heroin.” Czerbett suggested that further research was needed to determine whether heroin overdoses could be reduced even further by mixing the drug with less cocaine.I saw this on Facebook today and literally spat out my drink. Hit way too close to home in the funniest way possible. The Onion really is fucking genius. Pretty great. Anyone heard that podcast(might have been this am life cant remember) about the creative process at the onion? Super interesting. Apparently its super intense, the writers go in front of the editors or whoever is in charge, and one by one read their proposed headlines. The guy telling the story says that the editors pretty much never laugh and will simply say something along the lines of 'thats horrible' or 'very funny'. Im not recounting it very well but what i gathered was their very strict editors are a big part of the reason its so on point The onyo.I saw this on Facebook today and literally spat out my drink. Hit way too close to home in the funniest way possible. The Onion really is fucking genius. It's fucked up because it holds more truth than most "real journalism" about opiates. http://www.theonion.com/article/study-finds-majority-accidental-heroin-overdoses-c-51992That's gold Sounds interesting, any source?Fucking hilarious  so true I'm stealing prolly repost10/10 won't OD againI didn't think you could OD on weed?I sure can try tho haha @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Too true, Content: , ups: 583, downs: 0Yup and it pisses me off sometimes but we all know we are the ones doing it . id probably be pretty careful about customers knowing where i lived if i sold drugs. people kill people over practically nothing these days.The best are the ones who spend the money on guns and show you their guns then you get too paranoid to go back lol[deleted]Yea....full top row of gold teeth...lmao i know a kid with sickle sell and he gets a bunch of pills and i use to spend like 1500$ with him the first of every month then like 3 hours later we would post all these videos of shit he just bought on snapchat With a $600 a day habit my guy just bought a house. No joke. He told me he “worked hard to save the money to buy it”. He is lucky I don’t have some one cheaper or he would be back to the house. Hate this shitty fr like thinking bout all the money I gave my main dude damn ,, when I was doing Brown I didn't even have money for food or clothes but plug didn't even use and on FB he would flex buying new phones and clothes getting tatted up all time and shit, he was cool tho gave me a sub for free when I was sick :)No what’s worse is seeing a. Bad ass jaguar car  in front of the trap all I can do is shake my head because it stands out like a sore thumb 
    Flash lil much...haha[deleted]SighHow about growing your own poppies?Yeah, a bunch of shitty jewelry and random electronics lmaoI think money spend for drugs is more usefull than for bs like gucci stuff.. 
Yep it’s been a long time since I’ve actually met anyone in a house. It’s all meet ups these days. It’s pretty much safer than having traffic at the house. Risk of getting pulled over but better than getting a house raided. These days?They started this trend in ancient roman times. They always left the tags on their marble statues and purple tunics. or they want to wear it and return that shit cause they just spent $250 bucks on a Gucci t shirt, a fucking t shirt, maybe a little better quality made than your normal run of the mill t shirt but at the end of the day its a t shirtI never understand that either. Why the fuck would you keep a tag on something? It's ugly and in some cases uncomfortable. The *only* thing I can think of is they're wearing things they want to resell later and figure keeping the tag on it will fetch more money. Supreme and other hyped brands especially.Lol, I'm with ya on that bud, I'm gonna be 50 on the 10th, and when they started wearing the starter hat, flat bill to the side, ( as mines slightly U shaped & centered)  w/ price tag dangling , and gold starter sticker still in place on the bill..? I'd just look in wonder and hand over my 100$ bill and go about my biz, as he rode off to do the same...Oh well, to each his own,  I'm sure when he rode off , he had his own thoughts of myself,  lolLeaving the tag/sticker on a sports team hat is like this to me.  If you leave the tag/sticker on there that is 100%, undeniably left on for other people to see.  It isn’t for you. It is a choice made solely to impress others. So corny. I’m 21 and I’ve never seen anyone do this Leaving tags on clothes and stickers on baseball caps has been an urban AfAm / hood / ghetto trend FOREVER. 

The idea is to show off to other blacks and to signify to whites also. This fashion sentiment is left over from just after slavery when newly freed slaves earned their first wages and tried to showboat by purchasing fine wardrobes. 

Yes.

It is.  -___-

Back then (late 1800s), the Republican party supported civil rights for AfAms; the Dems opposed the concept. 

something something carpetbaggers 

I forget 

Since the early 90s at least. Theres a few different theories how it started. Buy expensive shit, leave the tags on, return it. Although I dont buy that, sounds like something made up after the fact. Like sagging started in prison to signify you're dtf. Just a story made up so people can look down on those who do it. Also some people think it's to show the product is legit and not a knock off/show off how much was spent. But I dont buy that either...it was just a trend that caught on. Sticker shiny, sticker stay on hat. wow that is awesomeGet it was tagged “work hard play hard ;)”Fuck me, 600 bucks a day. Pills? Cause i cant imagine someone spending that a day on like h or anything besides maybe leandont be jealouscause he bought a house... your 600$ a day isnt enough for him to buy a nice house (about 200k a year minus expenses isnt enough to BUY a house) youd be surprised how many people spend money as good as ur or more... if you leave hed take a hit but could certainly still afford the house> but plug

Hah. Yeah I was in jail and prison with a few people that said they would do it. All sorts of shit, pretty much anything you can imagine. It was mainly for heroin and crack or meth, and the stories were just crazy. 

I’ve lived both ends though, not on that, just being a straight up junkie to making pretty nice money from literally starting from scratch. It’s just the way it goes I suppose. We just do it to ourselves. [deleted]I've had both.   I had two main dudes - polar opposites.  One, I spent $$ with everyday for  a YEAR, STILL never saw his place.  Other guy was like a damn convenience store - sometimes I'd walk in, there'd be two dudes at the table, I shit you not , selling a fucking BOULDER of H. sittin on a scale... an AK-47 laying on the couch, poeple in the room next door recording rap songs, folks outside smoking - it was wild.  Dude was a one stop shop for any drug you could think of - and if he didn't have it, he'd find it.  He always had someone "at the door," like a bouncer, checking people in and out, whihc was gated; he also had cameras everywhere on the outside of house, "to prepare for break ins;" it never happened when I knew him, but it's been years since I've been over there.  or home invaded by drug seeking violent criminals aka the cops - tombos de mierdaand Guild tabardsMore like 500-800Or things they plan on returning back the store later for a refund lolProof they bought it instead of ripping the tag and stealing it. That and the price being high enough means it's legit. [deleted]Bro... No. Just. Only quiet time nowWhat are you 12 ?I don't remember this being a thing, like at all, in the 90s and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a thing in the late 1800s either.

Afaik it's something that got mainstream with affluent millennials, non-affluent people who did it before that mostly did it so they could return the stuff to the store after showing off with it.Could be heroin and coke easily. 600$ would probably have you shooting all day Oxy 30mgYou only need %15 down to buy a house. 600 a day is a shit load of money when a typical mortgage is only a few hundred a MONTH. he could easily buy a house making 600 a day from just one of his customers. Are u 12 ���I never said I was, and I take responsibility for my actions, I live a totally different life now. What I meant was id be out there miserable stressing, stressing shit, lost my job, almost lost my family had no car. Then id meet up, dudes in a nice ride with 22in wheels, loud ass system, wearing new clothes, probably ate dinner every night, and gets laid. My problem was that I saw the bigger picture for my self, and decided to make a change. 

If the shoe was on the other foot, id have a hard time selling shit like dope, knowing that people were ruining their lives over it, I'm not a Philanthropist and I'm not going to do anything about it, it was just my two cents.U was at the trap ! LmaoAnd epic wooly mammoth vendor mountsI spend some money on some nice designer expensive type shit, but spending that much on a t shirt to me just makes no sense, like its a fucking t shirt, and im not gonna spend that much on a t shirt then wear it with my stupid ass broken in Levis jeans lol

just seems really dumb, all these hype beast kids who have no money in their bank accounts but they just HAVE to walk around in a $1,000+ hype beast designer outfit.... sometimes I see these rich ass asian kids walking around in balenciaga shoes or a MCM backpack or some shit and I so badly wana follow then and rob the shit outa themThat's also a possibility lolThis.  This is the exact reason. Thx alot man. Well being as I'm turning 50, not a whole hell of alot, on the partying side anyway..Working on sobriety these day's ..I think the kid's are taking me to Long Horn Steak house..So I can beat down a fat New York strip I suppose..I'm grateful tho..I could be taking the eternal dirt nap..lolShowboating and signifying == crucial to poor people worldwide since the dawn of man. Leaving price tags and stickers on is just the AfAm flavor of it. For example, back in 1990s NYC, stickers were left on flat bill baseball caps to prove authenticity.

(Old money does not have to brag about how new and expensive items are. Old money often values antiques and understated fashion.)
I remember it in the 80's and 90's.Bro it's time to try heroin. You could cut that amount in half at minimum. Or get on methadone and spend next to nothingYou spend six hundred... a *day*?

I mean, you do you. But like, I could literally live on $600 a day. Damn, dude! Lol. Congrats on your financial success!maybe. you got me there. still tho i doubt he bought his house only thanks to you.Haha. It appears that way. My minds humour age anyway. I hear ya.Basically, except he was the only house on the street, so it was kinda secluded like there weren't a bunch of randos standing around outside slanging everywhere - this dude was the dude *those* guys *came* to lol.  I felt bad cuz the first time I went over there I thought I was fixin to get jumped or something cuz it looked so sketchy, I texted my friend, who was like "nah man, that's his *house*" lol. :/ !!  Gotta live it up while you can mfs die everyday People of all walks of life like to show off, how they do it just varies. Some people of lower-economic status do like to keep tags in clothes to show off when they finally get a little bit of money. Hence the tags on clothes, the bling, and the stickers on baseball caps. But it’s definitely not confined to African Americans. You have plenty of white people who do the same or who buy the car that’s worth 3 times the value of their small, dilapidated home. Middle class folks, too, like to show off. Some do it with expensive watches or maybe with that well-places Ivy League sticker on their car or the ubiquitous Harvard sweatshirt. Even wealthy people like to put out signs of how rich they are to compete—are you following the new esoteric trend? How many seats does your private plane have? How big is your yacht? Etc.  No plug.  I am obviously a successful business person (not bragging just a fact of discussing an expensive habit) and I don’t really run in those worlds. I have one plug and I stick with him. Could live pretty comfortably, that's like $219,000 a year.We all get stuck at the age we start doing drugs I'm super imature too so is whatever lolDont...that's so fucking stupid. I'm a successful "business person" as well. Learn TOR and buy online. Or fucking quit jesus christ. You have good health insurance talk to a dr. and get on subs. But honestly, if you're intelligent enough to be as fortunate as you are you can network with some docs to prescribe you pills. That's insane man.
Wow... 600 a DAY?!?  even if you're paying a dollar a mg (which is a gyp, imo), that's 600 mg, or 20 30s??  Umm... I guess it's possible...  BUt yeah, as others have said:  yo could cut your costs in half (or better) by switching to H, or, as mentioned, try methadone.  I've never heard of a 600$ a day habit on just opiates.  Never.  And if you're paying more than a dollar a mg, you're getting screwed (and even that is high, imo)Yeah, 600 a day is a pretty nice living wage lol.  I could live on less than a tenth of that lolOh I am there and have gotten sober a few times.  I am about to try again but my issue is going from these oxy (really fentanyl) to subs. The half life on the fentanyl is 3 to 4 days of hell.  I will get there though. Besides the money I am sick of the life. I know I am getting screwed but I am to lazy and don’t run in the worlds to get a new plug. You ready to hear the ultimate screw job?....$40 per 30mg. I used to spend $125-$250 per day on my habit. And that was light spending considering what sub were in. And that was only because that’s what I was limited to by what I make from work. I could have easily did $600+ a day too if I had the cash to back it up. But I got tired of dropping that amount every day so I forced myself to be happy with $60-$75/day initially and now currently on a $40-$50 once a day with plans to halve that again in the coming months. Got tired of handing over a thick stack of 20s every other week so I dropped myself down and forced myself to be happy with the small buzz once a day. Sucks, but it sucks less than handing over that big of a wad of cash for sure. And it takes a lot of willpower to not buy more after work or whatever and sometimes sleep suffers. But you gotta control yourself, definitely. Especially when you’re hiding that kind of habit from work and family.I was literally in the same boat. Same drug of choice, the means to buy them etc. Get a high dosage of subs. Cut it into .5 or 1mg strips and after 24 hours start taking them slowly. Start with the .5, if you go into PW. Wait it out. With such a small dose itll be 30m to an hour. Take a larger dose of subs. Slowly increase. All PW is - is the bupe kicking everything out of the receptors. 

You got this man. Good luck.Jesus. I live in a small town hours from the nearest city so you can imagine the prices in my area are already marked the fuck up. Yet I can get an oxy 80mg for $40. That’s nuts. $40 CAD at that. It’s $25/6mg of Hydromorph here. $125/30mg. Expensive. DNM or find a new plug with the amount you spend. Never mind about switching to H as these guys say. Sure, you’ll save half initially. But your tolerance will grow and you’ll be spending that same amount on H in the long run in no time. Or you need to just lower your daily intake to a strict amount and just be happy with a once a day normal dose and stick with it. Drop your tolly by taking a tolerance break. Save your cash. Of course, all easier said than done and it’s your money and your life. Good luck bud. I was paying $100 a bundle for 10 .1 bags. I'd do that in 6 hours and get another. I got a connect for 200 a G and I did that in a day. Asked for 2 he's like no way you can do that much. I said no I can't do it all, I'll save a bump for the morning.Yeeeikes.  Man... that's ...  wow:(  You *really* must be a very, very cautious person!Oh, definitely.  Yeah, when I was using like that, a half a day, minimum, which got down to ~ $60 a day.  But for sure, when I had my druthers, I woulda used triple that, easy.  So I could imagine a $200 per day habit, easy - especially if you had the funds, even another two times over from that - but 5 - 6 hundos a day?!?  Either you're gettin gyped, or.. idk.  That's exterme.  

But beleiev me, looking back, I used to be in amazement at myself that I was able to come up with so much cash ever day lmao.  It was sad.  Fucked up thing is, even though I'm not doing that now, I *still* struggle to pay the bills and eat lol.   @@@@@@@@@@ Title: And I would’ve gotten away with it too if the suburban kids didn’t OD, Content: , ups: 584, downs: 0Seriously fuck anyone who cuts xanax with fucking fent. Just, why? Why would you do that? What good can come from killing your customers? Fucking retards.And that's why I only buy my xans from plugs wit scriptsHas anyone considered maybe they just used the same press to make fake oxys then made a batch of xans and didn't clean it good#ThishappenedtomeAre xans even worth taking?I knew it that bumbling bastard made me itch when I took the bars. good thing I took my scooby snacks in moderationtitle gave me a wee giggleRIP LIL PEEPChrist. I feel bad even upvoting but that shits too good lmao It don’t make any sense to me to press a Xanax pill with fentanyl.

They’re not even in the same class of drugs. But hey people are putting fentanyl in literally every thing nowadays He can't do that, shoot him or something!I just lost a closw friend from college to a relapse after many years clean off dope. They are suspecting it was a fentanyl overdose. This makes over 25+ people that I have lost since 2009 from opiates and its fucking ridiculous.LolIt's one of 2 things, either accidental cross contamination, or they put it in the bars as a cheap filler and as a secondary way of keeping customers hooked on their particular bars so they don't stray to another source, as they are hooked on 2 chemicals not just xanaxFuck anyone who presses bars period. But yeah. Sometimes it’s plain fentanyl. No alprazolam. That’s dangerous too, because people will have benzo withdrawals. Rip lil peepTrue but the person buying them should always test their shit.YesIf your resposible with them and never drink on them especially with no tolerance. Major blackouts and doing dumb shit is why.Xans are never worth taking Bro they’re puttin fent in the coke these days. Everything. These people just wanna get people hooked and have no clue what they’re doing. I was in Camden county jail in jersey and talking to these corner dudes and they’re laughing about it just randomly mixin in fent and seein what happens when it hits the block...”fiends droppin” is a joke to them and brings more businessStill so dumb.I dont believe at all that they would use it as cheap filler when they could literally just use an inert substance as filler for practically free. The only thing that makes sense to me is to get em hooked on fent.is Fent. really that cheaper than China benzo? shit costs like 90 bucks for 500 bars darkwebHonestly alprazolam is one of few great drugs to press. Alprazolam powder is cheap, comparatively easy to get and it has a much wider range of safety. Well compared to any opioid that is.

I wish someone would figure out how to make bathtub oxycodone.Nothing wrong with presses man, but fuck anyone who advertises them as pharmaLol you would never see a real bar again if they didn’t have pressies. 90% if all bars are pressies. I prefer pressed bars to pharma, and i get both 1mg footballs prescribed, but i also can buy 4mg presses for 5$. If i buy a pharma bar i still pay 5$ and only get 2mgs. I try to stay away from buying bars though i always end up with a slight habit. Though around christmas i bought 8 presses and 2 pharma, i know they were pharma because no one pressed those new Y 2's and had 8 green hulks that are pressed at 4mg even though sometimes i honestly think its closer to 5. Lets just say they lasted me a month i dont take xanax to get barred out more for legit anxiety or hangovers although im trying not to drink anymore,drinking is not worth what it does to my body plus ive kindled so much a weekend bender and i get withdrawl feel like shit until the next thursday. Alcoholism is fucked.Exactly. And jesus christ I imagine the odds of getting a poorly mixed batch of pure fent passed off as xanax would be pretty high. Especially if they're the kind of retard that's cutting their shit with fent in the first place, I wouldn't trust them to properly mix a batch.I bet fentanyl would stave off withdrawal pretty well in someone that doesn’t have a opiate addiction.

Not defending the practice, just an opinion.It's a sad world we live in where we can't trust our dealers not to kill us with the drugs we pay them for. It's just bad business to kill off your customers, but nobody looks at the bigger picture. They just see immediate profits and dont give a shit about long term investments.Yea that shits fuckin sick honestly. I was a ice kinda guy, but I did have a love for opioids. But when I was using ice there was rumors that people were putting fent in that. And I was like “why tf would someone mix a very potent opioid with a very potent amp” . Shits astonishing, and for any of y’all still using bro, stay safe out there � Fent in xans is for the most part non existent, this whole fent xan thing had been completely blown up by the media but no one has stopped to actually think about it, first off putting fent in xans  just sounds retarded on multiple levels, number one it would cut profits significantly, like by 20x and anyone with the intention of doing this is clear out for money grabbing and losing profit is not a characteristic that youd expect, secondly they are addictive on their own an extra boost from anything would just be unneccisary much less fent powder, 3rd it just doesnt make sense from a pressers perspective, i mean bars are already small grained so use of extra equipment press it is already required to make evenly dosed bars so fent being even smaller granules would be much harder to press without making bars have massive hotspots and cold spots. Aside from all that people who take bars and oxys are a pretty similar demographic and a lot of them take em together, i believe since a lot of oxys are fent pressed that many of these cases get blamed om xanax when alprazolam is found in their system along side fent as is what happened to lil peep, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/police-crime-lab-tests-identify-seized-pharmaceutical-drugs-as-being-fake%3f_amp=true there were seizures of these oxys in the area at the time roughly of the lil peep concert about a month off, and unsuprisngly on the list of drugs he had takin it was stated mbox 30s were part of it, this im pretty sure was the main event that sprialed media sources into creating other news around "fent laced xans" as i never really saw articles over it before which wasnt even a fent laced xan event, the more likely option of why people say they tried fent laced xans or said they know they go around because theyre friend had a couple bars then completely got slumped the next day is prolly due to a different epidemic thats also going on where most of the bars pressed are actually 4mg now, they could be taking two blackikg out or just getting slumped and preaching about it being fent xans, which seems likely since about 90 percent of bars people get in bulk are pressed and almost all pressed bars are 3 or 4 mg granted the impurities in chineese made alprazolam vs pharna might mitigate some of the high dosage not all of it and they are still taking a dose thar they might not be famailar with before if they are used to pharma, the more likely cut for bars people are getting are cheaper alprazolam alternative rcs like etizolam or fluroalprazolam which is more potent than alprazolam and only requires about 1mg to be stront feeling of that and since they are not the same substance but took less and got more fucked up then usual they may have thought it was fent due to everyone preeching its common, eitherway in the end you should worry about it too much as if it is happening its not very popular at all.Fiends dropping=Customers dropping=money dropping. Possible manslaughter charge too if linked back to you. They sound like geniuses. There's a big enough market for fent, just sell it as such.It isn't dumb. Cruel? Yes. Bad business? No.

They get more overall profits from addicted customers, so, they don't mind losing a few.Dunno about it being a cheap filler, but I would guess it would make the users think they were stronger than normal?

IDK I'm no expert, and I only rarely get or take benzos.Idk. I like the ones my pharmacist gives me. It’s also astonishingly easy to get benzo scriptsI tried H while CT WDing from diazepam. By day 7 I felt like I was going insane with psychosis. I had next to 0 tolerance then as well. It was maybe my 3rd or 4th time buying a G of H (which used to last all week dosing everyday) with a few months break. Thought an opi habit is probably going to be easier to kick if I can get through the acute phase... i literally couldn't function even though I was really high on H. I guess that's what happens when you abuse gabaergic substances for like 10 years straight.Totally agreeFacts but it has happened. I 100 percent agree but still, be carful. You don’t wanna be the one unlucky gal or guy...... or maybe you do but hopefully ya don’t Logically, yes. Morally, yes. But I’m talking corner boys in open air drug markets in the hood where these dudes don’t know you from the next. Where people hear there’s OD’s off a certain batch, they flock to that corner in drovesI swear to God if I ever get a pressed xanax cut with fent I'm gonna find the dealer and he's gonna need all the fent he can get once I'm through with him.I’m saying on the street most people don’t know anyone with a scriptPlease give pointers. All my docs seem reluctant. It was incredibly hard for me to get my 10 Ativan a month script... And I actually have anxiety and panic disorder.Ya i get 90 10mg valium and 30 1mg xanax a month but have to see my dr everymonth. My dr would rather me on benzos than drink the way i do. Although i do not take 3 valium a day more like 1 maybe 2 on a bad day. Im usaully fine with just 1 valium in the morning and if i have a panic attack ill take a xanax. They say 10mg valium is equal to .5 xanax but i dont beleive that at all if i took 40mg valium at once im going to be way more fucked up than if i took a bar or 2mg. Valium is a great under rated benzo for anxiety and many other things. Ive tried my fair share of different benzos in my life top 2 are valium then xanax, also depend on situation i guess 1 valium in the am and im anxiety free all day. It took me trying out ssris and all tht other shit and a few drs. To actually find one that realized im one of those people where when im not on benzos or dont have them as a back up my quality of life diminishes and i start drinking instead to self medicate and basically destroy my life with alcohol.For you. Can't get one to save my life.Familiarize yourself with symptoms of panic attacks and general anxiety disorder. But especially panic attacks, Xanax is a quick-acting, short duration Benzo so it’s supposed to be used on occasion for quick relief in emergency. If you gp is reluctant try a psychiatristOr you could say your a alcoholic and you need them to stop drinking for a while thats what worked for me. Although my dr is cool and knew of my drinking problem i was basically honest with her about a terrible relapse and shes been hooking it up. I dont drink anymore either so it definitely works. I’m in the same boat. My doc wouldn’t refill my Ativan script because I couldn’t come in every three months after I lost my insurance (lost my job). I finally went back yesterday and he made me feel like I was just trying to cop a script. 

Like.. wouldn’t I ask for something better? He had prescribed them them to me previously for panic attacks and nightmares (I have the most extreme terrible terrible super vivid nightmares 3-5 times a week). 

I mean.. I am an addict, but he doesn’t know that. And I don’t abuse benzos and I don’t think I look like an addict either. Aghh. He pissed me off so bad. That's how I got my xanax script as well, alcohol was about to put me literally in the dirt.Damn now I feel lucky to have a doc who gives me a benzo and addy. What a champion but holy hell did we go through a rough time. Dude straight gives me Addy 30mg IR from Concerta because I said I want something different and shorter acting. He mentioned it the previous time and I straight told him and he basically said, “Here find another doctor.” After my script ran out and I was trying to wean off hoping my insurance would give me another doc. They didn’t and sent me back to him. We had no real dialogue for two months but kept giving me the stuff. Actually still does till now and he’s just like “how’s it working or how you doing on these meds? Same thing again?” Umm yes please and I’ll show myself out, take care. “Uh huh.”

That’s basically it and I just scrap the Zoloft honestly. Only thing is how you doing? Good days and bad but I’m managing. Here and there get bummed but not bad. Okay let’s up the Zoloft. Sure thing doctor. God I been on benzos for years, opiates and now I’m going on like 5 months of Addy. Good times... to be an addict I was prescribed Ritalin for depression, once. It helped the depression, but I couldn’t stand the side effects. That's a risky strategy because it could backfire with the wrong phrasing. My experience was more or less the same, to a degree. My doc, who I've seen for years, knew that I had a huge problem with alcohol and thinks benzos are a lot alike and was afraid I'd treat them the same way I did booze. So after a year off alcohol she finally started me at 5 tablets a month, then 10, but anytime I request a refill I get it. So realistically I'm able to get 20 tablets a month. But I'm trying to get something stronger for the heavier panic attacks. Ativan is great cause it's functional, I can take it and still work, drive, talk to people normally, etc. But sometimes I have to take 2-3 tablets and that's a lot when I get so little.I cant take ativan im allergic to it weird i know. Ya man alcohol is one hell of a legal drug. Ill straight drink for months straight all day long still work and people cant even tell unless they are also a alcoholic.Make sure you do taper off adderall when you do, the loss of energy i had after just stopping after about 6 months just 20mg a day was terrible i didnt want to do anything. This was years ago too when i was younger and i bounced back faster but it was like i couldnt work or do anything. Ended up quitting my dead end gym job because of it which was actually a good thing though. Pre work outs werent even cutting it after 6 months on adderall. I could be different but heard others complain of the same symptoms. Ya my dr is just cool im honest with her and she helps me out alot. I couod see how that could go really bad lol.[deleted]That’s what you think Thanks and yeah my last mini binge wasn’t as bad. The ones before that though? Holy shit I wanted to sleep then just lay down for a week straight without movement. That saying about doing MDMA then having “suicidal Monday/Tuesdays” is spot on. I recently found out like a week ago or two that thanks to the stims sub which btw is a fantastic one. Shed light on the effect of making a person with depression worse after the fact since you’re essentially draining your dopamine and serotonin couple that with oxy and Valium which is nice with grass just adds another dimesion. Unfortunate yet interesting you mention working out. I had a killer six pack and now I still see my abs but not like before. I found out early on that another person mentioned. It doesn’t eat fat per se but muscle way more. Hence why protein and healthy diets with plenty of hydration is a must. This is coming from a guy who weighed 130 for 5 years then got sick and as a side effect gained almost 60 pounds at 5’7 which is stupid high. Changed my diet and started working out dropping it all and then some to 122-125 with definition and a core I can show off and no lie I try to since I have always been a tiny bit vain. I weighed at one point 112 pounds with no working out or nutritional diet on Addy. I haven’t had a craving for sweets since I decided to better myself, but now I’m eating stuff I never usually do. Then again everyone says just eat any god damn thing or you’re gonna die. Meaning I’ll get sick or messed up. My labs once showed my kidneys, liver and thyroid being elevated due to the Addy. I made sure to drink more water and eat at least before a binge and my labs are normal again. Weaning is a thing I can’t do especially in regards to my oxy since I suffer from chronic pain and I’m technically considered disabled yet you’d never know and some of my family doesn’t even know entirely either. The oxy and Valium carry physical depends which I say is far worse but given my history of suicide, depression and drug use the Addy also carries a sorta heavy psychological one. Yet I can take breaks from it and I can’t re up on it for a few more days, now two and I been out for nearly two weeks. Meaning my tolerance isn’t gonna be there and I better get more landing gear because knowing me I’m gonna go ham again a bit with it. I love doing stuff on addy especially playing video games when it’s late at night and normal people have lives or sleep lol

Oh my weight is back up to 121 now I believe as I been eating a bunch of random shot though I’m being more mindful now if sweets, fatty stuff and nutrition. Working out seems like the first time I tried running when I was a dough boy lol 
Cigarettes don’t help either though tbh Just ativan or lorazepam. Unless you know me sober most ppl cant tell im drinking. Im a better person sober anyway.Ah yeah that sounds familiar. I’m off it two years with a few hiccups here and there but I am definitely all the better for it.  Smoke a metric fuck ton of weed now so must look at that soon. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: What have I become?, Content: Me and my roommate were eating strawberries out of the basket they came in from the store. Before I could take the first bite he said " woah dude you have to wash those first" and I had to remind him that 2 years ago we were shooting fentanyl laced dope in a super 8 motel with a needle we shared with a prostitute., ups: 577, downs: 0Hahaha. That's hilarious. I've asked myself the same thingLolol everybody has their little codes and morals that they live with.

It's kinda like not giving a fuck about buying a $2 cup of coffee but pondering all your life decisions when it comes to buying a $2 iPhone app. �What happened in those 2 years that you can share with me to get it thru my thick, insane, selfish, stubborn and ultimately I guess just down right fucking stupid self so I can get off this hamster wheel. Before I die.I always have the same response when my friends talk about shit like "shouldn't be breathing in that air" or "you know thats got toxic chemicals in it?"  


Yea and 3 years ago we were cramming our noses every night with whatever looked like cocaine in a bag and sticking dollar bills up our nostril.I think about this daily. 

My old girlfriend and I have been seeing each other after a 5 month hiatus. We just got back from a holiday in Peru.

She made a comment on me eating a weird meal, I never even used to eat vegetables.

My response was “I used to eat meth”Maybe, the award of an opiate rush outweighs the dangers; and, by the same token, the extraordinary ease of rinsing strawberries outweighs eating a mildly dirty strawberry. Same universal principles at work.This is awesome.Yeah but that shared needle wasn’t going to give you cancer. Pesticides obviously can and will. 

PRIORITIES! 

/s

Yes I realize what you’re saying. Was also amused by this post.I went to a rehab years ago where my assigned task was washing dishes. Pretty rarely, someone would complain that a spoon was still dirty. Without hesitation, the lady who ran the kitchen would scream at them; you'd use that spoon to mix up heroin if you were still in the streets, wouldn't you?! They would never complain about anything kitchen related ever again lol.Does anyone else smoke cigerette ends when they're plum out of money and need a smoke?

I consider it building up my immune system from hundreds of peoples germs. I never get sick. My white blood cells are on high alert 24/7....my dearest friend....OP, I laughed pretty hard at this! Love it!

I basically go back to the list of drugs I have consumed when I have a, "I dunno, should i consume this?.." thought.

The answer is always yes �You've become someone that cares about themself.My buddy that was homeless living in a car with me would share rigs with me and whoever he needed to if we didn't have enough but was always super weird about drinking after someone else out of the same bottle/can/cupLmao I love this! I'm in the middle of a snorting bender after 4 years clean from opiates, and I gotta say this heroin life is boring now.Yea I always remember in rehab people would say oh smoking is bad for you and those people would be like bro didn't you smoke meth up until like a month ago?i used to do the same thing and be that person. but after shooting dope and reusing my needles more than i liked to admit to, i always tell myself ‘ive done nastier shit before’You've gone absolutely mad! You degenerate savage you.

r/madladsHave to leave a comment so I can see this on my page. So cute, bless.It's the devil you know, right?Pesticide doesn’t get you highI get it but I never wash my fruit anywayslmfaoo this is on pointLmao that analogy too realI have a personal policy of never paying for anything on the internet.

There's more than enough free stuff.> It's kinda like not giving a fuck about buying a $2 cup of coffee but  pondering all your life decisions when it comes to buying a $2 iPhone  app. 

holy shit lol i need to keep that one in mind while budgetingBut you're washing away all the flavor.![deleted]I've only ever used sterile spoons and proper water. In the UK they give you everything you need for free in a pack in most pharmacies (Any size needles, spoons, ascorbic acid for breaking down #3 Heroin and alcohol wipes)

However, I have seem impatient people use water from terrible places to mix up.. puddles? Dude, just wait 5 minutes or ask any bar or restaurant for a glass of water.. even McDonalds will give you a glass of water in a paper cup if you ask. Just don't get it and make a beeline directly for their toilets or they might get suspicious. Especially if you're in a group of people all looking sick and sweaty!Oh yes. Although I take the tobacco out and roll it. I mean, gum disease is *contagious*, dawg.Haha.  I was at a friends place one night and he asked if I wanted to go to the bar down the street with him and his roommate for a quick beer. I thought it strange because he doesn’t drink and money is tight right now for him. I said sure so he , his roommate and myself went to the bar and each got a beer. And then went to the place in the outside bar where we could smoke. That’s when I saw his roommate going thru the ash tray picking out butts he could smoke later. That was the whole purpose of the trip. I mean his roommate really did want a beer but he also wanted to get a bunch of butts he could take home.  I was literally sick to my stomach watching him smoke one. I had a whole pack of cigs that I insisted he take. I’ve done some gross things but I couldn’t smoke butts left  by a bunch of random people.Everyone I know

Goes away in the endI mean... just cause you used to do stuff that was horrendously unhygienic and gross, does that mean you should just say fuck it and always do everything in a gross and unhygienic way? Never too late to change ... or something.What is?I heard agent orange gives you a nice buzzYour flair = 275 $uicide?word lmfaoooI have a personal police to.

The bar down the street actually started pouring water in the ashtray lolThis is sadly way too relatable to me. :/ living the heroin lifestyle. Everyone I knew from the old days, is dead.

"Pulling up" = getting gas


"2 min" = Waiting to reup himself let's not forget "omw" = "i might decide to show up at some point between now and next Tuesday"My guy yesterday said "omw" and 11 mins later was in my driveway!! YESChange 5 minutes to 20-30 minutes and 10 minutes to 45 minutes - an hour. I’m almost there = just leaving the cribThe “dboy” posts are my absolute favorite!!! Love that you guys post them �"Leaving now" = may leave today. Maybe not. Don't call cause I won't answer.Here= 85% chance it’s todayThese posts make me so grateful for my dude. This shit might happen once every 3-4 monthsGot my first ever gold from this post. Thanks stranger! 

Also I’m really happy with all the comments on here and it’s turned into a great post. Y’all the real MVPs This is why when I used to use, I always went to my guy. “Oh your out Xmas shopping? I’ll meet you at target” lol

Although sometimes waiting is inevitable, waited at jack in the box for two hrs, dgirl kept saying in a minute every 20min. After two hrs she was like just come over (it was a freaking block away!). I asked why didn’t you just let me come thru from the beginning? Oh I don’t know. I was nodding. Lol trueeee[deleted]I'm at the light. Umm, ok, after waiting another 15 minutes, I begin to wonder which light and whether it's in the same state. Pretty accurateMy adhd! *say something* = *lie*  
Insert Pikachu meme here-Yeah on a good dayThis would be incredibly on top of things for a dboy are you serious? “5 min” = 1-2 hours away loli feel bad but i guess i have been pretty lucky with dboys the longest i have had to wait is like an hour or two and that's rare (usually waiting for them to put a package together) maybe happens once every few months. they always meet me within ten mins of my arrival to the meet up spot but usually under five mins. they don't like either person waiting around because it arouses suspicion. my heart goes out to those of you that have to wait a ridiculous amount of time. :/This is the reason I am so happy I just show up to the trap motel now and knock on the door to get my shit. Sooo much better than waiting around and way better prices.that's ghetto-timeYep. I always add 4 hours to the time when my dude says he’ll be ready. That way I can actually do something else with my day besides waiting around. Hasn’t failed me yet."Where you at?" = Coming from another state after the re-up.That here I come bullshit always got me.Unrelated but that "Here I come" shit is the best one. You pull up to the gas station then your dude texts you here I come. Next thing you know you see dude pullin up on this little ass bicycle he just borrowed from some little ass kid on the block. Just very funny times lol.You shut your mouth with that positivity! HahaIn traffic = 1-3 hours

Leaving now = Turning my phone off until further noticeAccurate. When mine would say 30 min i knew it’d be a few hours. I'm here = At the Mcdonald's drive thru, will be there in 20 mins.same with my dude he always on pointSame here. I appreciate the dboys that their business as a LEGIT business and don't fuck around. My dude now is always waiting for me when I pull up to his place, I legit never wait more than 30 seconds before hes outside, usually hes out there waiting for me. The longer we sit around waiting = more chance of getting caught, and he knows that. Why would he want his money going to jail? Just wish all dboys thought like this.same here and only because i caught them during a reupI agree completely. The only issue with the dope game is they know for a fact that we WILL spend the money no matter how long they make us wait. Sometimes it works to straight up tell them you have other dudes but they usually have enough costumers to say fuck off. It’s stupid. 

I used to travel for work and the most legit business oriented dealers I’ve ever come across were the Hispanics out west. Those dudes had actual operating hours and had a whole detailed system for hustling. Pretty cool I know that one for sure. There’s a shell gas station near our meet up spot and his answer is always “passing the shell”. Even though it’s only 3 blocks from the spot, it’ll take 10-15 minutes usually. Lol you are such a loserMost of my dboys are the same way. Now I have dealt with my fair share of waiting. Especially with the cartel but my main plugs are almost always pretty legit on time.But despite knowing better, there's a tiny sliver of naive hope inside you that this time will be different.[deleted]Yep I waited so long at a spot one time that eventually a dude that lived on the street straight came to my window asking what the hell I was doing on his street. I had my GPS running for this exact possibility and told him I was waiting for a friend to send me directions to his house and that I’m not from here. He walked away finally but  I called my dude and told him that I’m finding somewhere else to meet up because waiting so long almost got me in trouble. Eh, that depends, if you're copping in the hood, then they know there's no shortage of other dealers for you to go to. Even then, sometimes they have a particular stamp that they know you're looking for so they'll still take their time and proceed to dick you around. Sometimes a motherfucker just has to wait. Maybe he's pushing his car? Yeah my dude is pretty legit too. But I’ve definitely had bad ones. Had a dude legit try and argue with me when I told him I’d been sitting there for an hour. Had text and phone calls to prove it but he was having none of it. I think I quit using him after that And it never isEverytime yeah my guy cuffs me 10g if need be I'm lucky though single grams from my guy is only 65 everyone else around here charges 100 I've been blessed lolThe best part is when you pull up on the block and are obviously waiting for drugs so you have the runners coming by your window shouting out whats good. I am always too paranoid but it always happens and I cant help but think why don't I just grab and get the fuck out of here already.And wait we do. I really don’t even get that mad anymore and he really doesn’t have me waiting too often. I have another guy but it’s a slightly longer drive and it’s not really any better. So for me it’s worth waiting a few minutes to deal with someone who I have a decent relationship with. He’s usually actually cool enough to tell me when he’s eating or has another run somewhere else. I’ve been with him for almost 2 years now and was pretty much part of his come up. He keeps people loyal by being on time and honest. Probably. What’s funny is I’ll tell him them I’m pulling up to the spot and he’ll tell me to let him know when I get there....umm dude I literally just said that I’m pulling up. But they’re so used to lying that he thinks I am too. He wants me to let him know when I park. So I’ll hang up and call him back immediately to let him know that I’m officially parked. Dboy antics are some shit for sure lol That's what's up.  And when I do tell one of my guys that I need to call someone else because they're taking too long and I'm in a rush, I've had them say ok, go ahead, call me later or something. And then I'm like, wtf, where could they have been and how far? Were they even planning to serve me in the first place? 

And then, all calling another dude might do is just reset the whole process and potentially take even fucking longer. Yeah, that shit is retarded, I just told your dumb ass that I'm pulling up. Not to some random block or a fuckin Wendy's, but to your crib, the place I come to every day that I said I was five minutes away from when I called you five minutes ago, brainiac. I swear, some of these dudes are a cunt hair away from being straight retarded. My dude sounded like he was having a fuckin stroke today, then gets mad when I can't understand him. Then he's like, nigga! and continues to mumble something incoherently. Lol, I hate this fucking lifestyle. Happens way too often to me too lol @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I saw this and thought of you all, Content: , ups: 570, downs: 0"Per-co-cet? I think I heard about that on the news!"Yes!!!! I always was like I've tried Tylenol and ibuprofen and then they would say let's try some Percocet and I'm like
Ok I've never had that before!! Wink winkUgh. I need to get health insurance. I'm actually starting to develop fairly significant back pain. Though the addict inside of me can't figure out if the pain would be easier to deal with if I didn't also want the pills to get high.

How I wish I could buy oxys OTC. What a magical world that would be if I could get the medicine I need and the inebriation I crave just by walking into the store. I wish I could just be an alcoholic or stoner.this made me laugh way harder than it should have.Whatever you think is going to work doc, I'm willing to try just about anything at this point.What doc? You're going to prescribe me enough narcotics to put down an elephant. Well I guess we could give that a try!This meme needs to die now because I've said those exact words everytime my pain Dr. has increased my RX over the Years! WOW. Peeps love their memes here. I guess it goes to show that despite our unique sense of community and togetherness, deep down we are all filthy, childish, meme-loving regular redditors!

ps i upvotedWhat you gave me before didn't really break the cycle of pain. Do you have something with less tylenol in it? Haha seriously. Even though my background's in chemistry, I always make a point to stumble over drug names like it's the first time I've heard it. But Tylenol upsets my stomach, do they make it without that?I was going through gallons of vodka like water before I got hooked back on the good stuff. 

Alcohol has too many calories ffs, add in any chaser, and your asking to gain weight.  Plus you always feel it the next day...

I tried switching to weed. Even bought an expensive vaporizer because I didn't want the smoke. It usually just made me feel stupid. Wish I was in a weed legal state cuz I've had amazing weed before with an awesome euphoria. So I know theres strains.

Honestly though theres not really anything that can repalce opiates :pAmen to that. Weed is legal where I live and I can't stand the stuff. And I can barely drink due to migraines. I have a pretty fast metabolism too so I'll probably need to take quite a few a day to really feel them- uh I mean to really help with the painCan you boof this??Have you met Meth? zYour new lord and savior for not feeling tired the next Day?   Or the next...Or the next......Or, well, you get the picture.I was an alcoholic for a quick minute and that was the only time in my life that I've gained weight. I have a super fast metabolism but I actually gained like 15 pounds in a month or two from drinking a ton of beer. I noticed when I could feel myself jiggling going up and down the stairs. Yeah I feel the same about weed, though it makes me anxious and overwhelmed on top of the stupid. But same about the legalization. I'd like to try out some different strains and see I can find something that fits me. My state will probably be in the last 10. We just recently got medicinal through and it's a very short list of conditions.What's with all this hating on weed?? It's a magical plant. There are strains out there for anything and everything you need, if you dislike one side effect or two odds are there's some weed out there without it.  Besides that, it compliments opiates wonderfully, and I vastly prefer it to cigarettes but enjoy smoking something when high so it's a pretty ideal fitumm does saying this actually work?? hahahahI got lucky.  When I was about 10, my neighbor kids, one is special now and the other is dead, stole a beer from their parents fridge, and hid it in the field behind our houses...... On a 100 degree day.... I can't even stand the smell of beer.  Their the same pair that kept me from smoking, same way,  stole some cigs from mom's purse.Some of us just don't enjoy smoking weed. I'm not hating on it, but anything you get here is going to be anecdotal. It gives me anxiety. And I live in a legal state and know there are other strains, just doesn't do it for me.I mean, I don't hate it if other people use it - to each their own! I've smoked a bit when I was young, but was never crazy about how it made me feel (just dumb, sleepy and hungry), had a bad experience on some edibles about a year ago (thought time was skipping backwards and I was losing my mind..lol!!), and I guess I just kind of gave up on it.

One thing about opiates is I don't find it effects mental clarity/ability to think (well, pre-nod off anyway). I feel like weed actually is lowering my intelligence while I'm high. 

I may try a _tiny_ amount of edibles again to help with migraine pain/sleeping, some people have recommended it for that.Fuck no, they'll give you the ol' "well let's just try out this dose first, we can always raise the dose later if we need to."*Dr stars to write script for opana*
"oh but Doctor... I don't IV"More like "well let's try the get-the-fuck-outta-here you stupid drug addict" �In this case, wouldn't it (this approach) work in the long term??Lol yes but opiate users and patience don't really go togetherThis is taking it too far imo. Doctors know what to look for. That's just one too many tell tale signs. Couldn't you just use (what ever you use now) and work on your GP (doc or whatever you call 'him/her' in states) as your 'side job'??Yeah it takes a while and its expensive in the beginning but can be worth if you are patient. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Solid Medical Advice, Content: , ups: 574, downs: 0My old next door neighbor was a cop.  He tried his best to work with the local petty criminals.  Once he was on the phone in his yard saying "I don't like arresting you either!  Have you ever tried not doing heroin?"
Unsigned... Of course. STOP BREAKING THE LAW, ASSHOLE!!Not better then my advise It's in all caps. You better listen to him OP! All my medical records are riddled with notes like opiate dependent, canibis dependence, benzo dependent, known cocaine abuser etc.Lol if only life was that simple.LmaoWell it's not a bad idea.Is it just me or does it sound weird when someone says "take heroin" it just sounds weird. "Take".. I prefer "do". **DID THE DRAKE VOCALS COME IN YETTTT**[deleted]I got this same medical advice after my second OD �It should say "man the fuck up"I've been to that hospital several times. Back  when I lived out there.....that piece of paper makes it sound so easyRight, because it's just that easy.Yes, this is what my last discharge papers say as well. HahahaNah.checks outOh I've seen this paper too many times lol. Yo I lost it at this! LOLI framed mine. Lollol my best friend went to the hospital and his paper said: diagnosis: chest pain from chronic methamphetamine use. Special advice for dylan: stop smoking methamphetamine. Haha I got the same advice typed up a few years ago from my doctor Wow ... That honestly makes me mad *for you*. 
I'm so sorry that happened to you .. >Have you ever tried not doing heroin?

OH MY GOD.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THIS?!?!?

IT'S SO SIMPLE!

THANK YOU KIND SIR! THANK U!!!!!!!!!11Yeah, it was probably one of the nurses playing passive-aggressive fuck fuck games. Underrated comment of the dayto BANG THAT SHIT?With all the fent related hospital visits and over doses on the rise they probably can just click paste when typing and that's what comes up lol. [deleted]Same here, it sucks. I don't like having that stuff written down anywhere concrete.

I've been off dope for over a year now but still drink quite heavily and use cocaine (mostly contained to the weekends) and I had to go to the doctor's recently for something unrelated to substance abuse. When the doctor asked me if I drink and how often, I was trying to think of a reasonable amount of alcohol to tell him (since I do still drink like an alcoholic on the days I do drink.... i.e. Memorial Day weekend was basically a 3 day party of being consistently drunk and horrifying everyone at the party) and j was like "hm maybe 8 servings a week?" And he wrote on the form that I have issues with abusing alcohol! I was thinking how does someone even actually get drunk with under 8 servings, and isn't getting a good buzz the point of drinking???polysubstance/pharmacy addiction or another popular one is the borderline personality and narcissistic personality disorder. so much of my file has not been discussed with me, kind of defeats the point in some ways. This was my first thought too!�That's Doctor Captain Obvious, M.D. to you!  Doctor just having a little humor.Well it is legitimate medical advice...[deleted]It's pretty solid medical advice. In general, it's pretty good for your health to not use heroin. Definitely no need to be so sorry or mad for him.Exactly. It's not the RNs job to tell us how to livetip top advice, like "stop being so anxious" and my personal favorite, "stop being so depressing all the time""fuck fuck games" Came here to post this, was my instant reaction. Nice. DuhNot going to the doctor is a foolproof way. Its one of those things you can only hide for so long. Unless you have an ignorant doctor or just get super lucky with circumstance when you have visits but IV drug use is bound to end you up at the doctors ER or clinic at somepoint.A lot of us depend upon our docs for our drugs. Like if i didn't hide my drug abuse from my doc where the hell would i get my drugs from?...I don't live in Baltimore, i live in the most expensive illicit drug country in the world by a mile. So hiding my use is essential to live.Yeah antisocial personality disorder yadayadaI mean it would be negligent of of the doctor not to recommend this.But your username!I guess I just overreacted a little or took the post the wrong way lol. It's just not that easy to "stop taking heroin". [deleted]u want sum phuk?The most solid advice to ever exist Also if you end up in an ER for a plethora of reasons, they 95% of the time run a drug screen if they take a urine sample. Then if you've tested positive for anything, even if you don't admit to it, doctors will mention it (or not) and put the instructions in your discharge packet in order to cover their liability and bill more! If you tell a doctor you smoke, the doctor can put in their chart "gave 5 minute smoking cessation" which puts them in another billing category, and all they have to do is say "don't smoke" or put in "quit smoking" instructions in the packet. [deleted]OZZIE OZZIE OZZIE OI OI OI

(if ur a kiwi i dont know what ur chant is)Loyal to the foil. I'm fucking dead.  for his health it's a good piece of advice to get off heroin. 
It doesn't say how easy or hard it will beIve had several friends and family members who are nurses, and they are hardly brain dead. They became nurse's because they genuinely wanted to help people, not because they couldn't cut the mustard at medical school. You obviously dont know what your talking about.Also, the bachelor's program for nursing is the hardest bachelor's degree to obtain. (feel free to Google it). The masters program is even more brutal. 

Also, I don't think you have a good grasp on the true meaning of co-dependency. Maybe just a liiiiiittle phuk?... Because i have a legit chronic pain issue i just abuse my meds. Don't shoot so how would he ever know. Better to prescribe to someone who needs it rather than be suspicious of every patient and then have people with legit pain issues kill themselves. I'd have killed myself a dozen times over since CP began if it weren't for opiates. Life quality was zero and the pain so intense that it was unliveable. But yes, the majority of CP patients end up with addictions, it's just the nature of the beast and I'm pretty sure docs know this but there isn't any other option.Lmao, nah Aussie man haha.[deleted]Yeah get a good grasp on the true many.My ex had a genetic disorder called hereditary multiple exostoses or something like that. Basically she constantly grew bone tumors. Can you imagine how painful that would be—constantly having your bones scraping and stabbing your muscles, ligaments, etc.? She was on Nucynta for a while and she recently had to upgrade to Dilaudid—I only know this because she called the pharmacy that I work at (probably forgetting that), asking if we had it in stock. Why she jumped straight past Zohydro and Kadian to Dilaudid is beyond me. But she once told me that she had Dilaudid once and refused to take it again because she knew that she'd abuse it. When I found out that she has a prescription for Dilaudid, it worried me a bit but she never wants to hear from me. Our breakup wasn't the easiest by any stretch of the imagination and I really really hope that her significant change in medication is completely unrelated to that.where abouts in ozIn each of my stints in detox, it was always the RNs and nursing assistants who were the most sneeringly judgmental of the patients. Noticably moreso than the MDs.Yeah fk CP it's fkn just the worst. I mean if she is she's taking Dilaudid she's almost certainly addicted, but rest assured being an opiate addict with CP and a script is better than having CP and no opiates imo. Won't be all that surprised if i use for life. Melb U?sydney bruzLame. Every Aussie on here is from the harbour or Radelaide.

This morning early into my shift we got dispatched to an overdose. We got there and he was in his late 20’s, his girlfriend and mother was there both sobbing. My partner dragged him out of the restroom while he was soaked in his own urine and not breathing. He began pushing narcan while i prepared a bag valve mask to start breathing for him. He came back to his mother and lover crying over him with angry officers asking him where he got it while he is covered in his own filth. As per typical he didnt talk to police and refused to let us take him to the hospital.

What they go through to just do their job is mind blowing. The amount of good they do and lives they save is acknowledged but what they go through doing it is not talked about enough. 

Unfortunately in this city there is a lot of EMS & Firefighters committing suicide due to PTSD. Just yesterday a 25yo EMS worker who lived around the corner from me killed himself. And last year there was several in one month. 

I know this has nothing to do with your post, but just as you care about the anonymous user out there, know that the feeling is mutual.Thank you for your kindness, and everything you do.I shared a room in rehab with an EMT alcoholic. He was in bad shape with heavy PTSD. We stayed up all night and shared stories. The shit that came out of him was to this day the darkest shit I’ve ever heard and it was all related to his job. Thank god for people like you and stay safe and try to remember to keep your mental health in check as well.thanks for this man, really. there have been days when the kind words of a random person on the internet was all that stood between me and a bullet to the head... or a relapse when I was trying to get sober... which based on the number of friends I've lost are often one in the same.

thanks for the work you do and the passion with which you do it, because I'm gonna go ahead and doubt that it's for the money.Should tell the cops to fuck off if they're angrily questioning someone who was basically just brought back to life.I'm on this sub as a pain management patient.  Used to take pills recreationally, but now I need then to function.  I've never done heroin but I can relate to what it's like to be dependent on opioids.  Thank you for your post.  It really means a lot to everyone.  

One thing that really bothers me is how the police behave.  A lot of people are scared to call because of them.  If you could please protect your patients and make them feel safe from the police you'd be making us feel a lot better.  I know I feel safe around EMS workers when I've been in a situation with them.  The police are supposed to protect us from danger, not get angry or threaten and arrest people going through drug addiction.  

Take care, be safe and thank you for everything you do!Don't think your in my country but still appreciate you sir.

Drug addiction comes in many forms from the ivy league adderall popper's, the construction workers reliant to manage their work related injuries to the stereotype walking dead junkies.

Behind each one is a personal human story, often incredibly sad story's.. Life and the world told them over and over we don't give a shit about you. 
Stories that lead them to addiction  but there still people. You should never look down on them because it really could be you! Or your loved one just like that.. Iv seen it.

Anyway we need more people in the front line services and in general like the OP.

We can bring the change! Anyone with any intelligents knows drug policy has failed and its time for radical changeNot all heroes wear capes, this one drives a big red fire truck. Thank you �you saved my life!! would've been two years ago  tonight!! thank you very much!!This is one of the best posts that I have read since joining Reddit. 
It’s nice to know that there are professionals out there who do care about addicts.Thank you. This post made me feel a little bit of hope."with angry officers" you should tell the cops not to be dicks and maybe they will get more cooperation. waking up to cops being assholes isn't going to get that person to open up. thank you for all you do i know being a first responder isnt easy.911 dispatcher here. Seconding. Please call if you need us.Thank you for saying this <3 I thought most public safety officers despised addicts.  I overdosed once, and now I'll have 3 years clean this Christmas. Some of us do change, even sometimes the ones you see every week, I'm sure you have your "regulars" lol.  We appreciate you.  Know that your effort isnt wasted bringing us back over and over again.  We do recover, and we're all creative individuals capable of change and success.  One time I heard a cop say that he believed an individual should only get to be narcaned 3 times before they had the right to let the victim die.  I'm glad not everyone is like minded to him...thank you for your work and your open mind <3I have realised how much i care for people after been revived by emt in my home in the u.k, if my partner was not giving md oxegyn for 36 minuites i would be toastIt’s professionals like you that can change peoples minds about the stigma of drug addiction, and how showing compassion is way more effective than the failed war on drugs attitude. Thank you for everything you do and have done.Nice Job! Be careful so u dont burn out with that much work tho.. I work nurse/construction (male), and ruined my health thru getting in dept and then heavily over-working.. cant really function much without opiates now cuz of health issues...Thank you, but not all firefighter/emts think like you..the real heroesYou guys are the best, thank you.Oding in front of my local emt has ruined my life is so many ways. I wish I didn't have to look like such a piece of trash while they were saving my life. Everyone I know locally has heard of my overdose and now everyone I call for law enforcement nobody takes me seriously. I've posted about getting my ass kicked by a black � and and wondered why the cops didn't help me. I I asked my older brother about it he's 35 I'm late twentys and he says that society feels like people who are constantly using drugs will OD eventually so these peramedics are sort of jaded because if they save you this time chances are they will eventually be too late one-day and find your lifeless body out there. Why would they invest their feelings In a person who obviously doesn't care about themselves. Ah long rant I'm sorry having to deal with cops again God I hate working down south. Murfreesboro rdThank youThank you, for every day you have the fortitude and love that u share, that u choose to give back.Police officers can be so aggressive with that shit. Like the dude just died, give him a break.I know it's My fault. They saved my life so I can't talk shit about them... They are why I had to spend a hundred on the fire departments donation day "feed the boot" But God damn the attitude the cops give me when the emt tells the cop they have been to my place before.... � � Yeah but both treat me like the trash that I am. I don't really know how I feel about it. They are upstanding citizens and I'm trash according to the copsThis was a beautiful message and you're a great human being. Were you saying at the end there that if we feel we're about to relapse we could call an ambulance to stop us?? Though that would be wonderful if that was the case, I feel as if the paramedics like yourself who would be happy to attend an addict about to make a terrible decision to try and help would be massively outnumbered by those who would see it as a waste of their time. Considering many paramedics already resent having to go out to narcan addicts when that's literally bringing them back from the brink of death, I'd imagine that a much larger amount wouldn't be happy if they find out they've been called just because a junkie is sick or about to relapse. However, the fact that there are people like you out there is enough to reassure me personally that not everyone sees us as scum. Usually we have to look to other addicts to get any kind of compassion or sympathy, so to receive it from someone who only sees us at our very worst and who hasn't experienced it themselves is uplifting, so thanks a lot for that. We need people like you if we're going to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic that's writing off huge swathes of the population, and I just hope that more people realize that your approach of kindness & empathy is far more effective in the long run than callous apathy, stricter punishments or "tough love". 

One little nitpick:

>Everyone deserves a shot

I can almost guarantee that when most people on this subreddit read this sentence, your intended meaning isn't the first one that jumps to mind! hahaYou’re pure class.Bless youThank you for your words, your empathy, and your service. Thank you.Thank you for what you do, OP. I had a similar experience happen. April 28, 2018 I overdosed at my moms house. She found me dead, lips purple face blue. She gave me CPR the entire time until EMT's / police arrived. My twin brother went through my pockets as soon as my mom found me, took the fentanyl and left the house. I'm so fucking lucky to be here, I was dead. My older brother is a firefighter/EMT 8 hours south of where my mom and I live. I'm so fucking proud to say I have been 100% clean since August 6, 2019. Life is getting better, and I've been going to substance abuse therapy classes 4 days a week (Intensive Out Patient, or IOP).

Again, thank you so much for what you do. You and all of your brothers and sisters are heros. For real.

Keep saving ppl man, I know it takes its toll on yall, so dont hesitate to get therapy if dark thoughts start creeping in. I survived a 12 year heroin/fentanyl addiction, and I've lost more friends that I can count on both hands.

Keep being a hero, OP. We're rooting for you. And please be careful, I know how easy it is to lose your life to a house fire collapsing/being burned alive. Please be careful OP ❤Thanks for helping out and caring. I have over dosed many times when I was using heroin heavily and it was happening so much that the emt’s were just sick of it and I don’t blame them. It sucks because the problem is not going to be corrected with this epidemic and “war on drugs” until some drastic Changes are implemented like decriminalize opiates in a setting kind of like a methadone clinic, and I just feel like it will never happen. Thanks again for saving life’s it’s awesome to know that there are people who care. Peace and love - ATLienIt's all good till you get the bill.“Everyone deserves a shot”. Anybody else immediately imagine shooting up?That sucks. Paramedics got a hard job. Obviously you mean well and most on here appreciate it. Personally whole "you're not alone/you can beat this/theres a light at the end of this dark road" sentiment doesn't do anything for me though. Kind of annoyed by it at this point actually only cause you see it everywhere from people who are part of this expectation by society as a whole that you should seek treatment if you are a active user. Its also a big reddit karma magnet... Not trying to be a dick but if that's how i come off i can live with the downvotes. 

You've got a good heart. thanks for being willing to put up with such a difficult job.I know first hand that what you say is true. EMTs saved my life on more than one occasion. I felt very guilty for troubling them. Thank you a million times over.This is so true, it’s heart breaking when I see the low self worth opioids seem to produce in people.   It’s all part of the mind tricks these drugs play on people to just make them come up with yet another excuse to destroy their lives with opioids. 

Most the folks here have many people in their lives who love them, care about them and worry about them. You are not a dirty junky in their eyes, you are their child, parent, lover, etc. in their minds. 

I’ve dealt with many people who have lost their children, siblings or significant others to overdoses. It is absolutely devastating and leaves a permanent hole in their lives. In many ways they are the true victims of the epidemic. 

Please just think of those people in your lives. If you hate yourself too much to care about your own wellbeing then think about theirs. Chances are there are people who will be devastated if something ever happens to you.you da real MVP. thank you for your kind words and all the work you provide ❤️2 cousins are Paramedics and ambulance drivers. They are the toughest two girls i know and mad as brushes. Their brother is a despatch operator due to having to get off the roads due to health,hypertension, no wonder.,he lasted nearly 20 years .I would like to say something to you. First and foremost, THANK YOU from the bottom of my HEART! I am 37 years old, and at 28 I was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer that causes Deep Bone Pain from my blood scarring my own bone marrow. I was a star athlete in soccer and baseball growing up, and also did boxing for several years. I had NEVER tried opiates until a DOCTOR PRESCRIBED them to me. I was on opiates for 7 years ,and asked my Doctors on numerous occasions, "WHAT'S PLAN B?" When I was put on these meds I whole heartedly trusted the Doctors and what they were doing. I was naive to think I could just stop something after so long, and wake up the next day and be fine. I quickly found out the Mental/Physical ANGUISH of Withdrawals. It is like NOTHING I have ever experienced in my Life. In saying that, when I approached my medical professional's (so I thought) they really didn't make the exit plan of getting of these pills a BIG DEAL. I was told it would be about 3 days of some
 "Discomfort" and that's it. BULLSHIT!!!! On Day 3 I was within seconds of blowing my Brains out, and I had never been there mentally in my LIFE. So back on the pills I went. Months later I was furious with the (HEALTHCARE) System we AMERICANS have in place. They get Rich off of turning naive normal people into pill junkies, but don't want to help when you decide your done taking them. The reason I'm writing this to you is because on numerous occassions my Wife had to call out the Fire Department in my Area (Phoenix Fire Dept.) ,and I was treated like a PIECE OF SHIT for trying to COLD TURKEY what a Doctor prescribed. An then some of the Fire guys just stare at you like, well you got yourself in this mess,so you gotta get yourself out of it. Again, I had ZERO understanding of what I was taking at first because this was before the big Opiate Epidemic Bullshit when I started them for pain from Cancer. Now that I've been through it, I really have LOST a lot of hope with anyone that takes care of people medically. EMTS, FIRE GUYS/WOMEN, NURSES, DOCTORS,ETC. THEY HAVE ALL FORGOT WHY THEY GOT INTO THE FIELD TO BEGIN WITH. EMPATHY IS LACKING SO MUCH, and most of them in a hospital setting have terrible bedside manner....but You are a breath of fresh air my friend. So, for that I THANK YOU more than you will ever imagine. ��Thank you for this. I'm a recovering opioid addict, but I'm friends with a lot of people in active addiction. When I was shooting up, I felt like my life didn't matter. I felt like if I were to OD I didn't deserve to come back, and in sure a lot of my friends feel that way, too."Everyone deserves a shot "

heh, kind of ironic to say in this sub given the topic.

&#x200B;

HOwever, thank you so much for the work that you do for your community. know that i and the other people on this sub appreciate your work. what you do for others on the daily is probably more than i have done for others my whole life. thank youThank you for existing, mate!This just brought happy tears to my eyes. Thank you, you’re beautiful ♥️Waking up from an OD surrounded by cops and emts was one of the scariest and most shameful moments of my life, and I absolutely could not have gotten through it if it wasn't for the genuine complete kindness I received from the emt who narcaned me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your attitude and what you do.I wish there was more people like you out there my friend. Thank you so much for your compassion and sympathy to addicts. It is not an easy life and is tough for both parties involved in an overdose. 

Please never change my friend.

God speed.The world needs you, thank you.Big Pharma got my Mom and Aunt hooked on prescription Oxy years ago. Neither of them actually needed it, but the rest is history and the law suits are finally happening. Unfortunately my Aunt switched to heroine and eventually did not make it. Took my Mom about 10 years to get off the Oxy but she’s now been off it for 10 years. When I was 13 we were grocery shopping and she overdosed in the middle of the grocery store. The EMT came and did what you guys do best. I’m very thankful for people like you. My Mom has made a full recovery since all of that, is re-married, owns a house, and got promoted to Operations Manager of a manufacturing plant. As much as I hope they bring down Big Pharma with these law suits, unfortunately it can never bring back those lost like my Aunt.Can’t begin to thank you for this post. I work as a mental health counselor and see so many people struggling with addiction who have lost people they love to drugs, primarily due to not wanting to face police and doctors who are judgmental and unkind. Your post was so empathic and kind. Thank you for everything that you do!This is the best reddit post I’ve ever come across!I'm too broke to give you gold that you deserve but this is better than nothing... ���Firefighters and EMTs are the real heroes. Cops can go fuck themselves.

Do you realize that 2/3 of unintentional overdoses would go away immediately if we ended Drug Prohibition? This is all due to not having a regulated legal market.

Addiction is a problem but Drug Prohibition causes 100x as much danger and 1000x as much violence. Addicts could work 9-5s and get high 3 times a day until they're ready to get clean. And meanwhile not fucking die off of a strong or tainted batch. You'd actually know what you're putting into your body.

This bullshit won't end until Drug Prohibition does.Funny how when they bring someone back with a defibrillator that is obese and eats them selves to death there is no guilt.  Same issue.  Addiction.  Just different substances.  Only issue is one is illegal so we morally condemn those that use heroin. Sad state of affairs for our country.  Thank you for your service and seeing the good in ALL people. Not just those that society deems worthyIt's all good till you get the bill.What I don't understand is the people who overdose multiple times and are known to first responders.  I think most of those people are likely suicidal and would likely kill themselves another way if there were no opiates. 
 I suppose they could be very wreckless and stupid never taking testers on a new bag.   The problem of fentanyl hotspots can be solved by volumetric dosing something that is a lot simpler than having the police come and narcan you.  I would imagine it sucks pretty bad to get narcan'd and a person would take measures avoid it.   I'm incredibly lucky that I have never had to be hit with it in 20 years of use.>*Everyone deserves a* ***shot***

Lol.Thank you, emt’s and an incredibly kind Good Samaritan saved my life two years ago in a dollar general parking lot, hit with narcan countless times and resuscitated, wish I knew who saved my life that night so I could thank them. I’m clean and able to help other addicts these days.KThanks dogg, your work and this type of  encouragement keeps people alive.  It’s a shame that the cops want to tag along and threaten people at one of the lowest moments of their lives but, the fact that another addict survived is the important thing.  Thanks and keep it up.In my home town, it seems like the majority of police officers and EMT have little man syndrome. I woke up w 5 EMT standing above me w an ekg machine on me. The one fuck purposely poked me 5 times for an IV line and said I should be used to it.I really do appreciate you saying that. I wish we could all be a little more open and care a little more about eachother.Good to see you doing well bro.He could be a dirty shitbagNo joke PTSD and alcoholism are both very prevelant in EMT’s enough that they warn you about how to handle rough memories while in trainingDefinitely not for the money, i work 2 Fire depts and a warehouse 90-100hrs a week to make ends meet. It’ll all be okay in the end, if its not okay then it is not the end. If you need to blow off steam or need someone feel free to pm me or comment right here and i will do my best to get to you in a timely manner. Lotta people in this world need help, you cant help anyone if you cant help yourself and youre no good to anyone dead. Chin up man.Yup. A fucking cop comes to me while I'm out of it in the hospital, just getting Narcaned for the umpteenth time, and his only concern was where I got it. I told.him I was sorry but I couldn't help him. I was very polite and respectful!
So the fucker gives me a paraphernalia charge. Like, I'm almost dead you fucking asshole.Or just don’t overdose fucking idiotsExactly. Police and drug laws are the exact opposite of the solution to drugs.

Drug Prohibition is like seeing one of your tires is low on air so you shoot out the other three tires to even it out. It causes 1000x the pain and death that the drugs themselves do.Glad to know you are still with us all, go drop some cookies off at your Fire dept! Theyll love ya for it!I’ll do my best man, hopefully you can bounce back okayNo they dont. We’re people too so theres going to be different opinions on it. However the fact is every single one of us took an oath to treat the patient without judgement to the best of our ability. Which means whether they feel the same as i do or not you will be treated the same. The mentality is changing.There are a lot of salty medics, the fact is whether or not they care they took an oath to help you stay alive. A lot of the guys I work with myself included have had days where it is tiring pulling the same people away from death over and over because of these drugs. Myself and a good amount of my coworkers do genuinely care but yes it takes a toll. You just have to remember why you got into the field and that is to help people. My Chief said to us that once you stop caring, death no longer phases you, or you hear the words structure fire possible occupants and it doesnt get your heart pounding its time to find another job. Im sorry youve had bad experiences with first responders. We are not all the same, we are individuals clocking into our jobs. I hope you are clean and if not i hope you do have the strength to get clean. Once you are stop by the fire dept. thank them for helping you, a lot of what we do goes without gratitude and if you show it there is a good chance you will change their perspective at least for a little while.Fucking cops man. I mean, they have to see that they're doing literally 0 good in the Drug War, right? They can't actually believe busting 1 of the 62 dealers in the city is going to actually accomplish anything, can they?

Honestly I dunno how someone could live life with that much cognitive dissonance. Shit makes my brain hurt to even consider.Depends on the cop. The one today lost his cool for a bit but ive had other runs where theyll sit down with the patient and talk it out, see how theyre doing before going into questioning. As for other people commenting how i should have told the cop not to be a dick, i cant. We are seperate departments seperate bosses seperate jobs. When you are on scene everything has to look as perfect as possible in public eye, if theres an issue you talk about it in private one on one. Never in front of the public. Keep in mind they are  just people going to work. If some random jackwad on the street youd never met before thought you were trash would you care? Id hope not. They dont know you man. I dont know you.I just know that a lot of the guys i work with understand its a real issue and we do need to be there for these patients because it is a life and death struggle. It aint some stubbed toe bs.I have been on one call where the gentleman was having severe withdrawl and said he knew the symptoms would go away if he used. He asked us to not put an IV in and to take him to the hospital so he couldnt get high. He was trying to quit. The fact is we respected the hell out of him for it. And we gladly will help someone like that. Honestly we would prefer going to that than going to revive you or explain to your family that you are not going to wake up. If you dont want to burden emergency services just drive yourself to the hospital and explain to them the situation.A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/opiates) if you have any questions or concerns.*Thanks fam. Hope all is well with u tooWhat the fuck? He sounds like a sweet guy, sounds like you’re a shitbag.I can’t even imagine. I know I wouldn’t be able to handle it.Lucky he didn't plant stuff on youGo play Fortnite and suck on your Juul.  Addiction to tobacco is no different, it just kills you a lot slower.  Hypocritical asshat.CuntnuggetAmen brother.  You'd think we could learn a lesson after what happened with alcohol prohibition.  Spoiler alert; it created poisonous booze, helped the mob thrive etc.  Prohibition will never work!that's a fantastic idea!!I posted about a week ago where two people kicked my ass in a very public place and the cops did nothing about it... I just realized why they didn't help me. I could get them fired from what I have been told by their supervisor but fuck I might as well let that go. Next time people with guns are messing with me they won't have an excuse to let me get shot �I was **in** the hospital bed. He came to me while I was delirious. Then throws the papers on my bed.How the fuck is it no different? I’m not shoving needles into my arm and can actually quit if I want to which I diddropped off a gift card to a coffee shop they frequent! talked for a little bit! he was really appreciative of it!! thanks!What a piece of shitWell first of all, not all of us use needles dude.  Both are addictions, and both can kill you.  Also, opiate addicts can and do also quit all the time.  Lots of recovering addicts.  Wonder how many people die from tobacco a year.  Well I looked it up:  "According to the Centers for Disease Control, 443,000 people die from diseases related to smoking each year. Smoking deaths are one of the most preventable causes of premature death."  That's a lot more than opiates kill.  Also, medical professionals are treating these people.  One could easily argue tobacco users, whether its vaping or whatever, are a much bigger drain on our society.  Just because sticking a needle in your arm is nasty doesn't make you any better.  Telling addicts to just not overdose just shows how much you don't care about people going through addiction problems.  You're not any better and you should maybe think about not judging and realize you've done an addictive substance that is far more deadly.  It's just not as taboo.  Have a good one dude.Also, how did you end up on the heroin and opiate subreddits?!  Hmmm  are you just here to bash people or what the fuck?  LolLol I looked and you just quit a month ago.  You commented 17 days ayo about it.  You don't seem to be insensitive to tobacco addicts though.  It's just not cool man.  They're human beings tooCant read your other comment except on your profile.  Maybe got shadowbanned.  This is r/opiates btw not r/heroin dude.  I'm a pain patient because I have a horrible congenital defect in my spine. You may not have done horrible shit.  That's not the point I made.  My point is they're both extremely destructive.  They're both extremely addictive.  They just kill you in different ways.  Tobacco is an even bigger strain than our health care system than any opiate.  They're completely the same in all those aspects and worse in some.  Overall tobacco is more harmful to society in terms of deaths and strain on our healthcare system.  That's just the facts.  I'm glad you don't steal and shit.  But you have consumed and been addicted to a substance that does more damage than opiates.  My norco prescription is why I'm on here.  I'm not a heroin addict. 

Your lack of compassion for people that are addicted to opiates is very offensive to me.  This sub is a huge harm reduction sub.  You think it's glorifying opiates and some people do.  This sub isn't the defining factor in people who use opioids like me.  I dont glorify it.  I'm not here for negative reasons.  I have compassion for addicts.  I don't think they're any less human, and definitely don't think they deserve to overdose like you do.  Your ignorance and insensitivity are truly appalling.  I'd never wish ill on you or anyone because I hate what drug addicts do.  I'm not justifying stealing or glorifying opiates.  I've seen many posts and comments of people warning other users they're on a slippery slope and they need to seek recovery.  If this sub helps save a few lives in any way it's a great thing.  If you want to think otherwise that's your choice.  I'm just hoping you get where I'm coming from.  I wish you a happy life, take care man.Doesn’t seem like anyone on here cares either. I’m pissed cuz people are on here glorifying, romanticizing and posting pics of their stash. It’s so different, I didn’t ruin my life and steal and cheat after ripping my juul. I didn’t hunch over in the middle of the road and walk around like a zombie after ripping my juul. Nah fuck that you can’t compare the two at allThe people who get clean and talk about how all addicts should just overdose are the worst type of people.    It seems like whenever these types relapse they usually OD.   Probably because they often have the "go big or go home"  mentality.I’m sorry to hear that and I think that is a complete different story than other people that just choose to escalate their drug choices where it gets to the point of opiates. And no I saw a picture of some dude flaunting like 5 grams of fentanylHahaha bro you’re a retard. You should do us all a favour and overdose yourself.

Fuck off this sub and never come back, wanker.Fuck you, you stupid cuntYou're right the two aren't comparable.   You can walk into the store and purchase nicotine in a multitude of delivery mechanisms,  the quality and strength are consistent with each product. 

Opiates are less physically damaging than nicotine as long as ROA is safe.  Psychologically the difference could vary. 

So what criteria was used to make certain psychoactives legal? 

There are lot of people who use that hold down full time jobs.  A lot more than you probably think.   Thinking that every opiate user is a walking zombie and immediately visable really really contributes to making it difficult to seek help.  When people say absurd things which are often taken as truth in pop culture it really is a testament to their ignorance.Nope, they just recently banned dope porn pictures.>romanticizing

i think if any sub romanticizes an addiction, it'd probably be the vaping/smoking communities on here. saying that as someone who used to smoke and still vapes. this community is riddled with horror stories of death and addiction. nobody really thinks addiction or death is cool, even the people here. besides, stash pics are banned here.Why are you actively commenting in an opiates subreddit then? Get the fuck out normieI appreciate the kind words.  Yeah, I don't think that shits cool at all.  Fentanyl is a fucking plague.  It's killing so many people and making my life harder.  The opioid epidemic has made legitimate pain patients like myself feel like criminals.  A lot of people have a hard time finding doctors that will prescribe pain meds.  Doctors are under a ton of pressure and it's making my life and lots of others way more difficult than it used to be.  I have to get my meds 1 month at a time now, refills at 30 days and take a drug test every month.  That's $200 since I dont have insurance.  It's a pain in the ass and I got enough pain already!  But I'm not the only one out there.  Some people start like me and end up on heroin.  I'll never touch the stuff, never have never will.  But I do understand frustration with some addicts.  It affects me directly.  Just please know there's guys like me (I'm only 30 too) who are on opiates.  And some even buy what they think are legit pain pills off the street, but they're pressed with fentanyl.  Then they overdose.  I'm lucky enough to have a great doctor and an otherwise healthy body besides my spine.  But some people overdose because they buy off the street, not being able to find a pain doc.  It happens.  Take care and have a good rest of the weekendI don’t take any truth from “pop culture” I drive down the road and see a zombie on every corner. I live by a road called the methadone mile so idk wtf you’re talking aboutI'm sorry to hear that.   Its bullshit that they took lifesaving pain medication away because of this whole paradigm shift in the opiate market. 

At this point I don't know why the US is engaged is drug warfare.   After all drug prohibition introduced fentanyl into the diamorphine black market and displaced the golden opiate with synthetics.   The supply chain was already in place and the amount of money that is going who knows where because of fentanyl is amazing. 

So let just stop this and let me go to the safety of a shop to buy any chemical I desire.  It won't be long before molecular printing or some type of implant or visual interface that is able to duplicate the effects of drugs. 

Every law based on morals has been overturned.   Why are we grasping so strongly to drug prohibition which absolutely is unconstitutional.   Cui bono?What are you doing here if you hate addicts? Like, what do you gain from this? Just the snide satisfaction of "sticking it to junkies"?

I'm going to explain something to you. Opiate addiction rates are through the roof right now. I read one estimate that said "there's an average of 1 addict per household", that seems a bit high but you get the point.

The junkies you see on the street robbing each other for morsels are just the tip of the iceberg. ***A lot*** of people are on opiods for one reason or another, it's just that the only people you know are on drugs are the ones that are mentally ill too.

Most are functioning addicts, you'll find a fair few here with jobs, families, ect. 

I'm not saying any of this makes it right, or wrong really. I'm just saying, maybe don't come in here with some caricature of what you think an addict is, with no personal experience, and hold that against random people online. That's more your problem than any of ours. 

You have no idea what you are talking about.I completely agree.  People will always experiment with drugs.  Prohibition only creates a black market and empowers criminals.  It does nothing to curb people's drug use.  Drug companies oversaturated the market with oxycontin and people finally woke up and realized what was happening and we had this huge backlash.  Things should just have gone to how they were before.  They shouldn't have created new restrictions that harm people.  The damage was done.  They created a sink hole of addicts that turned to illicit drugs like heroin.  If people could just go and get their desired substance from a regulated marketplace everything would be fine.  We do it with things like methadone so I dont see what people think is going to happen.  Everyone isn't all of a sudden going to be come drug addicted zombies.  It will have a positive effect.  It will take the money out of the hands of cartels.  Legalization of marijuana has more than shown what kind of amazingly positive impacts will come about.  Like you pointed out, they've created a fentanyl epidemic that us making, what I consider murderers, millions if not billions of dollars.  I feel like a criminal every mo th when I pick up my norco prescription for my legitimate pain.  And I'm a lucky one that has a good doctor who isn't scared as well as a good pharmacy who knows me well.  They are a smaller pharmacy though because I hear horror stories of places like walgreens and CVS that refuse to fill doctors scripts.  I'm glad people like you can see the future and understand the present on these drug issues.  Drug prohibition will never and has never worked.  We actually did treat drug addicts as a health problem before a lot of these drug laws.  Just legalize everything and regulate it so we can all be safe.  We have no problem letting people kill themselves with alcohol and tobacco.  If people want to do that, that's their choice.  It's no one else's business what I put into my body in the privacy of my home.  Take care friendRead my past comments. Half of my family are addicts of some kind @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Lmao, Content: , ups: 557, downs: 0"You don't want to smoke crack on adderall"

Nah, i'm good!

A short time later...... "OH FUCK I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK" don't mix your uppers and uppers girls and boys!This is literally me all the time. �Me: “If you take those bars, do NOT drink alcohol”

Friend: “bullshit what do you think you know everything? I got this!”

2 hours later passes out completely and starts to vomit uncontrollably.

Man I hate being the one of my friends that knows a lot about drugs. No one listens to you until they learn the hard way lmao
This is me. I've ALWAYS told my friends the more you know about drugs and how to do them safely, the longer you'll stay alive. �Straight scholar Literally me explaining half-lives. It's always the person on opiates who knows their shit.I always know what not to mix but mix anyway but I fucked up my tolerance to every class of drugs so it takes a lot of everything to fuck me up. Hopefully I jinxed myself and I'll run outta luck, I hate my life Hzhahaha omfg Its opioid! Not opiate! Fucking idiot! Jk. But fr people get like this alot. Ah the saddest thing is wasted talent. 
Aka me and everyone who upvoted this lol. 

I can probably explain the neurochemical reaction to most rec and psyc drugs, why/how they may damage the brain, long/short time side effects, half lives, addiction potential, what receptor subtypes they work on and by how much if they work on multiple ones. Alongside if they're agonists, antagonists, reuptake inhibitors etc. Best route of administration (bioavailability), effects on other parts of the body & so much more. 

Fuck - That's not talent I'm coming to realize as I approach my mid 20s lol ��. 
The amount of upvotes on this post now just confirmed that for me even moreso hah. �‍♂️ �

My parents way of keeping some hope in me for themselves & way of (trying to) instilling what little confidence I have left often say "oh you're very clever you know that? How you know about pharmaceuticals, drugs and the brain. You should become a dr. So much wasted talent" . This is coming from the parent who's a pharmacist. I'd often know more about drugs than her or other drs or pharmacists in my family at gatherings. I think that's just in regards to psychatric medication though. 
Speak about anything else or any other medication or human biological function and I'll be put into my place as the peasant I am. Lol.

At one point I was feeling high (in both ways hehe) & mighty with my parents bullshit comments about my so called intelligence not helping either like "ah you know what? I do have potential still/don't give up on yourself yet as you're "average" person at school doesn't know this sort of stuff. When you do! You're not dumb."

However as time passed, I slowly got older, watching my friends get  good jobs, married, travel, soon have kids & most importantly develop actual skills lol ... I'm  still here obsessed/addicted to certain drugs while at the same time trying to to get this monkey off my back (kicked opiates after a 2 year daily iv habit. 
Tbh though still use once every couple months or so. 
But compared to what I'm dependent on now aka benzos I wish I could have my opiate addiction back and never started benzos as a socially acceptable replacement to iv opiates as I feel they've taken a part of me from me.

Not that opiates didn't do that but at least with them you'd  be back to your normal self, or for the  most part in about 10 days.
Where with benzo dependency it can take months. So I'm told. I'm a few weeks in to the almost last of my benzo taper & it's bloody hard along with scary what damage they've done to my brain/cognitive skills, social skills & personality.  

Ah clearly I wasn't Mr know it all about drugs.
If I was, I would have stuck to what I'd preach to myself in my mind and others who'd ask me about drugs aka "oh just stick to weed & you'll be fine.". 
That or at least stuck to opiates and just quit those instead of using benzos as a socially acceptable & quick/cheap/practical way to deal with my anxiety or cravings.
So truI literally went to college to be that guy. I am that guy, and people know it. When I let my friends watch me do a CWE on some hydros one time they were deadass like kids watching a chemistry demonstration in school.I knew all the rules and what shouldn’t be mixed yet I’d shoot fent dope and eat 6-12mg of Xanax daily. Knowledge does not equal recovery or being safe yourself. Lol  Coke & boomers, bad mix....Lololol [deleted]That’s how I feel just telling them what pills they can and can’t snort lololDont get it[deleted]I've mixed uppers so much. Speedballs were also my thing, have yet to see a cardiologist and my heart pain is so bad ): I go to the ER and they always tells me nothing wrong. So I guess it's normal to get 10/10 heart pains so bad that you literally have to call an ambulance. My hearts fucked and it's from triple cs, uppers, and mixing Hell, even when they do learn the hard way and still don't listen, sometimes i just wonder how some people can still be alive. I feel obligated to say "username checks out" :)I swear this is true for some reason. I will never understand it, but it’s hella true.Probably because they are the most-fucked and understand why lmaoCWE? Only if you change your username to CaptainWeOD are you asking seriously orHe’s saying he feels smart explaining drugs and their effects to his friends Yeah it's only killed a bunch of people - no biggie.okay retard lmaoThis nigga gon die ☠get to that cardiologist asap, holy smokesdamn dawg. can I ask why you took triple c's instead of something with just dxm?No kidding I have a friend I just gave up on when It came to being safe. I’d watch the kid almost kill himself and magically come alive so many times.   gave the kid narcan a dozen times or so.. it’s fucked. Some People don’t care about being safe lmaoA lot of times they just die. It's happened too many times in my life.My first username checks out. I dig it, man. thanks �Cold water extraction, taking all the acetaminophen out of the pills[deleted]Except in my case, I often find my friends don’t really care. I need more friends who do drugs I got that, no idea who the character is, nor how it relatesI'm only 18 if that helps, but then again I had pre existing heart conditions befkre all the drugs They are 30mg and more convenient. Some people even prefer them. I prefer a drug called Ketamine, but y’all probably think it’s not cool like DXM :(Not only do I love they're 30mg, but I love the antihistamine, it synergizes and makes for a more intense experince and it's very easy to feel like you're dying on them which is my favorite feeling. I love them but I can't do them any more due to health problems. I always say that tho and get yo binging again but I'm few weeks clean today. Pushing for that month at a very small dose, yes. others may tell you otherwise out of fear, but I work in anesthesiology. doctors prescribe benzos and opioids regularly. do NOT overdo it. I mean generally I’ll only give out this info if it’s relevant. So if a buddy tells me he’s going to do acid this weekend and wants some tips, I’ll happily share some, but I won’t just start talking about safe consumption of LSD out of the blue lolThat’s from an episode of spongebob where he enters everybody’s dreams. That’s his pet snail Gary’s dream. He dreams about reading in a library pre existing heart condition and a speedball killed my boyfriend.  please please be safebe careful man, definitely get that checked out. And stop those combos. Had a friend who had to have heart surgery bc of stuff like this.

It would fuck them up for life think about it.It's a struggle sorry to hear, are you sober now? have you seen a cardiologist?  no need to answer if too personal of course �early 20sah I see ha I already feel fucked up for life and it's very obvious the damage I've done. Everytime I dose now I just kinda hope it kills me. I'm tappin out man, this life shit ain't for me Well have only been sober for 1 day now, but told my dealer to cut me off so I should be ok.

Lol) say the city??I mean, it says the city name in the image.  This rule is seemingly unavoidable sometimes, especially if there is a company or initiative with the city name in the title, a phone number with a local area code, etc.  Is there any chance of that rule changing?From the sidebar: 

>No location-specific posts! This includes neighborhoods AND cities. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources.Hrm, I guess photo-wise, that ruling would be pretty subjective. I don't think it would really lead to sourcing though. The focus is more on comedy than using drugs in said city. However, whenever cities get mentioned in texts posts or comments, people end up going too far with it (like pming users about it). 

Personally, I really doubt there is any chance of that rule changing at all, given the current state of things on reddit and the seeming push to ban things that make reddit look bad. If you would like to make a post about it or message the mod team for a more veteran mod to give their opinion on it, feel free to!

And it takes two careless people to accidentally create one, don't forget that part!You sound sexist and like you don’t know what you’re talking about. Being an addict doesn’t automatically equal bad parent. It’s common to get knocked up in early recovery because opiates can suppress your cycle/ovulation and girls are unprepared for the return of their fertility. Regardless, there are functional addicts who are able to love and care for their children, don’t judge another unless you’ve walked in their shoes.Lol but your comment wasn't edited? God damn if that ain't true!

Fucking love a girl with a choker.Ever fought the baby itself? Lil fuckers are a lot quicker than you'd think, and don't be lulled into a false sense of security if Baby doesn't have teeth in yet. Getting a calf full of rock hard gum hurts like the dickens, even through Jncos!Not a lot of gold gifted around /r/opiates. Wonder whyDoes anyone want to buy a gold?Except you have kratom. What can I say man just speaking from the heart. True storyThe other salient point is when it comes to quitting something it's much easier if it isn't embedded in your  social life. I probably dodged a bullet there.And couldn't afford the abortion [deleted]On the right Girl, it’s fucking hot and I’m definitely a sucker for it lol. But like all things, like tattoos even, they can be trashy. "Even thru Jncos," killed me. �because were junkies and we dont have money for gold. that would be lost heroin tokens!!Scrounging around for nickels to buy a cheap pack of cigarettes.Have we dated? Haha jokesHard pressed? I personally know several! Do you have children? Are you personally familiar with how the system works? Unless you can answer yes to both those questions, I suggest you move on. (Oh and nothing I said was sexist, unlike your atrocious comment).Word. Well done tattoo? Hell yeah. 

$15 heart tattoo that looks like my dog drew it? Hard pass. That and "hurts like the dickens" this thread is absolute comedic gold for me today.How do you know if you got gold on the alien blue app? They gave two years of free gold at one point, but idk how to check it or karma or whatever. 

I hate the Reddit app, so I still use alien blue. "Cigarettes"There was a dude that lived with us (me, my older sister, brother in law and their kids) who was on pills and a super heavy drinker (this was back when I was starting down my opiate addiction, had only been addicted to them for a few years at this point) who had a tattoo gun and would do super cheap tattoos, basically only word tattoos with several different kinds of font or calligraphy or the most simple of designs that would be fairly small and incredibly not well done.  This one chick who was acquainted with my older sister and would come by fairly frequently decided to get a like heart of some sort with her husband's name in the middle.  He charged her like $40 or $50 and as one would imagine it was incredibly not nice looking.  She was furious and the next day came by looking for him and wanted it fixed. My input to her was along the lines of, "What exactly did you expect for paying an incredibly small amount from someone who isnt a professional and having it done in our bathroom."


She was not amused and had seriously told me she expected better and that was a lot of money for a tattoo.  I showed her my one tattoo I had at the time and asked her what she thought I paid for it and I forget what she guessed but she was so amazingly far off thinking it was a hell of a lot cheaper than it was (it was professionally done by a friend of mine who is a tattoo artist)  pay shitty prices get shitty work.  I don't get why so many people dont understand that.I'd take a tattoo your dog drew. He's just doing his best to be a good boyi am not really sure to be honest. i dont use that app:/I just paid 300 bucks for a tattoo, and I thought that was pretty cheap lmao. People need to do their research before they get something that lasts forever.God I remember "tattoo parties" back in the day lol. The guy in your story reminds me of the tattoo party guy from my hometown. 

I think most people don't realize how much good work costs. $6,000+ for a full horror film themed sleeve is a bargain when the work is impeccable. And at least $100 tip after every session is the norm. He's 11 and only does paw prints. He's become stubborn in his old age lol. No worriesBack in'98, I turned 18 and wanted my first tattoo. I picked a design to be inked onto the top of my foot. I went to an actual place.

Anyway, the artist began to caution me against putting a first tattoo on a painful and high friction area. We're sitting back in her workspace discussing it when the receptionist out front overhears the conversation and comes back.

So, the receptionist says, "... you know where a *CLASSY* and *unique* place is that I've seen some women put a tattoo?" , she asked?

"Where's that?" I replied...
She said, " on the small of the back,".�

I go ahead and agree. Total 90s shit, too. A flower, ladybug, some Chinese lettering bullshit. About ten years later, I'm listening to the radio, and what do ya know? They were talking about TRAMP STAMPS.

But...but...that bitch said it was classy!!��

Separate but related...
A friend of mine who I was lucky enough to be cellmates with last time I was in county had the best tattoo. A barbed wire cross tattooed on her titty.Pffft.  I probably paid 30 ramen soups in total for my tattoos.  All professionally done.Hahaa ughLmao can you imagine just having a scribble and a paw print next to it and be like (I let my friends dog do an original. T-thats the signature)I got my first (and only so far) down the side of my ribs. A fox outline with mountains and trees in it. Hurt like a bitch. I can't imagine having one on my foot though. I think the artist was right to warn you... oof.

Gotta say though, a barbed-wire titty is pretty amazing. Would totally get that if I were a woman. 

Oh, and hey, doesn't matter if it's classy as long as it looks good :DI know a chick with an assault rifle tattooed across her chest. Also has serious dreads.

This area has a bad rep. I think they had a kid in the car. 

Edit: yea they did. Someone linked the article. Shits so sad.  Always hated seeing people use around kids.  Most ashamed I’ve ever been is hanging out with these two people and the dboy’s girl while he copped for us.  They had custody of their grandchildren. The two kids were 5 and 12.  While I waited(of course it was like 3 hours) we all sat in this room(with no door knob/didn’t close, hella dirty) they were just smoking clear and black like it was no one’s business.  I said something to my plugs chick about them just using openly in front of the kids and she was just like oh it’s no big deal, they don’t know what’s going on.  I was so upset over it.  Can’t stand people straight using in front of kids.  Yet, still I stayed and waited for my b.  That’s addiction for you, finding yourself justifying things the normal you abhors.  They were some people that I wouldn’t mind getting locked up.  I will say I never went through that guy again.   


Edit:  funny meme though �Posting on an alt account. This picture reminds me of the time I basically saved this dude's life. The following story takes place over the course of roughly 15 minutes and is 100% true to the best of my memory.  He was an aquantaince. Not a super close friend, but we had been hanging out and he had gotten some street ready heroin/gunpowder/whatever y'all call it. It was not laced with fent, I know that for sure. 

We were sitting in my driveway and he was making a shot. I guess he had been getting bunk shit because this stuff knocked him on his ass. He finished his shot, and then nodded off after a few minutes. I wanted to tell him that I was gonna go inside and that I'd call him later, but he became unresponsive quickly. This was no ordinary, everyday nod... This was advance nodding. 

I tried calling his name loudly, but he didn't notice. He began to drool, and then his lips started turning a very faint shade of blue. I knew I had to act immediately. With no way to easily get him out of the driver's seat (I also had neighbors outside), I reached my leg over to the brake pedal, shifted the car into reverse, and proceeded to drive his car from the passenger seat down my block and around the corner. I quickly grabbed all his paraphernalia, spoon, rigs, and baggie and called 911.

I managed to drive the car reasonably well, but when I parked it I had hit the curb. Not hard, the tire was just pressed up against it.

 I told the EMS hotline person that I was coming home and I saw a car that looked like the driver had hit the curb. That I went to talk to the driver, but he was unresponsive, and mentioned his other symptoms. They asked me if I could wait by the car, but I told them I had already left the scene to come home and use my landline phone. But I told them exactly where the car was and what it looked like. 

About 30 seconds after hanging up I heard fire truck sirens. I ran back to my house, and I'm not quite sure why but I got in my car and left. No way I was sticking around, though I doubt it would have mattered if I just stayed inside. By the time i reached the bottom of my street to take a right, the firetruck and ambulance were already there. There might have been a police car, but I don't remember. 

I was gone for about an hour, and when I came back the car was gone. Later that day my friend called me and told me about what happened. He said that they gave him narcan, and since he had no paraphernalia whatsoever in the car, the EMS guys asked him if someone could come pick him up, and pick the car up. 

He had his sister and his cousin come. The car wasn't towed. He didn't die from his overdose, or get in any trouble with drug possession charges. His sister took him home safely along with his car, and that was it - literally nothing bad happened. I'm just glad I was there .. there's no doubt in my mind what would have happened if I didn't act fast in that moment. This is so brutal. I legit cannot decide how to feel about it haha. Well done. ���best one Now that's what I call happy nodsGod damn[deleted]Did they die ?The grand ma and great uncle ?

Husband looks like he was tired from a long day and took a nap and i would have not been suspicious if i walked by and he was the only one.This picture is kinda disturbing. At first I thought they were mannequins, like if you've ever heard of someone putting a mannequin in their passenger seat to drive in the H.O.V. or carpool lane.. their skin looks so clammy, pallid and pale. man, they are complete scum. think about your fucking child. could you even imagine what it would be like to watch both of your parents o.d. in front of you. at that kids age that will do some pretty good damage probably.holy christhard nodsLol reminds me of someone's Twitter handle: donotnarcanAt least he had his seat belt on...safety first obviously..except they forgot the one person do a shot at a time so one can narcan the other...rip the parents and the childs mental health(will probably be an addict as well sadly)Was there a child in the car?OOFYeah let's poke fun at bullshit junkies do to their kids. Well done Fell sorry for the kidYeah this was on the news there was a child in the backseat in a car seat I will post the link once I find ithttps://heavy.com/news/2016/09/parents-overdose-heroin-in-car-with-son-ohio-graphic-photos-rhonda-pasek-james-lee-acord-child-engangerment/

Just googled parents overdosed with baby in car,  it’s pretty sad tbh 

Photoshop game is on point in OP though Fent?The whole god damn river valley is fucked sadly. It's been years now but I used to go to Stubenville to cop. I am 2 years sober at the moment but shit man, the peoples I knew out there are not as lucky as I am and are no longer with us. RIP.

&#x200B;You from the Yo?Do you not have a Good Samaritan law where you are?  In Canada and many states you cannot be charged with possession, etc. & nor can anyone else involved (in this case your friend) if you’re reporting an overdose.  In Canada this drastically changed things and we no longer need to drag a friend to the corner to get help and then call 911 and run away.  Instead you can start performing CPR or administer narcan while you wait for first responders.  I once even had the paramedics give me time to hide (larger than possession amount) drugs before they let the cops onto the scene.  

Also, if they don’t have a Good Samaritan law, do you have access to narcan?

Edit: now that I think about it, the car definitely changes things.  I’m not sure to what degree though.As of right now, at least 9 people have upvoted this comment. That makes me think 9 people are depressed and wanna die. I always ‘joke’ about how this is how I want to die. Happy nodding out. Maybe it’s just me. 

Ps. I’m not really suicidal. Life just really sucks at the moment and suicidal ideation is a real thing. 

Edit: a letter & dude, bot bro, I’m good. :)In the original meme, there’s a dog in a car instead of two people nodded offWhy the downvotes? Seems like he just didn’t understand the joke.No, they were narcanned and spent some time incarcerated.  They might still be there, not sure.Throw me an upvote now that you know it was their grandchild.Yeah that whole thing must have been traumatizing for the kid. Couldn't imagine >I felt out sorry for the kid.

 FTFY"The poison known as heroin..." I'm sure the writer meant shitty dealers that cut their H heavy with cheap fent and don't tell their customers what they're really getting.Prolly fentBingoHoly typos in that articleThis is so incredibly sad..FUCK. Now I can't even joy this at all.  But thanks for the real life check.Yep.  Google "East Liverpool" "heroin" and you'll see how bad it is there.  Sad shit, man.  If I remember correctly, the adults were actually the kiddo's grandparents.  Which makes me wonder where the parent(s) were... That poor kid.Congrats on your sobriety I have two years also.  I’m proud of you, I know it isn’t an easy road.  Keep fighting the good fight No but close by. Im in the yo on a daily basis though. Happy nods doesn’t sound very suicidal to me sounds more like a good time lolHelperdroid and its creator love you, here's some people that can help:

 [source](https://gitlab.com/0xnaka/thehelperdroid/) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=cancerous_176)They ain't noddin, they ded �This can be used on alot of reddit posts. Oh and by the way Username checks out , good job snagging that one lol . That’s a score ��Article says that it was the boys grandmother and great uncle. Great uncle did just under a year and the grandma did 180 days. The grandma had just won custody of the child 4 weeks prior. The mother of the child lost custody 4 months before giving birth due to drugs but not heroin and is now a stripper in northern Ohio. 

I think it’s incredibly stupid how the cops just plastered all their faces all over. The same message would’ve been loud and clear with blurred faces. Also, incarceration isn’t going to fix addictions you fucking slow pigs. 

Edit: this happened in 2016 so, yes, they are out now. At least for those charges. Not sure about probation or anything along those lines. I guess at least he was young young and probably thought mum and sad where sleeping... what’s the chance kid will go down same path ?I’d go as far to say that heroin had a stigma before it was even cut with fent heavily, and for good reason lolGod why can't people wait til they get home. Esp with a kid in the car. The same exact thing happened to someone I know and both parents are now in jail. Hopefully their daughter doesn't end up remembering this because when the police showed up she had opened the door and was screaming at her mother who is very fortunate to even be alive. Granted if they were home alone they might not have ever been found but still that poor little girl watched her mother die. Where's that fucking paperclip when you need him?I kinda feel like they should blanked faces ? I mean they could of easily been placed on opiates painkillers then progressed on to h ?

 This attaches a stigma to all substance abusers , I guess it’s coz kid was in car ?
 But you can imagine the uproar non drug user from middle class felt ... behind every addiction there’s a story and a lost soul ..IDK what the yo is, but +1 for username. I used to spend a lot of days there too.  Happy nods isn’t the part that makes it suicidal. Saying happy nods to a picture of two people that look like they may have overdosed is more what I was referring to. Why would the great uncle, who I’m guessing was not the guardian of the kids, do more time than the grandmother who likely had custody? I’m probably missing something?Yes, and there was a brief discussion on the national stage about that very issue when that picture went viral.  The PD stood their ground and doubled down on their stupid, if I recall correctly, and said it was necessary to show the faces because awareness.  What a crock of shit.Now that he has to grow up with out parents probably a pretty high chance. I mean best case scenario he had someone in his family adopt him and maybe that helps in the long run, but worst case is he's thrown into the foster system. Most of those kids don't have a chance, although some do Even if the daughter doesn't remember visually what happened, it is definitely ingrained in her memory now. You don't ever forget or lose that level of fear and panic and as you get older those feelings turn into anger and abandonment issues :/ kids are literally like sponges. I hope that little girl that you know turns out alright. Lol mr clippy where are you That's the podunk East Liverpool Police Department for you.  Same PD that contacted the media to sensationalize a traffic stop where the officer got a little bit of fent under his glove and claimed overdose.  Education and law enforcement seldom go hand-in-hand when there's an agenda, sadly.  Dont do it, dont do it, dont do ist... ;)Ahh you are right haha I’m not really sure. He was charged with child endangerment and whatever they call a DUI. He had 2 prior DUIs though from what I can tell, 1 for sure. 

She had 3 charges... child endangerment, public intoxication, and I can’t remember the third. She had 1 prior of possession. 

Edit: I’m guessing because of the priors.The time was undoubtedly for the DUI. That's the one crime they can basically do whatever they want with. They have a huge window of penalities and the judge can basically do whatever the fuck he wants.

I doubt the child-related charges were even significant, though obviously the judge used it as criteria to lengthen other sentences for the additional crimes.Well, I'm just guessing but sometimes men seem to get longer sentences then women. It's also possible that since the uncle was in the driver's seat., he got hit with a DUI as well, especially since there was a child in the car apparently. As others have said, he had previous DUI's, and when you start stacking them they really throw the book at you.Yeah, I did what you said and googled “Liverpool heroin” and read the NPR article. Showed the three idiots who decided to post the pic. They think that because they’re posting everyone with a drug charge on Facebook that that is the reason for the drug problem going away. Yet in the same article it clearly shows it’s doing absolutely nothing. They’re just shaming people which, hello, isn’t helping an addict brain in the slightest. The pic they had of the 3 guys was just them looking so smug. NPR did a great job making them look quite dumb later in the article. Can you imagine? Last night my daughter asked how my dad died so I told her about brain tumors and then she became quite insecure about my mortality. Children are obviously very vulnerable for a long time and they know this instinctively. It's incredibly easy to inadvertently make mistakes and damage them. Yeah that police department is scummy af. They claimed that they needed to educate the public and that this was the final straw that pushed them to do so, however, when they published it faces and all it wasn’t to educate the people about fentanyl but specifically the “non-using public” so that they could bear witness to what they now “have to put up with every day”.But but THE PATRIARCHYYes, I loved that article.  NPR typically does a great job of shining the spotlight on stupid.   @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Moving on up!, Content: , ups: 557, downs: 0Congrats!Way to go man. Hell yeah! Congrats dude.

Congratulations!!Good job dude!Congratulations! ☺️Damn your coin is way more fancier them my three month coin[deleted]Congrats man!! That’s pretty  cool, all my meetings have are those cheap plastic keychains �Itanimulli demrifnoc\*CongratsYou’re doing amazing sweetie! (Don’t read it in that Kardashian meme way ��). But seriously you’re doing great, keep it up!!  I’m so proud of you! ��Props brother! I remember that chip fondly. Keep doing what you’re doing, dude. Do the masons have NA? That coin looks like something you'd get from the Masons.Congratulations, buddy!! Keep it upThats fucking inspiration man...you pretty much feel completely normal? Or dovyou have bouts with depression/anxiety?Congrats that’s a huge accomplishment !Aw fuck that lol unless I can walk in and they believe I haven’t drank for 3 years and gimme a medal then AA can lick my ass lol. Never found them helpful for me to quit drinking. 
But for you they have helped immensely so congrats my dude! Quitters never win!Thanks!Appreciate itIndeed. I’m not going to pretend it’s easy, but it’s getting easier. AAAA bro lolThanks budThanks bro!Thanks Thank you!��I wish you luck when you try again!Didn’t know that existed! I’ll check it out. Some of the groups around here give these brass ones instead of the plasticy aluminum ones. Not IMEDo I know you? � You’re so nice thanks!It’s actually AA. They are much stronger in the area that I’m in. Plus I have problems with alcohol too. Do you see how it says “to thine own self be true” on the coin? You could pick up a three year medallion drunk, no one in the room has to believe you. You could get any chip no problem.Yessir , I hope you keep moving forward so you can be an inspiration and motivation to us when we decide to make the brave choice you did , thank you We get plastic chips lmao i camt do aa makes me want to drink, an ive tried lots of meetings to many pushy people that want to jump in your life. Like nahh i dont need 5 different ppl calling me multiple times a day to see how im doing. Shit annoys me and triggers me.We’ve commented on each other’s stuff before :))Oh ok, but is it with the Masons?[deleted]Haha ok! Thanks again ☺️Have you ever heard of [SMART meetings](https://www.smartrecovery.org/)? If not, it might be worth looking into. They're not as numerous as NA/AA but I prefer their approach. It doesn't have a spiritual foundation but is instead based on scientific research, especially cognitive behavioral therapy.Sure am!Im sober off alcohol and opiates, which in my eyes is pretty sober. I do take kratom amd smoke weed. Those 2 things keep me sane, if i didnt have them id just keep relapsing on alcohol.I'll second this. I'm not much for any of those groups in general, but I've found SMART much more palatable than any AA/NA. Closest smart meeting to me is a good hour round trip not worth it for me or id try. I live in a area  where AA and NA is very prevalent. I honedtly wish i could find a meeting tht was smaller all the ones i go to have like a hundred people or more. I like more smaller groups that are more intimate. I get more out of them only place i found thise were in south florida. Also its hard for alot of the people there to understand my poly substance addiction. Plus i swear most of the people there arent even what i would consider alcoholic. When i drink i drink all day long for months at a time, i dont ever meet those ppl irl only on reddit. Can you please remove your location?

I thought it was Ambien.Fucking A good for him. This is how I know that unlimited funds and access would not make my addiction pleasant, when folks like this quit. Or kill themselves cause they can't quit. Opiate addiction steals your soul. We aren't meant to be numb, we aren't meant to feel that good all the time.Yes pain pills , also Valium and yes sleep medsThat man has unlimited drug money at all times. Any doctor would even write him any scripts he’d want for the right price. People in his life offer him drugs all the time. He’s one of the most famous rappers of all time.

If fucking HE can do it, so the fuck can you. 

One day at a time.Coincidentally it's been 11 years since he has released any good music.
But at least he's clean and he is still a brilliant rapper that released some great music.Y’all think he takes any narcotic meds that are RX’d to him like klonopin or something. Because I take adderall and Xanax and I’m also on methadone but I take my meds as prescribed so according to my old sponsor I’m clean.... it’s a fine line of what being clean actually is. I think he may take some low benzo because em’s always said he has had a problem with anxiety but I think he’s clean.Way to be Em!Gotta stay away from those blue & yellow purple pillsWhile in pharmacy school (1999), I learned a lot about prescription drugs from his songs!Found this:

https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0629/Marshall-Mathers-Prescription-drug-abuse-almost-killed-him-he-saysHe did alot of K-pins too11 years since his music has actually been good...Keep it up Slim ShShShShaaaaaaady!!!!I feel like this is a better interview. He talks in much more detail about his drug use and when he came so close to dying:


https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-on-the-road-back-from-hell-249093/If eminem can do it...i cantHow does one start doing vicodin and not switch to oxy? Only eminem knowsHe’s miserable, too now.Damn 11 years? Props I can’t go a day without feeling shitty or 11 hours without somethingDon't i fucking wish.He was better on drugsReminds me, I remember I was sitting in the car with an old friend about to slam.
He then proceeded to show me his 1 year sober chip he got in prison.What a fucking quitter! /s

Seriously tho good for him. Dude almost died in the hospital one timeProps to him. I have been a huge fan since he came onto the scene back in '96. His music has had it's up's and down's, but he is hands down a lyrical genius, and one of the best rappers that have ever lived. He does not get the prop's he deservesWhat was his main drug of choice?Been a little longer than that since he’s made anything worth listening too     NoGod is great. I’m wondering about his 12th step work and how it looks like considering he is a celebrity. I’m sure many people try to manipulate. 

I’m glad he is seeking god and trying to build his spiritualityWho caresI’m not sure, i just thought people would appreciate it!he had a major vicodin problem that he talks about in his songs - mostly valium and vicodin thoughHe had an everything addiction. “Vic’s perch and methadone pills” is a lyric in going through changes. Also sleeping pills and ValiumI thought it was primarily benzos....among other thingsI have his old CD I'm pretty sure it's a broken Vicodin on the disc itselfHe has a weird list of drugs he takes, it was ambien, and Lortabs, mushrooms, weed, and he’s said methadone before in song but I don’t think he was a heavy opiate user.

Edit- I take that back, he might have been a heavy opiate user idk, I’ve just never heard him talk about withdrawals like ever from opiates, you think that’s something he would rhyme about but I don’t think he ever said he at 30 30’s like dude up top said.Pretty sure he had a poly-substance abuse problem. He took a LOT of different drugs because he could. Most drug addicts have a hard time supporting their main drug of choice habit and if they got to add another drug once in a while it was a treat.Yes. He OD'ed on methadoneHe started eating Methadone pills as well, which is what he overdosed on.Heard at one point he was doing 30 30s a day he saidIt was Ambien, Valium, vicodin, and methadonehe Od'd on methadone onceHe did.  He was addicted to all sorts of different pills including Vicodin.  At some point he ended up OD'ing on Methadone, not sure how, but that was the catalyst that forced his life change.I thought he was on methadone for a whileTo be fair they can also afford the best support systems lolTrue that!FaxualBut he has never had to be a homeless junkie on the streets or doing gay4pay for his next shot. Or wanted treatment but been unable to afford it. Etc. 

Just cause X can do it doesn't mean Y can do it. Some people can, and some people can't because they don't really want it and can't commit or they can't cause they lack the resourcesHim being able to do it has absolutely nothing to do with another person. Our brains are all very different. So.. what you said is dumb.I have the exact same opinion. He was way better on drugs.Yeah thats why clean is a subjective term. To many you're not clean but you are in recovery. The words clean and sober often end up being harmful and exclusive to other approaches to recoverytbh you have or you are prone to have the same problems he had, its not like he went through a fent or etizolam addictioni doubt it. he's had problems with valium and prob other benzos in the pastFor real!That’s awesome!Interesting read!Brain dead like Jim BradyFeel dat!I definitely think he does get the props he deserves tbh. Especially with all the eminem stans there areHe’s doing it right, he doesn’t mention the program much hents the anonymous part of the program but he does have the recovery triangle necklaces he wears everyday.I know i care. Even if hes famous, and im not a super fan of his music hes still someone who got out.Vicodin, adderall, and ambien mainly“I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him”Doesn’t he have a Vicodin tattoo? Could be confusing him with someone else.I guess having unlimited money isn't always a good thing...That’s insaneSource pleaseHoly shit.I remember reading that it was 40-60 Valium a day he said he was taking. Which is a shit ton of benzos on top of Vicodin, ambien, and methadone which is what lead to his bad OD n almost died.At one point in my addiction I was doing 10 of em a day....I couldn’t even imagine building up a tolerance that would allow 30 per day.He NEVER took oxy unless it was a percocet or percodan tho so this is false. He OD'd cuz he went from taking vics to methadone all while being on high dosages of valium... He never took roxies, ever. He would have been much smarter to take roxies tho over the methadone but he obviously didnt know shit about the drugs he was taking and abusing and hence why he OD'd...Absolutely. If only we all had access to rehab and great doctors!When you learn and accept that life’s going to have absolutely terrible and extremely great days, you really learn to find peace within yourself and not get caught up in whatever moment you’re in.right but for him, there would be absolutely no downside to just staying on pills for the rest of his life. he could EASILY obtain them, and keep it a secret due to virtually endless supply and/or doctors that give him what he asks. 

i would argue that it’s actually much harder to continue staying sober in his situation, because there would be absolutely zero incentive dude.

think about it.

he doesn’t have to sacrifice ANYTHING for opiates, so giving them up would be so much harder than a junkie who has given up everything for them. the incentive comes purely from within him, with absolutely zero external pressure to stay sober.that's a similar excuse to saying 'I'm big boned/have bad genetics, so I can't lose weight'. Like, yeah, people do have different brain chemistries and it might make it much harder for one person to get clean compared to another, but pretty much anyone can do it if you have the will.You're a bit incorrect. Anybody can do it. Its just a matter of want/will to do itYup, i fucking hate when people say that. If that was the case, i would've been done quit. If i can do it, *anyone* can! Yeah, ok.ppl downvoting you have no idea what being addicted is about
also plz, there is no such thing as 'unlimited money for drugs' 

not to mention its a disrespect with people going through hell iv'ing fent, heroin, etizolam, smoking crack/iv'ing coke to be compared and judged because eminem who was addicted to fucking diazepam, ambien and fucking vicodin managed to stop

please stop thisI found an even better one here:

https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-on-the-road-back-from-hell-249093/I never heard adderall as something he did commonly. May be true tho. From his lyrics it seems like he did a ton of benzos on top of Vicodin and ambien.

I think he did an interview on ecstasy too.Uppers was not something Em did on the regular at all... It was vicodin, valium and ambien. Started with ambien and then got a hold of some vicodin and valium from people and doctors being stressed out and over worked from shows and tours... eventually he got addicted and was taking it daily. His main issue was valium tho as he took like 30-40 of them in a day sometimes. 

Then he OD'd cuz he was sold methadone instead of vicodin cuz he always complained the vics made his stomach hurt so the dude was like here these will be easier on ur liver and he took em and loved em and kept taking em not realizing that shit builds up in system and doesnt wear off completely like vics do after a couple hours... Honestly Em seems like a idiot and was just asking for an OD if u ask me. He didnt know shit about the drugs we was taking and even said he didnt have his first beer till after he was in his early 20's... The dude went from taking vicodin to methadone, all while taking massive amounts of benzos... stupid af... Like there are so many other opiates he could have taken instead that would have been way better for his liver/stomach and yet still stronger than the vics like roxies or percocet even ( I kno is has tylenol too but he would need a lot less compared to the vics to get fucked up) or hell even oxycontin or morphine tabs... No one goes from vics to methadone unless they are super drug naive. And he never talked about it with anyone cuz he always wanted to hide it so its not like anyone was telling him this shit even tho he must of had some shitty ass dealers tho... If I was supplying Em and he said the vics hurt his stomach, my first reaction would not be, oh well heres some methadone instead, like wtf? I would have told him to try some roxies or oxycontin instead... u know, the normal tolerance progression road most users take...esp knowing he was on such a high dose of valium as well... The OD could have easily been avoided... Then he said the doc told him "he had the equivalent of 4 bags of heroin in his system..." Like wtf, leave it to a doc to say some whack ass shit like that... no1, heroin ranges in potency so 4 bags could mean literally anything as u never kno the strength and no2, it wasnt the opiates that caused the OD alone, it was the fact that he had an insane amount of valium in his system and then all that methadone stacked on top... so the doc could have said he had 100 bags of dope in his system when he OD'd, it wouldnt change the fact that it was the combo of a long ass acting opiate and large dose of benzos that fucked him over. Tbh, I bet he would of had a much greater chance of NOT ODing if he had used 4 bags of dope instead of taking all that methadone... lolsickest line about vicodin ever.In most cases you're right but in this case his money could have saved his life. Imagine having that drug habit and not being rich. He could have been doing illegal shit to get it or he could have been doing heroin. Either one of those things could have very easily killed him or put him in prison as it does for a lot of people. A habit with pharmaceutical opiates is a lot safer and having all that money probably isn't what caused his addiction to begin with; it just made it so he could do safer drugs.This was probably back when 30s would be 5-10 bucks on the street. People only wanted 80s back then.I wish I could find it. I could of swore he mentioned doing this much during a tour with Dre. I forget which one. I know for a fact he often took Vicodin and Valium tho.People gotta remember, oxy 30s used to be the cheapest drug you could get. A lot of people had 1g/day habits. :/Shit, even people that do have access to all that don't make it. I have Medicaid and can go to a variety of detoxes and rehabs/long-term programs in addition to family that will help me any way they can without enabling me, and I'm still struggling like crazy to get clean. In and out of treatment like it's going out of style. I want to stop using but just fucking can't. People say i just don't want it badly enough. I just don't know wtf is wrong with me. Sorry for the rant and good for Marshall, I'm sure no matter how much money he has or what kind of support systems he has, it wasn't/isn't easy.why tf are so many more of them terrible :(I like that thoughtThis is deepHe didn’t even need to keep it a secret he was openly fucked on drugs and still making money putting out songs and doing gigs. He def could of just continued it if he wanted toI personally disagree  in some regard but I do agree with some of your points. I guess my ultimate conclusion is there is no tangible way to compare the true difficulty overall of his recovery versus another person's. It's not really measurable imo because there are so many factors and elements that tie into each individual person's experience with sobriety. 

I do understand why it is easier for him in his situation to end up struggling to get clean. But I guess what I mean is if you take Eminem - taking him hypothetically let's say he wants to commit and is ready. And you take another person who equally wants it but instead of eminem's money, treatment options, potential support system, Etc everything that does work in his favor... this person is homeless, stealing or doing like sex work to support their habit,  jobless and broke, lacking family and friends that haven't disowned them, no insurance or accessible treatment because of money.  Etc. Then person 2 is gonna have it worse. 

I guess it all boils down to wanting it or not. I do see all your points yeah it would be extremely hard for eminem to continue recovery long term. And I don't disagree with it being in some ways even harder. Really I suppose I was just looking at a flip side perspective. There's no right answer thoNo, it's like saying "food addiction is real and it's not as easy for one person to lose weight as for another". Which it is... coming from someone who lost 70lbLolLol you are so uneducated.Right... no one person is the same! One person can get through being abused as a kid... the next will be fucked up for life.... goes like that with any problem in life. Thats what mental illness is. The people who dont understand obviously didnt have depression BEFORE ever using.So his addiction and mental health issues are invalidated because he was addicted to pharma pills? Addiction is addiction. The dick measuring in this sub is ridiculous sometimes. I am a poly-sub addict, and I was addicted to pharma pills. My addiction was/is just as life altering and destroying as a heroin addicts, or a crack heads. I have also been addicted to crack, and meth at different points in my life, and addiction is addiction, regardless. To say that only IV users really know what it's like to suffer from addiction is bullshit. When your life is being ruled by a drug, the ROA of that drug is irrelevant.I’ve read somewhere that most of the Marshall Mathers LP Eminem was on ecstay doing 12 hour “creative binges” in the booth with DreI remember him saying he was taking a lot of ValiumHe has a lot about mdma in his less popular songs. I always figured that was his main thing.Yeah back in the good dayTrue. People would "settle" for 30s when the 80s and 120s were out of stock. The "doctor" would dispense 180 30s for $240Bruh I remember when 30s were cheap af. And THE REAL OC 80s!! Ohhhh the taste.Getting clean isn’t the hardest for me it’s staying clean, finding a reason to want to live feeling anxious and nervous fucking sucked. I hated the AA program and got to the core problems and treated my anxiety and depression and now I want to stay clean. Good luck bro I hope you find peace.where I live the relapse rate for people who go to rehabs is higher than 99%, Brazil

I've been forced to detox myself 11 times on terrible places and ofc I've never won any vice fight and I am okay with the fact that I will take methadone for life, its better than having to hustle for morphine or oxies, there are no opiate addicts over here except for me and 10 other people lmao (not even kidding), they have no clue on how to treat opiate addictionWhen he was using, he was literally the most popular artist on the planet.I agree with you. Once someone does shameful things like sex work, AND are homeless staying in hotels or with some weird old guy with no insurance or bullshit state health insurance its hard to get out of that kind of hole. The shame alone is deadly, then struggling trying to find help is overwhelming because there isn't really any...... but some people do have health conditions that make losing weight infinitely harder. Same thing with addiction, there are different conditions to each situation that can easily make one harder than the other. Congrats on the 70lbs seriously but just cause you lost that much weight doesn't mean someone that happens to have X health condition can just as easily lose the same weight.Oh please educate meHe's actually not uneducated. It is true that the will/desire is the ultimate factor necessary for successful long term recovery. What about that is it you are convinced is wrong ?Damn, apparently people really disagree with us. It's like my parents saying, your brother went to detox then rehab once and has four years now- why the fuck can't you do it? Oh, IDK, maybe i just love the miserable junkie lifestyle that much? I mean, i get it in terms of encouragement, but beyond that, it's pretty meaningless and even  condescending/demeaning on some level. If *I* can do it, you can too, wherein since i can and you can't, there must be something wrong with you or lacking- but that's just me being bitter and over-analyzing.I dont think anyone suggested that, no idea what are you even talking about lmao

you know whats beyond ridiculous? acting as if he went through hell, thats ridiculous

put yourself on his shoes because thats exactly what I did and then I realized I'd 'win' any fight vs a vicodin addiction

edit; its hilarious that you mentioned dick measuring because I havent even mentioned myself yet you did, projecting way too much? I never said that iv'ing was the only ROA that would make addicts suffer, where did you get this from? LMFAO

also I just realized the sub we are in but at first I thought we were somewhere else

also its hideous that you, yourself spinderella is saying that his addiction can be compared to the regular joe whos addicted to IV'ing fent or smoking crack, dont you realize this? seriously, I am not even kidding here

you used to be a more coherent and concise person, not sure whats going on anymoreso you decided to ignore how arrogant and stubborn you were and just downvoted me

way to go mod, lmfaoOr 180 20s for a $20 copay monthly in my caseFuckkk if onlyyyy it was still like that these days. I cant even imagine 120mg in 1 pill let alone 80mg in a pill lol now people are crazy over the 30s and packijg 30 mg into those is wild. Ahhhh oxy i lovr you but hate you so muchTHEY NEVER HAD 120mg OXYCONTIN IN THE US!!! I dont get why people cant understand this... The highest mg of oxycontin in the states was 80mg unless u consider the 2 year window when the 160mg blue oblong tablets were manufactured and sold in the US but that was only from 2000-02, way b4 the big oxycontin craze really took off so most users never even got to try one of those. The 120mg round purple/grey tabs u see people posting on here once in a while are only distributed in EU countries like Italy.. They arent available anywhere else. They never had the 160s anywhere but in the US and again, it was only from 2000-02. 

And if a doc is writing a legit script, why would a pharmacy be out of stock? U could just take the script to a different pharmacy and get it filled there... I agree that people only wanted roxies when OCs werent around and most wouldnt pay more than $5-7 for one but unless ur talking about dealers as "doctors" then ur statement makes no sense.Oh my God, this comment is so fucking true from top to bottom. That, “...finding a reason to want to live (while) feeling anxious and nervous fucking suck(s)”. This 110%. I’m so happy your anxiety and depression is under control!!! I’ve been abstinent from Heroin for about 5 1/2 months now and yet my anxiety is still horrible. My depression just drops by to say hello occasionally, I thank God it’s not horrible every day like it was in the past. May I ask what you’re doing now that has you feeling less anxious and less depressed?I work in BRA a lot, it seems coke and stims of any kind are the go to drugs.Absolutely. It's very hard. Possible but insanely hard..I agree with you? I think both food addiction and drug addiction are personal, and it can be easier for one person to break them but not another. I just added the personal bit because I'm proud of it.I would have to care about you to downvote you. Someone else downvoted your post. I chose not to respond to you, because I didn't care enough to.This was Florida pill mill days they didn't take ins. Cash only. You could go to 5 different ones in a week no problemThe people running out were the people that sold them on the streets. 120s were sold on the streets. My doctors dispensed 30s to me in office.  I called them "doctors" because they just wrote scripts all day to anyone.I got tired of trying to live how everybody else wanted me to live so I went back on medications for my social anxiety ptsd and depression. People frown upon taking klonopin and adderall because they are narcotic but if taken as prescribed like I do, I was able to get my life back, working 2 jobs, saving money, I’m just a lot happier. Screw what everybody else thinks, my life has improved drastically. Nobody needs to know about what medications I take except me and my doctor, the AA/NA program told me I wasn’t clean because I was using medication as a crutch. I’ve done 14 month totally clean of everything while working the steps and completing them and it was honestly the worst time of my life, I had things back like my health and money but the panic attacks, isolation, and depression were not worth it.yeah thats because you are paying 1.5 USD for a 3.5g sealed bag of 70~80% purity cocaine @ the streets over here

oxies, morphine (oral roa only), viminol are 100% OTC but people wont bother abusing these when you can get coke for so cheapThankfully im not in that position anymore, never plan to be again either. It always ended in robbery though. Fuck, yeah bad times. Thankfully though a few years ago.

The shame though! I haven't even told my psychiatrist or counselor yet.Okay then in that case I guess I must have somehow misunderstood your comment I apologize. And btw I wasn't trying to invalidate or take away from you the weight loss achievement, its something to be proud of and I mistook your adding it in being for a reason other than what you meant. My bad> I would have to care about you to downvote you

> I chose not to respond to you, because I didn't care enough to.

capitalizing and punctuating stuff while contradicting yourself for the third time in a row in the most attention whore manner

jesus fuck LMFAONo, you didnt respond because you fucked up royally distorting everything I said and you have zero respect to people who are simply trying to keep up a conversation without being offensive

its very unlikely for anyone to downvote me considering how dumb and manipulative you were at first and didn't apologize when being called out, its okay tho, atleast people get to know how manipulative and nasty you are

always respected you and your ideas but everyone end up showing their true colors, right?

have a wonderful dayNot an issue. It was kind of odd to add it, I'm just saying I went through the food addiction issue and still struggle with it. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Rehab friend posted this on fb, Content: , ups: 546, downs: 0I used to be racist until I got addicted to drugs


Heard that from someone, got a laugh outta that. He wasn’t being serious, just a joke Sick name rickyyy spanishhhhhhhLmao sameLol i always use “name cell” so it looks like a mobile phone number for someone but in my head I know it’s a sell phone number 6s, 7s, last resort, and good up are my connect names hahahahahaLMFAO. My favorite is "not my drug dealer" I always have "B" on mine from when I was prescribed blues. So like (fake name obv) "Adam B FL" or "Danny B LA".

The LA/FL is obviously for if it's for Florida or Louisiana. I don't think I've had an issue with somebody's last name starting with B because I'd probably not include the last name or would put the entire thing.

To anybody else it just looks like an initial. Can do the same with H. My favorite was always "not my drug dealer" lol How was rehab?I do not understand. My rehab friends post the best memesI just use a name of a girl that sounds like their own. > "Rehab friend posted this on fb"

Obvious meme has meme account @adamthehousecat watermark O_oI always said I ain't trying to buy dope from a white dude lol. Was only half serious and actually one of my best plugs was whiteSo he was still racist after getting addicted to drugs? Clever6s 7s? Started out with blues a long time ago and did the same thing. "Connect name B". That way if my main guy wasnt answering and I was desperate I could scroll thru the 292738 contacts in my phone and easily find the other connects. Wow never heard anyone else say this before I would do this but then I began having too many “Cody B’s” and “Ryan B’s” so I started mixing it and putting a spin-off on it by where I meet them. Mac Donnie(s) = McDonald’s, Sevie Elvie = 711, Walter Mart = Wal Mart Unfortunately a waste of time. Wasnt ready to stop on my own. I went because my family was pressuring me to try inpatient actual rehab after outpatient didnt work a few times. Did like 40 days total including a 5 day detox as well. Both the detox and rehab were beautiful places. The rehab put you up in a marriot hotel.. met alot of good ppl.. learned alot. But yeah I wasnt ready to stop. The good thing is though is that I genuinely feel like I'm gonna stop soon. Idk it's been like 10-15 years total of this shit and I'm almost there I think being ready to stop because I want to for the first time. We'll see how it goes."Black Dude I Buy Drugs From" is the name assigned in the blue messager's phone to the grey text messager, who just requested to be labeled something innocuous in said phone. I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. I feel like your trying to call me out saying I took a meme from a meme account. If that's the case miss me with that shit. And if you provide me with a way.. I can text or email you a screenshot of it. Groups of people and that’s what they call them selves. $6 bags and $7 bagsHaha yeah when I first started doing it... it's actually kind of a mean story, a middle I knew was a very reliable source but I had to hand off funds and she always took one (and charged me more than they cost - I don't mind charging a bit more or asking for one but not both, even when I found out the real price she still lied but that's another story). Anyways she was just... gross. Huge and just, you know, not an attractive girl. I don't usually base things off of people's appearances but for this story I have to.

Anyways, I didn't have many people in my phone and was going to save her as (different name) "Jessica Blue" but thought that was too obvious and changed it to "Jessica Bleagh" (like the "yuck" sound, "blech!") due to the aforementioned appearance, which I realize was kind of dick, and (mostly) to the fact that I was pissed she was lying to me for more money every time even after I'd flat out caught her.

Funny story as to how I eventually found out for sure she was lying to me about the price (because they never admit it so you can never REALLY be 100%) is that she called her connect to set up the deal after talking to me but called me back instead so she flat out said how many she wanted and what the total would be. Once she realized it was me she backtracked and tried to cover, then acted like SHE was mad at ME for not identifying myself, anything she could do to try to make up for the fact that she'd just told me the real price. I couldn't believe the fuckup on her part.

Anyways, back to the contacts thing, one day she was going to use my phone so I changed it to just "b" in case she happened to see her own contact and I realized that was way better. Been my go-to for.. Jesus Christ, over a decade almost. I can't believe how long it's been, and I hate when I do because it makes me realize how much of my fucking life I've wasted, shit. I'm in the same boat as you dude. I'm so sick of this lifestyle. I used to smile putting a needle of Dilaudid in my arm. Now I shoot some heroin and read. I don't enjoy it anymore. It's been 10 years of this shit. I've been clean like 6 days now. *sheds single tear* 

The hero we need, but don't deserve.No... Just that your friend isn't this meme account, and you're an idiot if you think this really happened to him.

This was made for entertainment by a meme account.

What you did or what you believe is irrelevant. Nobody accused you of being intelligent.Lmao got it Yea can’t stand a stingy middle

Had a guy that wanted 10 in gas and damn near half of what I was getting ONTOP of a waxed price

So one day he went in the store and left his tablet in there(he used one of those text apps) and dumbass didn’t have a code on it Litterly took all the numbers out and on to my phone

And since he was a stingy dickhead his whole life I told people to just come thru from me instead (told them actual prices and wanted significantly less then he did)

So not only I got out on him for his numbers AND his people lmao this was when I first started doing dope to massive comeup FUCK middles deal with they’re shit long enough to get the numbers and leave em in the dustHa, mine we're all labeled as pizza places, like "best sf pizza"Shit I'd do anything to be on day 6. The first 5ish or so days of total agony are over. Good shit man for real I know it still sucks but the horrible part is almost over just keep going!!holy shit a bunch of yall couldnt figure this out?All I said was that my friend posted this on Facebook. At no point did I say he created it. Obviously everyone sees the watermark. Once again miss me with that shit. Everyone enjoyed it. 300 something upvotes and you had to be the 1 out of 300 that had to be a douche. I have nothing but love to give to this sub.. it's just ppl like you.. like why are you trying to come at me? Why not just fit in with the rest of the group and be normal and just enjoy the shit? Think about it 1 out of 300.  I'll give it to you.. you're definitely something else. Have a good day. 

Edit now 430 ppl so you're 1 out of 430.Hahaha yeah that's how I got that middle actually. I had to use ANOTHER middle to get them, it was the fucking worst. I'd go pick up the first girl, go with her to pick up the middle, then all go to do the deal. Was a fucking nightmare but I didn't know anyone.

So one time we stop at a gas station. Usually she tried not to let us be alone, but I had gone in to buy something and the middle (the second) came in after. She came up to me and said how stupid it was to have to pay two people and gave me her number.

I had been calling the first one every few days so once I stopped she knew what was up. Whatever, fuck her. I get trying to get your piece, but people that are "friends" but put the dope first and try to rip you off this way can fuck off. Any time a friend had asked me for a connect, I give it to them. All I do first is call the guy to ask them if it's alright to give their number. OMG me and one of my guys talk about pizza! Hey you got any pizza? Is it that pizza with the chunky sauce? Hey, same pizza as last time or new pizza? I didn't like that pizza with the really white sauce, the darker one was better. Hey man that last pizza was all soggy and I couldn't eat it.

Hey man I'm starving to death over here, you made a pizza yet?

It works surprisingly well. Same. All were pizza places, all talk was in terms of pizza, etc. Fucking expensive pizza.�Is kratom legal where you live? That can help you to get off while avoiding the worse withdrawal symptoms, it even handles low level cravings. Kratom helped me get off of heroin and now I have 3 months clean. It feels a lot longer than 3 months lolLol I was jokingRight, no one accused you of being intelligent.

Bro get a life wtf are you worried about? 1 comment about how you took this from a meme page and say it was from "your friend"?

Why do you even care?

Why are you so sensitive?

Take your 300 upvotes and go jerk off you fucking cuck

Edit:

You make me feel like I'm beating up a retarded child bruhI do alot of middleing and that's how i usually do it if we're good pals it's eather hook me up and get it at cost or pay a tax and don't hook me up...get a kick out of ppl who r surprised when u want to get hooked up ...there like i only got x amount..well felony's are not free..i get n the same amount of shit if u get 2 bags or 2 gramsAH!  Im so glad Im not alone lol, at one point someone looked at my phone and commented that I really like pizza.  I was like yup, sure do :)To be honest I'm not even sure if it's legal by me. I'm in a very popular NE city. I've been living this life for a long time & I've never not once seen kratom. Read on here all the time smoke shops have it but I know the ones by me dont & I've never seen it on the street. I used to either get a legit script for subs or get them off the street but I never liked subs. My last detox i did a 4 or 5 day methadone taper in an actual facility and it was the best experience I've had detoxing.. practically painless. If and when I'm ready to get clean I'd prob do that again. I was expecting WDs when I got out of detox after the methadone but they were really mild. No hot and cold sweats shits none of that.. just that really sluggish body feels like it weighs 1000 pounds feeling which for me.is tolerable. I'm totally fine with that, just be straight up about it. Don't tax it but tell me you're doing it for free and trying to be my friend, because I will immediately never trust you again. Don't make me throw you something AND tax me on top of it. I get you have the control in the situation, and I get that in this lifestyle it's basically every man for himself, but there should still be some level of decency (especially between friends). There's nothing wrong with getting your cut - I get the risk taking explanation but even if there was NO risk you still deserve it - just be up-front about it. Haha yeah. That's why I did it, plus just in case the other guy ever gets grabbed or something that's easy to deny. I should do it with my other guys too tbhWell said my dude.Ur rite i like to play the game as fair as possible 
And try to b straight up with ppl..like i said no tax and get me well or pay a tax..if it's some weasel then i may tax em n want a shot..but there not many good ppl left in the game everyone out for themselves​ @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Shits too real:(, Content: , ups: 550, downs: 0This is pretty funny, although most of our plugs are like "now get tf off the block before you do that shit !"epic meme very repostI hope there's no afterlife.

My dad passed away last month stage 4 cancer, we’re about to go homeless now, I have PTI that I might not have the money for trying to not go homeless, my mom has open heart surgery last month, had relationship problems last month now getting better, almost out of food in my house, might not have gas money to get to PTI, I work my ass off just everything happened at once. I quit doing opiates but other than that man life fucking sucks and I’m scared asf being homeless or possible jail.... an I’m only 23 years old my goal for college is literally 0% at the moment, always wanted to go. I love this episode ���I thought I had hit rock bottom... Then found out there's a basement I’ve hit a point in my life where almost every day I take kratom and watch it’s always sunny at night by myself and it’s starting to make sad. LOL unrelated but when people say BIG FUCKING FACTS BRUH I wanna be like, those are xtra small facts Julio. And that shit you said about Lloyds sister? Cornelius thinks it's medium-rare facts.That's one of my all-time favorite parts on the show. Haha!DISCLAIMER: Found this on Facebook, not my meme but I thought all my junkster friends would get a hyuck-hyuckster out of it � *awkward laugh at my shitty punny rhyme I love so much*Lmfao Normius RepostusrerereREEEEPOSTUS MC.POSTINGTONUSOh man my prayers and best wishes go out to you man.... I am so sorry you are literally a trooper and bless you for staying sober.I’m so sorry to hear this. There are resources you can try to reach out to for help to prevent eviction. Are you being evicted because you haven’t paid bills?

As for food... look up food pantry’s in your area. Also... you’re going through a really tough time right now. Hang in there. Things will get better. Your goal of college may not be possible this very minute, but it could be in the future. Have you talked to a financial aid counselor recently? Since the loss of you Dad and assuming your mom isn’t making a whole lot of money, you may be eligible for grants and student loans to cover living expenses and tuition. Don’t give up on this goal. It may be delayed compared to your original plan, but it’s still a possibility. Stay strong brother.Just for today my brother, I hear where your at just hang in there just for today much love Look on back of your gas/power bill. There is usually a phone number to call if you are having trouble paying your bill. Ive used it before and there are non-profit organizations who will help you pay your bill . Even if it's about to get cut offI'm so sorry you've had to go through this. I don't know if you're religious, (I don't really know if I am either) but I'll be praying for you tonight. If there's anything I, or anyone else on this subreddit could do to help, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck bud. 
Sending my love and prayers - K[deleted]Why does it make you sad?so basically i adjusted the root of an onion's wheel to match the scroutus of you rice jenklings, then subsided gender and glimmer ratio to find how long the flungus had to be stretched to appropriately execute this particular type of mandingus.

not that complicated..The facts are 5 inches by 8 inches It's from Facebook so I suppose you're right. I haven't seen it on the opiates sub tho and I thought some might find it funny :)I'll pray for you too. I been paying bills like water and electric. My mom needs electric because of her meds for her heart the refrigerator plus food. Then we gotta also stay clean for my job. It’s just rent is $850 and we don’t have it and it’s the end of the month. Good ideaI hope man my mom isn’t making any money right now she can’t work. I’m the only one but all my money has to go to PTI at a bad time. Plus my mom applied for SSI, my dads death cert, and disability but that can take forever with the government. What? Haha penis tract?  Is that the scientific term? ��Because I’ve developed a reputation amongst my friends of being the burn out who works a dead end job and watches it’s always sunny every night. That...... was....... BOUNTIFULLY BOOTIFULCall my dick big facts because it's the truth, 



...... and uh bigyeaa its been here once or twice.
but im just jacking your raisin druggy balls tho ;)Lol thanks? I can't tell if this is being nice or sarcastic because I'm a dope feenYou may want to contact local churches in your area to see if they can help with rent this month. Catholic charities helps in my area. Maybe they help in yours as well. 

Also is your mom assigned a social worker/health navigator through wherever she received the surgery (check with the hospital). If not, contact the hospital that treated your dad and ask to speak with the cancer navigator. Let them know that since your Dad became ill that your mom doesn’t have rent money for this month and that she’s having trouble paying electric bills. They can set you up with resources to get aid. 

There are services to prevent becoming homeless in situations like this. It takes time to find them, but it’s worth not living on the streets. Plus your mom can’t live like that right now. You got this, friend. Life is really hard right now, but you can do it. Where’s do you live? In colder states they can not evict you in winter months [deleted][deleted]Have they said something to you about it? 

Maybe go outside and walk around?[deleted]I was not being sarcastic, so it must be the other. This was really kind of you.  Listen to this guy op you will beat this Unfortunately I live in South Carolina down South. But it still gets cold asf in the winter down here and my car heater is broken so fml! Great idea I don't recommend waiting to get the attorney for countless reasons, this "3rd time's a charm" thing utterly asinine, please do not take that bad advice as gospel. This is coming from someone that draws disability. 

She *DOES NOT* need to hesitate, that is the #1 reason why a given person is still waiting or what have you. Applying may also in and of itself help you keep your place. Call tomorrow! The first back payment alone will be a nice chunk, and again, the sooner the ball gets rolling, the better. Good luck. Oh lmao nah man PTI as in I got in a fight with a dude that started it but there making me take classes instead of jail which I’m grateful for. Honestly that was funny though man I’m sure it was sarcasm but never know. Must be huhNot sure where you are in SC, but in here Columbia, there is the Oliver Gospel Mission and Harvest Hope - both great places that offer assistance. Not an idea.. just sayin’ maybe he has a little more time than he thought to get things straight since he is concerned about being immediately homeless due to not being able to make rent this month. 

Edit: clarification [deleted]OkCringe @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Yup, Content: , ups: 534, downs: 0�����Im a junkie fr fr but could never steal my grandmas pain meds .....sorry mom n dad n sister n ex girlfrind tho�Love it lolYeah I steal my grandmas oxy all the time! She was an evil butch when I was growing up so I feel like it evens out! Haha..I've done this. She had cancer and passed last year and I still think about how big of a piece of shit I was every day. I'm clean now and I'm glad she got to see me clean up my life but I can't shake how terrible I was to her when I was using. Her and my grandfather both had cancer and I was staying with them. I would steal their pills, money, car and lie to them. My grandpa never got to see me get better but she did for a couple months. She never forgave me before she went and it kills me every day.Sorry nanathis one made me laugh �Yeah I admit I did shit like this when I was younger. I even replaced my own hydros with Tylenol in case my mother checked and wondered why the fuck they were gone.Or filling the hydro syrup back up with robitusson Lmfaooo that’s tuff Bahahahaha too funny. I lobe this opiod forum on reddit. Im a POS. I replaced my.dads hydros with tylenol and his xanax with muscle relaxers. Im a disgusting excuse for a human.Ouchu/h2_woe�������

It be like that tho Lmao been there with mom & dad’s meds. I’m not a total monster I waited until I knew they weren’t using  them after their surgeries Just take the bottle. She so old she’ll forget she had them. Oxy is like deer. It can be singular or plural. Please OP, Could your *junkie ass* use proper grammar when stealing grandma's oxy?yesss if ur here and haven't done that ur not a real one Any oxy in sight that is laying around like tylenol. Is basically mine. Theyre basically saying here, fuck the advil take soke of this mahical ozyķksk(sks1Yea it don't get much worse then denying an old sick person with cancer there constant doses of pain meds. Most elders in pain don't take it all day everyday so there tends to be lots laying around. I was about to steal my grandma's fetttie  patch off her chest while she was on her death bed. The only reason I didn't was because I'm sure the person I visited her with would have caught the blame. Funny how getting caught was more of a deterrant than depriving my grams of rent while dieing. SmdhI'll be honest with you, you should feel bad. You can't apologize to the dead, and they can't forgive you. I hope you learned from your mistake tho, which you stated. Addiction is q  fucking devili can imagine the only thing she wanted for you is to quit using. i think it’s the best thing you can do for yourself and your consciencelol it's funny that this would be downvoted when it's literally the same message as the meme and most of the other comments.Really? This? This is the hill? Ok..Bullshit. I'm as real as it gets. Been shooting dope almost 20 years. Literally spent over a million on heroin, that I worked for and earned.

You don't have to steal at all, especially from sick elderly people, to be a "real one". That's disgusting.[deleted]Honestly. Dude stole cancer medication from his *fucking dying family*. Doesn't get any lower than that. I tell myself that every day. I hope it's true. I hope that they can somehow see me and how good things are going now.Fr. I just left out the part where I talk about how I feel bad about it. Well right now that I have a full time job and all I wouldn't I get what u mean ,,, when I started doing pills I was round 16 I did steal other people's meds most of us have..This guy is bragging about shooting dope for 20 years and wasting a million dollars. Holy shit.Literally nodded off in the middle of the comment. Im doin a half of yellow perk ten for filler mixed with half a valium and half a pink oxy 10 and half a oxy 30. So im all fugged upjesus, he obviously knows. no need for everyone to line up to shit on him. i bet you've never done any kind of scummy junkie shit in your life.I stole some of my grandma's meds after she died from lung cancer , I never would have taken them from her while she was alive and in pain; thats hella fucked up.

I also took my dad's pain meds, but that was after he told me he hates opiates and they make him sick. I only stole a little over half of them, usually 2 or 3 every few days until he caught on that he was missing a bunch and he threw them away. 

Point of the story is, it's okay to take them if people either aint gonna miss them (cuz they kicked the bucket already), or if they are literally of no use to the person and they are gonna get thrown away. Ones man's trash is another man's treasure and all that.

I would never steal someones pain meds that need them to function/survive. Thats really fucked up, no matter if most people have done it or not. Normalizing stealing someones meds is not okay my dude.That's why I call bullshit.Why take half? I got 2 10 mg oxy pinks im bout to chew up rnPeople don’t *usually* need the pain meds to function/survive at all 

Another comments example was something a long the lines of “old people in pain don’t take them all day every day so there tends to be plenty just laying around” it’s not moral and it’s not okay but don’t act like you’re THAT much better than these people by buying and shooting a million dollars worth of heroin over a 20 year period instead of stealing a few pain pills lmao 

*I never stole a relatives pain meds btw, dead or alive*I kist take half to try to make everyrhijg last longer lmao these drugs cost to much but either way im getting fucked upYou don't make any sense. Half a perc 10 = 5. Half a 10 mg pink = 5. Just take one and save the other.

How did that go?Went ok, 3 day job turned into 6, then our plane broke � so we hired a local fixer to show us some beaches for the next 2 days while waiting for parts. Beautiful country side outside the slums, nice locals as well. 
Good man doesn't sound like a terrible time and definitely seems safer than the other options. Probably still seemed like you weren't far from home since we have our fair share of haitians.Yeah, reminded me of being in Lake Park � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Every upvote will be one minute that I'm sober., Content: stole this from the r/drunk guy on the front page and shot for a more realistic goal :o)

Got my first reddit gold in 4 years for it though lol. Found this sub reddit because of that comment. Gotta love redditYes. I think one guy was a month. He had to go to the ER. Ahh yes. The dreaded encounter with the concrete python. Don’t judge but I had to use my wife and I Astro glide once to lube up my rear end so it would slide out.  It worked pretty damn good!Hey that’s the only reason why I’m surfing this reddit! I’m actually quite intrigued people here are abusing and are addicted. I thought it was about pharmacology....
Damn. He got us. Discovered this sub from there and thanks for the laughs going through a shitty time and y’all made me chuckle *laughs in linzess*I know a junkie from my little town, he didn't pooped for 24days, I don't know if this was the cause, but now he has severe colon cancer... 
On nucynta for pain management. Legit haven't shat in four days. I just wanna poop man!I took a huge shit around midnight because I had my last little piece saved for my final time using before I try and kick again. After cleaning out my bowels pretty well, I did my first and last booty bump. I have never slammed and I know I couldn’t do it just once, so I prepped 0.3 of some tar and I sent that dark slime up my ass. I was nervous about it coming out so i jumped down on my stomach and laid there for about ten minutes. I got pretty high but still didn’t catch a nod. I don’t know why but no matter how much i do or how i administer it, heroin gives me speed like energy and meth calms me down. Pointless story but I shit at midnight.Two solid bowl movement today. Roll Tide.

Diet, exercise, and hydration are key if you dont want to feel like shit and not be able to shit.I went here from thatI’m glad I made you laugh :)

I wrote that right before going to bed and now when I woke up, I saw it had 14 k upvotes  xDYou can’t poop if you never eat... 
r/stimsonce a year Since 2008 (when I started getting on opiates) I’d go atleast 3-4 weeks without having any bowel movements. Now that I’ve been on Adderall for 2 years now as well I’ve found that it helps even out opiate constipation. I pooped like 4 times since 2018 endedI love you guysI came from there lolI came onto this subreddit because of that comment i giggle snorted
I’m currently on another few-week problem shits that I’m trying to resolve. It’s at that point where it’s starting to hurt my stomach, it’s kind of a cycle lol. I feel like I haven’t taken a proper shit in months.You ever push so hard you ejaculate?Taking a shit as I read this lmaoPretty sure I've got one stuck from '99How about for the ladies; who can go the longest without a period?? I’m looking to go three years in a rowFam I've made it CRAZY amounts of time without doing a NUMBER 2, Pretty sure when I FIRST got on the methadone, it took ages to adjust to my dose and I didn't go for 2 months (possibly even longer, that's how scared I was to go) . Needless to say, when I finally did go, it sounded like a demon was being exorcised. Obviously, I was controlling my eating during this period, and i'm not a big fan of food anyway so not eating for long amounts of time doesn't bother me. After you don't go for a week and then you have a 5lb shit it's called having a heroin baby.The relief is gonna be so sweet mannnnlmao, well, they aren't wrong...It was like right there almost crowning lol guiltyOh my God ���Is anyone familiar with skin problems due to what I can only assume is from long term constipation? The symptoms are like skin all over my body is constantly flaking and like shedding these little specs of black, grey, or tan. It’s like a plaque buildup on my nails and cuticles also. Been dealing with this purgatory for literally years. Been to dozens of doctors but no fix, maybe bc I don’t admit to them that I use Fentanyl and previously tar. Any help would be eternally appreciated, if I could pay for a cure no price would seem unreasonable, like this has been ruining my life.It was you!! 2.1k opiate users in 2 hours. I wish that was surprising. [deleted]Welcome come check out the place and see what it’s like to be an addict. I always enjoy people seeing what it’s really like because it somewhat de-stigmatizes it some what. 

My only concern is whenever we are mentioned on the front page or something we get a bunch of people coming here telling us to kill ourselves and we’re fucking junkie scum and all that. welcome, welcome.Yeah I hit 3 weeks one time. It felt like I had a 6 foot curved concrete turd in me. My hemorrhoids were under so much pressure my asshole probably looked like a head of cauliflower. It hurt to walk. After I started to vomit feces I knew I was close to dying. I went to the ER and they said, "you need to go poop, take a laxitive" and sent me home. Like I hadn't been eating them all day for a week. The next day I fought the beast for 5 hours, digging little bits out at a time with my index finger. At this point my asshole was raw, bleeding, and my hemmies felt like giant stretched out balloons. I took one more push with all the strength in my body and a Pringles can sized turd ripped my ass wide open. It was simultaneously the most painful and liberating feeling in my life. I couldn't wipe so I just got on all fours in the shower and let it clean me. I remember the feeling. Shaking. About to pass out. The feeling of the monster moving out of my ass before I could get my finger out. Horrible horrible month it was.OMGI heard a nurse ends up needing to use her hand at that point. Not sure how true My doctor recommended to put on a glove and then oil up my butthole and the inside of my anus with veggie oil right before I go to prevent tearing and to make it a little less painful. Seriously?my butthole is litterally in pain thinking about this.


i mean that generally the normal response once i start thinking, but that's not the point!That might have been meI'm sober now, but when I was in the throes of my addiction I'd sometimes bust out an enema. No judgements here �I've legit dug poop out my ass in desperation once. It was both discussing and satisfying at the same time.

I have severe RA and narcotics are my only source of pain relief.Thats true loveI can never get lube to work. I keep a box of latex gloves right next to the shitter for those stubborn days. ��
This place is full of degenerates and foul mouthed people doing stupid stuff. It's a wonderful place. pharmacology is discussed very frequently here. Hey man, tomato tomatoeI’m a chronic pain patient who takes her prescribed medication as directed, but I’m no better than anyone else here. And neither are you. I'm literally also only here cause of this post... But enjoying reading the stories here quite a bit! Praying for everyone here to have a safe year.

Edit: typo/r/stims is good tooHow do you find Nucynta for helping w pain? Ive only taken it recreationally and it was fucking awful for me. Made me feel 10x worse than I already did (withdrawals) so i wrote it off as “never touch again”. But ive heard it mentioned more and more in a postive light here recently. Same for me. I always attributed that to my ADHD. For 24 hoursI'd stare at a computer and learn how to build Android apps on meth. If I wanted the house clean I'd use opiates Too bad you couldn’t have timed it so one piece splashed down right at 11:59 and 9/10ths of a second and continued to splash until 12:00 and 1/10ths of a second while up above another piece had just breached the hole so you would have been probably one of very few who had the very last and first poop of the year.. 18&19 respectively.   
Well I guess we have something to aim for this year on New Years... only 363 days to go. I’m gonna go eat some fiber and Taco Bell.You shit so hard the bowl moved?

Haagen daz and heroinStay for the heroin and life of crime.Same lolShow off...Hahahahahah that's awesome! My ex wife went about that long too. 

Quick question. If you aren't having your period does that also mean you don't ovulate? Which in turn means you couldn't get pregnant? I'm one of us it's ok.[deleted]Vomiting …feces? YikesDear lord...This had be dying laughing at work partially because of how relatable it is...I write as I sit on the shitter excreting tiny rock hard pebbles of pooGod. Damn.Holy shitYou honestly just made me cry laughing. I am so sorry that shit happened to you, pun intended I guess.I loled. How could you go that far?!? I had my moments on methadone, but gd, 1 week is *forever* to not poop.He was a hurting dude. Usually true, or some kind of digging tool, or possibly even surgery. At that point things are so compacted bowel movements aren't possible anymore and it has to be removed by some other means. [deleted]i had to have what is called a ‘fecal disimpaction” done at one point. it was painful. they did give me IV dilaudid and ativan though which was nice. Also professionally known as *digital extraction*.Quite common. My mom was a nurse and I suffered from constipation as a kid. If I couldn't get it out, and was on the toilet crying and suffering. She would glove and lube up, and helped get it started to come out for me, as she was taught.
Nowadays the nurses tell you to do it yourself and hand you some gloves. Yes. I knew a woman who was very lucky to not get a colostomy bag. They removed several feet of dead intestine. So yes this can happen.Read my story in this thread. SeriouslyYes. I searched but nothing. I try to go every three days. After that, pain is a sure thing. I couldn't find your postYea enemas were my saving grace, is it bad that I looked forward to it, because it felt nice to get that outWhat's RA?I had to do that a couple of weeks ago. My poor boyfriend sat in the bathroom with me while I cried cuz I was in so much pain. The man is a trooper. “That’s black love.” — Whitney Houston, after husband Bobby Brown assisted her with this problem, using internal manipulation with his fingers. (For you youngsters, Whitney and Bobby had a reality show that followed their day-to-day lives, and this incident was documented.)I’m not an opiate user but I have used in the past and still visit this sub. Just want to say thank you for actually coming to the sub and not saying something disrespectful or unnecessary. There are good genuine people hear. 

Usually when this sub is mentioned else where it’s extremely talked down upon.If you shoot them it makes your butthole tingle.It's the only pain killer that for some reason I don't build much of a tolerance for, which is awesome because I hate upping doses on medications.

It's expensive AF though.

Thankfully my withdrawal symptoms when I stop cold turkey are pretty mild.

I like it for pain management :)Don't they give you amphetamines for adhd?The world needs people like us. Truly I honestly think the crazy can’t sit still dreamers and tinkerers with a hand in every pot kind of people drive creativity and invention and have pushed the human race towards all kinds of new and exciting and great things. Else we’d still be sitting around a fire that some guy made with sticks eating the same shit we did yesterday in some dark part of Africa or Europe. But one day a gene mutated and even though little eddy got yelled at a lot as a kid and was always in trouble he said fuuuuuck this I’m going over there with this stick and that one too maybe this rock hey where’d I put my other rock thing anyhow yeah I’m outta here.. few hundred thousand years later here I am same mutation from a long line of annoying always getting into trouble Eddy’s wondering what to do next.Unmedicated, working on 150 different projects I'll never finishHaha could have sworn I said bowel... I'm going to blame autocorrect. I am known to bring the thunder though. > side effects: withdrawal symptoms

Methylnaltrexone 14 thousand.. I got notifications and I mean if one of my posts or comments get a lot of upvotes I get happy? Woah that was the biggest mindfuck. 

I don’t think so though because I still have to be really careful about getting pregnant/giving birth to a opioid dependent baby... I don’t want to me THAT person ya know. Also I think we still go trough “PMS” everything but the blood... and pain. Sometimes I get frustrated or emotional and I think to myself “is this my phantom period...?”[deleted]WEEEEENYup. That's sign your colon is so full that your small intestine shoots nasty black bile shit up through your stomachReminds me of South Park when they are shitting out their mouth.>Vomiting ...feces?

There’s another condition that causes that but I can’t quite remember what it is. (Probably more than one, but one in particular I heard about not too long ago.)

It, too, was an intestinal blockage, but with a different underlying cause. Same result, though — feces eventually comes up the wrong way and ... horrorshow.Had it happen to me..  not from opiates but for an unknown reason. I was 14 at the time and it was horrible and scary. Ended up going to the ER after 19 days of no shitting and they put a tube up my nose all the way down my throat then into my stomach and they pumped 2 gallons of a special liquid into me and it took like 12 hours to kick in but once it did, I was shitting straight water. I was still in the hospital and if I didn’t have my butt cheeks clenched then shit would spray down my legs and everytime I stood up to go to the toilet I’d have extremely watery poop come out and it left a trail everytime :d 

They left the tube in for 2 days but took it out early because I ended up throwing up poop AGAIN and the tube came up and I started choking on it so the nurses came in after I was choking for 2 minutes and by the time they got there I was already UNCONSCIOUS 


When I left the hospital they weighed me and I lost 14 pounds i once went about 2 weeks.....after my time in the hospital.


being on methadone, vicodins, and not moving because of a broken leg made it so bad. I was one day from going to the ER. I was litterally crying in bed. I took like every laxative, enema, magnesium sulfate, etc. Like I couldn't even pee, that's how constipated i was


then at 3AM....the whole house was greeted to my shouting "AHAHAHAHAHA!!!! FUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK YOOOOOU!!!"


to which i heard my dad shout in a half awake voice "get that shit outta here!"


XD[deleted]This is how you scare kids off of drugs*nods knowingly*>fecal disimpaction

I'm saddened this isn't a Cannibal Corpse or Dying Fetus songI dont know if i could ever look at my mom the same way after her fingers being in my bunghole..Fuck!!Oh it was a comment months ago. I hadn't shat in like a month I eventually had to go to the ER for an emergency enema in the middle of the nightThere are few things in this world that provide such relief and euphoria as finally managing a shit after a week or two. 

I solved my two-week stint with loads of spicy food and gallons of coffee. I've left the experience behind, but have been carrying the resulting caffeine addiction since. It was the only thing that ensured I had a daily movement for a while after that. Rhumeatoid ArthritisRheumatoid arthritisI'd guess possibly rheumatoid arthritis Tianeptine (highly discourage anyone from shooting Tia. Very dumb)  would do that same thing. First time i thought i like pissed myself or something. HahaYes but it has a milder effect for us with adhd than for those without. It does still stimulate to a degree but at the same time helps focuses the mind ON ONE THING. The inability to stay focused for any good period of time is probably the worst of the symptoms of the disorder. Welcome to the Thunderdome!Both were just jokes. Yeah I understand how it works and it really was a clever comment. It takes on a new meaning here where a good poop is an event not just a daily occurrence.Damn son! Sounds fucking roughThe relief is intense. Dear God, I'm so sorry! I had gone about that long myself, and it was beyond a horrific experience getting that "concrete shit baby" out! 
I mean, I bled, for months after, everytime I had to go #2. I wouldn't want to eat even when starving bc ik it would have to come out and it was so painful my body and mind was like fuck eating. I drank alot of ensure and smoothirs during that time, but still. Anyway sorry if TMI. I just dont think people quite understand how absolutely painful extreme constipation and the aftermath can be. I had one when I first got on methadone that was literally ass cheek bone to ass cheek bone and the size of a softball. It was also a 2 weeker.I can honestly say I have gone at least 3 1/2 weeks to 4 without any movement in my bowels. Bf was freaking out, saying I have to go to the ER! I have never in my life been regular, but I did have to deal with the discomfort, on H that all disappeared, you don’t have a digestive system anymore! It just goes into hibernation! And yes the most intense was the almost 4 week mark, but I had to remind him 4 out of 7 days I wasn’t eating much more than a pint of Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked and a coke...so I wasn’t putting much in. Still not so happy I have to eat and shit, just wish I could do away with those! You’re giving me flashbacks to 2005 bro chill. I read this sub to fall asleep. Without nightmares. It absolutely should be. Dang why didn't I think of that. ThanksYup Tia was my last and final relapse. Shot it for 6 months and I'm not joking, I literally have no veins left except my dick and femoral. My neck has hardened up and has a very serious abscess at a point. My forearms and kneews were wrecked. All for a high that loses the magic in 2 days. It's the insanity thinking it'll be "different the next shot I'll do more" and "I won't get injured I'm not like them" well both of those happened and quick. Avoid this drug as much as possibleI’ve not been near your 2 week record but after only like 5 days my shit was so hard and impossible to move. 

Had to reach in there and break parts off. Is that bad? It passed eventually though lolI've been on heroin for over 6 years now, and though I see these kind of complaints really often, I don't get why you put yourselves through it. When I'd not been on heroin for long and just picked up a habit and was in a situation where the H was practically unlimited, one time I ended up constipated for 2 weeks and then having really awful abdominal and bowel pain for a couple of hours until I finally had the biggest shit of my life. It was a traumatic experience and though I look back on it amused now, going through it was hell. Since then to avoid it I just make sure that every 2 or 3 days I hold off on my morning dose until I've taken a shit. Sure, I'd rather take a shot as soon as I wake up, but I only have to endure an hour or 2 of the mild beginning withdrawal symptoms before I can go to the bathroom and then I'm all good and can take my hit. It's a mild inconvenience but it's a damn sight better than writhing around in agony on the toilet trying to give birth out my ass at 3 in the morning. Why doesn't everyone do this??? anybody that takes opiates everyday or often should also be taking a stool softener everyday. since i started taking my zub i couldn’t go #1 or #2 for a week but now that i incorporate the softener i’ve not had a problem since [deleted]Tia is like shooting elmers glue. Its use/abuse is not sustainable whatsoever. Hats off to you for staying away from it. I never got hooked to it, just used it in desperate times. Its withdrawals are supposed to be rough arent they? I think I remember reading its got SSRI-like properties or something along those lines?When you were young and naive... but now you are... **THE POOPSHIPDESTROYER**This is just all too relatable...I closed my eyes and saw myself, frozen still with every muscle in my body tensed, sweat building at my hairline and feeling that first of many pain-sweats trickle down the side of my face, focusing all my strength on pushing out what I already know is damn impossible to do with injury...grabbing toilet paper and basically picking the rock out of my asshole....here’s to a better year and more Metamucil<3 Ween![deleted]I’m having vivid flashbacks. When I got done with detox and into rehab they gave me Miralax and I fucking loved it. I’d get so fucking hyped when I needed to shit. It was � as the kids say. lost in the sauce once again

&#x200B;This thread is fucking gold @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 21 years ago I quit heroin, Benzos, meth, and alcohol., Content: , ups: 1471, downs: 0I’m coming up on 2 years March 1. Happy anniversary! �Congrats, that’s amazing! You're awesome!! ���

Congrats and Happy Birthday!

Thank you for all you do ��Thanks for everything you’ve done for this community. You’re a legend whose legitimately saved lives. Much love!I've never used but as your flair says, you're the heroine of heroin.

Keep inspiring and helping people Tracey, you're amazing.21 years...wow! Congrats!!
I wish I could make it to 1 year....Thank you for everything you've done for this community Tracey.  You have pushed harm reduction, saved lives with Narcan, and I think most importantly helped HUMANIZED us "worthless addicts" to a larger populace.  

I, like thousands of people in this subreddit, appreciate the fuck out of you.  I've got 4 years heroin free and am considering getting a career change into addiction therapy - if I can help a percentage of the people you have I will consider my life a success. 

Congrats again, and much love!That's a really huge accomplishment!! Congratulations �Man, I can't imagine what that detox was like. My best friend hung him self while detoxing after a monstrous run on meth heroin and benzos in January. Thanks for spreading the word, showing us how it can he done.So, is an ice cream guaranteed with 21 years of sobriety?!?!

Lol!

Congratulations!! You are an inspiration and I am so proud of you!So, my standard question - do you find the clean life boring? 

A lot of people here seem to have this as a big concern.

You know, cause chasing dope is so much fun and all. 

Would be interested in your opinion. Super congratulations!Tracey! From The Dark End of The Street??Hell yeah, congratulations!!It’s crazy to me that you’re part of this sub with all of us and that I’m able to communicate with you, after seeing the Dark End of the Street in 8th grade lol congratulations on 21 years, happy for your sobrietyAmazing! Congratulations! XoWell done Tracey You quit when I was 2 years old, that's super awesome. Hoping I get there one day. Amazing Tracy you are a role model to so many of us.  I have two and a half years and I look to you for inspiration.  You’re killing it girl!I've been clean from coke and benzos and weed like.... Nearly a year. Still depressed but when I go to sleep I thank God I'm alive and soberYour story shows me that it is possible for anyone to get off this shit. Thank you for all you do from some stranger You're a real-life super hero! The real MVP.\m/Congratufuckinglations!!! That is no easy task a d that's a long stretch. Go do treat yo self!!!You Rock! Congrats �Legend! Wish I could kick benzos; I'm a week and a half off morphine using kratom but I've taken probably 50 xanax barsTracy youre fucking awesome I saw the doc you were in and what a turnaround youve made! Im 28 right now and struggling with staying clean from black which isnt good considering im on parole with a 4 year suspended prison sentence, so the stakes are so high... Too bad they dont know how fucking hard it is to come off this shit. I was on suboxone program 3 yrs ago and then got the vivitrol shot after i was released from jail last year and my countys(San Jose- Santa Clara county, CA)program is so fucked they said because i have gotten the vivitrol shot, thats now my ONLY option, and i cant switch to the sub or methadone program. So stupid. Either way youre still an inspiration and its awesome that youre from my area(as in the SF Bay AREA)Kudos to you amigo I know how that goes my go to combo is Adderall,benzos, and some sort of opiate. I drink alcohol with them if it’s around but letting anything have a hold on you isn’t worth it in the end but yet we still continue to do shit we know we shouldn’t.. glad you’re free from it I’d love to swap stories lol good luck to you and have a nice day �Just got 7 months myself! I remember seeing your story on a documentary, thanks for the inspiration. We do recover that's absolutely amazing, congrats : ) i'd love to give you gold but i'm poor, so here: �MMmmmmm heroin and ice cream.

Seriously though, great job, I watched the HBO doc. years ago, and have been following you for a while. Read your first post and AMA here. Even the Dopey podcast stuff! You do a lot of good in HR and alike. I'm glad that shit is in my past too. Life in color is so much better (no reference to the pictures intended).We met somewhere on here before. You are looking great!Tracy you are a champWooop wooop congrats and thanks for what you do!! ❤️Happy birthday. Thanks for your service. For anyone who doesn’t know, Tracey has a film/documentary about her life as a junkie. Good watch! That’s incredible keep it up��Congratulations! You are a miracle! Wow just wowCongratulations honestly huge accomplishment. Also everything you do for harm reduction is awesome. Youre an angel Tracey, God blessThat ice cream looks delicious!Congratulations!!Hell yeah, Tracey! I love your instagram and your commitment to harm reduction and education are truly inspiring.

You’re an inspiration to all of us!thanks for everything traci!You're an inspiration, Tracey. Really hope to follow in your path one day. Whenever I despair over quitting I'll remind myself that you detoxed without any fancy support by yourself and how you're the living, breathing proof that longterm recovery is possible. Thanks for spreading all that positivity and congratulations on 21 years of doing the nigh impossible! �❤️Very grateful to share this earth with you. Congrats on the achievement and thanks for everything you do. ❤️What’s your opinion on using cannabis to quit? Can you still be “clean” if you smoke weed?Can u link the documentary you are in? I can't find itYour sobriety is now of drinking age, better watch out! Kidding, congrats, I can't even imagine what my life may look like in 5 years, let alone 21? Yeesh.No way!!! WE HAVE THE SAME CLEAN DATE! Today I'm celebrating 1 year!Ahh, sticking to barbiturates. I like your style!Congratulations! I know you've been on tv before, but did you happen to be in a documentary around the time the picture on the left was taken? I watched one on youtube awhile ago and the image on the left looks like a person that was on it. Just wondering!That’s beyond awesome!! How did you do detox? I’m in a similar boat to you 21 years ago, and I need and want off!  I just can’t seem to do it.. congrats again, and dm me if you have the opportunity, I’m looking for anything to get me to the better side.. Thank you!Girl you should be in charge of your cities harm reduction.  Ive never come across anyone more dedicated at helping people, really helping people with no hidden agenda to inflate your ego or self worth. I'm half way round the world from you and am involved in harm reduction in my city by being a therapist for teen addicts, and almost everyone on the team knows about your story.

Just want to let you know you're being a worldwide inspiration.  Keep it up.Congrats Mama! Thank you for all of your dedication and hard work...you are a the best! you look exactly like the chick from the black tat heroin documentary unless you are her...Awesome. Loved the book and your interview on the dopey podcast. Congrats. [deleted]Congrats!!!you look soooo good!  looking forward to your book, keep us posted Wow. Big props to you! I’ve very proud of you. Your an icon for all of us that are clean or trying to get clean. Thank you so much for your post I've seen the doc you were in on YouTube- it was moving. Thank you for sharing your hope - recovering heroin & crack addict- 5.5 yrs clean. Congrats girl[deleted]You’re amazing!!!Wow so amazing! Congrats! Be proud!Congratulations! 37 days. I’m bored.Holy shit! Congratulations. I remember seeing you in an opiate documentary a few years back, and was so sad to hear that you had continued to use after the doc ended. Your story was really impactful to me at the time. I hope you are doing well. Much love ❤️ Way to go!Tracy, you are killing it! Thank you for all that you are/do! Xx.You in the rooms?? You know, the rooms where one says "clean" rather than "sober"?? 

Would love to meet you. Shoot me a message if you're ever in the central valley to chair a meeting =] 

I know I can watch a documentary about you, but there's nothing like hearing such a powerful message right from the addict's mouth. 

I remember you from that HBO doc. That's amazing !  Keep on Keeping on!Badass! Good on ya, broCongrats Thanks for all you do!Fuck yeah Tracey. You give us all hope.you are fucking awesomeStr8 off the set of MomThank you Tracy :)[deleted]Your a legend Tracy, congrats from AustraliaMaking a life-changing decision requires enormous amount of strength and braveness. You must be one proud lady.  
By the way, bon appétit with this charmingly delicious looking ice cream!Congratulations!!! ���Amazing!!METH?  3% success rate.  Do you still get cravings?Congratulations that’s amazing!!Omg I hope you’re super proud of yourself, you should be ! It’s good to see people do it :) Congratulations Tracey, it is a huge accomplishment!! Thank you for all you do for our community, you truly are a lifesaver !! I’ve done that method, and it did work, I also stayed clean for a few years after, my situation is going on 6 months now, the last two being a continuous “I’m not going to touch that shit again” and the longest I’ve gone is close to 48hours... 

Anyway, congrats on having a life, and keeping that shit out of yours! I hope I’ve shot my last shot, I was planning on it this week, I made it until today, and the vomiting and physical weakness decided it was going to let me mindfuck myself into using today so I can take care of my responsibilities. 

My apologies to the community that could have done without my “poor me” I can’t quit shit.. I know this post is about the strong woman, who hasn’t picked back up, like my dumbass..You truly are an inspiration and a saint for all you do. EDIT- you also look GREAT!I'm sorry for your loss.  Ow is addicted to ice cream and Reddit. Better than H and meth tho! Good jobThanks to you answering my messages I obtained the narcan that ultimately saved my life and I am heading to rehab for the first and hopefully only time in the next week. Thanks for all that you do![deleted]Congrats homie!! ���An amazing feat, for an amazing woman!! Congratulations Tracy!!! ❤️Congrats!!Dark end of the streetSo fucking amazing Tracey! I am so happy for you. Thank you for all you have done for the members here, and addicts in general. Your story really is an inspiration! I knew as soon as I read that headline it was you!!!!
Congratu-fucking-lations�❤️���⭐��️��️✔️I have followed your story for a while, since I first saw the doc,  and then opiophila, and on to reddit. 21 years is incredible. Takes a ton of strength. Congrats and wish you all the best moving forward I remember you from the BTH documentary, glad to see you're still around :)I read your book in prison just a great memoir thank you so much!TRACEY what a fuckin success story you are. I love everything you do for this community. You are seriously the best kind of recovered addict. I hope you continue to inspire and touch people's lives, and get more people well. 

Thanks to you, and reading your story, I decided it was time to do Suboxone maintenance. I'm proud to say I've been on suboxone for over 4 years now, and my taper will end soon (down to 1mg a day!). I continue to look to you as a source of inspiration. 

Thank you, Tracey. On behalf of the community.I'm 21 and you're an example since I discovered that you're alive after the documentary. Hope you're feeling well and thanks for your help in the community.WOO HOO ��‍♀️��
You rock!!!!Mad respect Lucky DUCK.......PRAY FORM__Congratulations!! That's almost my whole life, but again congrats, it's really an achievement!  You really spread some hope in the world. I hope someday to be able to get my hands on your "The Big Fix: Hope After Heroin".. Here in Italy I really struggled some time ago to find it, thinking now about buying it in english on Amazon... This is what I and other addicts in recovery wish and strive for. Congratulations to the max This brought me a lot of joy. Dark end of the street is a favorite of mine, seen it so many times. Its just too real, so happy you got your life back when you did.Wow! I have been sober for almost 3 years now, but this is motivation and proof it is possible to change your destiny! :) Thank you for sharing!Congratulations Tracy. You have been a great inspiration to me and my wife. We now have 16 Months clean time after 15 years of heavy use. Without people like you and our maintenance program we never would be where we are today.  We are finally getting custody of our 4 year old daughter and have our own apartment and the trust and support of our family again. Huge congratulations are due. And huge thanks too, for everything you do for harm reduction online and offline. Amazing willpower! Great work, ma'am! Because of you, I ate a pint of Haagen-Dazs mint chip ice cream last night.

I mean, there's some addictions you just don't get over.i make a point to carry spare fresh rigs and narcan, but im not sure what else i can do. Any tips?Ur truly an inspiration to us all. I totally recall seeing you in the HBO doc. Come such a long way congratulations!!! I have been working on it myself but I seem to get 6 months an then break back to bad habbits. Hopefully I'll get it right one day sooner then laterCongrats traceyh. And hi from a follower on twitter :)Congrats!! ���  and to many more years! Were you in a documentary about addiction? 

Edit: never mind. Should have read the thread before postingI remember seeing you in that BTH documentary before seeing you on here. Kind of surreal.[deleted][deleted]Thanks. That’s rad!THAnk you � Thank you ❤️❤️❤️Wait who dis? He the one who send out narcan? Thank you A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

Thank you Thank you !!!I was ❤️Here I am :)Cause she loves usI do harm Reduction services here and since I’ve been doing OD Prevention for 20 years, opioids don’t bother me. I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week Harm reduction.why not?To give advice and share the experience of overcoming addiction? Maybe?
Idk if you are genuinely worried that this may be a trigger for hrr, or just being a jerk.Do some research on her. She's pretty much a harm reduction legend, on and offline. The name is Tracey Mitchell Helton (hope I didn't misremember sth here) and she's mainly known for her appearance in the HBO documentary black tar heroin the dark end of the street in the 90s and has written books on the subject. Can only recommend the documentary, I've seen it more times than I can count. One of the best drug documentaries out there. ;) Why not?Shes an inspiration and it motivates people. If you've seen the documentary back in the day you'd know if she can do it any of us can do it.I've been clean for 16 months. I like to come here because this is where people need the most help and support.Dumbest question of the month award.It's a she, but yeah, she did that amongst other things. Shh!Bad botBad bot. This bot is dumb as hellTy Tracie. Drug policies should be legislated with people like you, and fuck off the pharma lobbies, but money, I know.
Thank you again.What clicked the last time? I sort of know myself and know I’ll always want to chip and think I can without getting a habitTy internet stranger.
 In this sub I find more support and compassion than IRL.
Your words had really made my day. 
Thank you so much.Gosh i hope youre right, im coming up on 3 years and i still struggle with cravings pretty regularly... I was clean for a year and 3 months off benzos and heavy heroin use, do you think my brain will reset back to noraml, because as the time went on iT was getting worse and after year i thought things would be good again. I ended up getting back on my medication for my My depression an anxiety. IF you dont mind me asking, do you take any medications? Crazy to be talking to you! Probably in my top films of all timeAwesome! Seriously shit aint easy. I beat opiates and alcohol and now coming off benzos. I can only imagine all four for that long. Not many can do it and it is no small victory for anyone, it is huge! Have fun !!!!Yeah I've seized off them before sadly because I was a dumbass lol; I'm prescribed them now thankfully but the xanax here is all still pressed pills so I gotta quit when I can before I get fent. 

Thanks for the response, you're a real lifesaver and this community is blessed by someone offering harm reduction, gives me motivation to stay off opiates seeing what you've done! 

Also, I live in an area with needles/cookers/cotton all available at the pharmacy no questions asked so if you ever run out of supplies or something for the kits I've seen you send out feel free to message me and I'll do what I can to help; just wanted to throw that out there.Yea i know... All because this dude didnt wanna have to go do a little time for a possession charge and be dopesick so instead he sets me up, house gets raided by swat and i get caught up with 7 oz of coke half oz of heroin lsd mdma and 40 plants.It’s on YouTube. I forget the name but if I remember right it’s filmed in San Francisco. Sorry I haven’t seen it in a few years Haha thanks, I will, but it's all the more reason to pull through given it's possible to do it cold turkey. ;D tho usually I relapsed in less than 48hrs, despite meds and even ibogaine once lmao. 



Anyways, happy celebrations if you celebrate this day! :3Thank you �Word, thank u. And yeah, 90 days on March 5th, suboxone and low dose klonopin only.Were ludes really all they are made out to be it is that just nostalgia?You look fabulous btw. what was it lik3 banging dope back in the day. im sure it was alot harder to score without cellphones lol. and you know where any of the other in the documentary are . dead alive or still using. clean?!?!? thanks ispiring story. was a good watch :)Whoa I was talking about your older interview. That’s so crazy that your tonight’s guest too. I’m listening now. That’s soooooo crazy lol. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dopey-dark-comedy-drug-addiction-heroin-cocaine-meth/id1077823917?mt=2&i=1000418919114
That’s amazing. Hopefully you’ll inspire someone to get clean. Keep up the good work Hey, I checked out the documentary. I started hanging out in SF shooting dope in 1998. I posted a link in the private sub to an article w an interview w my running buddy out there. 

21 years is fucking great. I had 13 years and fucked up, but I'm back on the suboxone now. Anyways, congrats again, keep on rocking in the free world!Thank you , after many of nights spent shivering in a hot bath barley holding my head above water and shitting and puking my soul out I'm a hell of a lot better , first time sober in almost 15 yearsThere’s other things?Lol to be fair I was stoned when I watched it. Regardless, glad you’re doing well:)[deleted]I cant believe you take the time to reply to everyone!! i saw you the "Black tar heroin: dark end of the street" many years ago when i was in the peak of my substance use; I really identified with you.

I really wanna say its amazing how you've not only turned yourself around, but have given so much back to those of us still afflicted. Your an inspiration; i hope to give back myself when i get clean (and i will one day)Understood... I was totally kidding if that didn't come through on my previous comment �Same mamaYou are so welcome dear. You really truly deserve it. You do so many amazing things for other people. I always find it hard to describe how I truly feel when I am overly passionate about something and I am very passionate about how I feel about your work.
Whew.... I wish that was the case for me. My mom bought it off amazon and mailed it in but nonetheless. Great read. I love your view on people staying off dope via suboxone. It really hit home and I couldn't agree more. Thanks for everything Tracey!See, that’s all I was asking, thank you. I hope I didn’t come off as rude, as everyone else took it. 
>I live in a place where I see ppl shooting up 5 days a week 

Wow only 5 days a week? Are the junkies in s.f taking weekends off now? Very progressive! 

/s orry couldn't help myself....[deleted][deleted]Oh shit my bad I’m sorry Sometimes it actually corrects someone who misspelled it... But for real. Why do we have a bot for a misspelling or a typo?They don’t even let me in the room :( I was just worn out and planning to die so it was easy to try new things 3-4 years the cravings died off for me Hey, good job!! Don’t know if you still need but the best way to go is naturally and just get some type of craft. Or try smoking CBD it really saved me when I was going insane with coke Mine too strangely enough I’m glad Harm Reduction is widely available there Thanks. I think I found it. Sure. Congrats :) I only took 1/2 and I’ve nevef been fucked up like that �������Google my blog “black tar heroin:10 questions answered”. No cell phones- just pagers. And the dope wasn’t as strong Congrats to you Wow how does it feel Allegedly I was high when I made it Oh no I love compliments- no sarcasm there. After you get to be 40, the validation dries up �You can give back now. Don’t let drug use stand in the way of your dreams. There are plenty of ways we can all contribute ���Tracey's a staple of this sub. If you havent already, watch that old HBO doc called Black Tar heroin, its in SF in I think the late 90s if you wanna see where she's coming from. Like in a very intimate way, almost to the point that I feel weird recommending it. But I think it's many of our favorite doc about junkie living.She had saved so many lives here by sending Narcan. Truly a blessing she is here. I once sent her a message in a dark time, I believe I asked something along the lines is recovery truly possible? She sent back something inspiring! I’m almost 2 years clean now. Life is lovely. I still hang around to remember how things used to be and sometimes chime in with info. I’m sorry you got downvoted so much. I don’t leave the house on the weekends- depression naps...I've been clean for like 4 years or so ( besides taking something like once or twice a year) and I just like looking sometimes.

Or maybe there is people in comment sections or posts that are looking for advice or help and she is trying to help in any way she can given her experiencesI get what you are saying. I used to come for the company, but ultimately it is what forced me to take a good look at myself. I come back to see how everyone is doing, and remind myself why I quit. Because being in active addiction is not a requirement for participating here. Anyone with honest curiosity, recovering addicts, relatives of someone in the struggle is welcome. We share our experiences, our victories and defeats, our happy moments, and our grief.There are a lot (A LOT) of people here who either don't use anymore or never have. I think the downvotes are just because that's common knowledge here. Even though, you have done so much!I bet....keep up the good fight. You have saved so many lives....including this one. You are an inspiration and the reason I found Reddit and this sub. That’s funny congrats! Do you have an interview or AMA talking about your experience with those times and the film? I feel like I heard about something like that. tha k u tracey . any complications from iv dope by the wayLol thanks. 90 days is pretty pathetic compared w the 13 YEARS I had, but I'm trying not to beat myself up. My midlife crisis kinda knocked me for a loop...[deleted][deleted]I'm old enough in this sub when i remember her showing up. We shot the shit in the old IRC back when i was active and living in boston all strung out. Sent her collarbone pics hah. She's a saint of the damned and has touched so many fucking lives. She knows more about my shit than most friends and all my family.There’s a few on Reddit somewhere She has a blogyou didnt answer the questions about the others status but thats okay. have a good 1 traceyI’ve had 34 abscesses and I had Hepc but im cured now My mid life crisis involved crippling depression Absolutely. My crotch was on fire the first few months I’ve only gotten better with age Was it because back then you didnt know the dangers of reusing dirty needles and not wiping alcohol and overall just goos hygeine when shooting (for the abcesses) and for the hep C was that because everyone was unaware that sharing needles passed on hep c and other diseases? thank you for answering allcmy questions. sorry im so curious ofnwhat it was like to live back then bring a junkie like myselfNo one knew about Hep C then. It wasn’t even called hep C. It was non A non B crazy did you guys know about endo and blood infections. you guys probaly necwr wiped with alcohol and practice safr injection. u guys were savagesWe did but the main thing we were worried about was HIV because there were no meds at the time  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: lol, Content: , ups: 1261, downs: 0Hmm surely they wouldn't cut my £0.30 Xanax pills with a dangerous drug...[deleted]Not the worst meme OP. Plot twist, Xans weren't laced, still died due to mixing Opi's and Benzo'sLmao will that really save u if the nanny is cut with fentyHahahahahahahahahahahaaaaummmm.....of course....xan + sub = full respiratory depression...Bupe can't block fent.  lolLol this should be on r/drugscirclejerkfuuuckAfter my last surgery they had to give me fent where I’d been on sub but I could be wrong Accept there is something called binding affinity and compounds with a higher binding affinity can dislodge others. Sub has a higher binding affinity than naloxone so it dislodges it making it useless. Fentanyl, has one of the highest binding affinities of any opioid and dislodges bupe and naloxone. To a degree an extreme amount of naloxone can offset this but in reality if there is any significant dose of fentanyl present you will need a compound called methylnaltrexone...

Psst and you dumbasses think you’re a scientist? 

Btw the term would be pharmacologist 

Either way you’re not it It's a sad fuckin' situation that people have to worry about black-market benzo's are cut with fent!!!  Sad but true.This had me rolling ����Wish i could get subs, but if i went to a doc for it my neuro would for sure cut my script for epilepsy and then the fuck if id be able to drive. And after that is one buttery ass slippery slope.If it’s strong enough, it’ll overpower the buprenorphine. Be careful with fentanyl. Perfect pic to go wit itI remember when I got off fentanyl/fent analogue I had to take 16 mg of subs to relieve the dope sickness and even then, I was just functionable, not high. However, more recently I got off BTH and I took 4mg of suboxone and definitely was a bit high, was a pleasant suprise. Now I am taking 1-2mg a day and while I don't get a traditional "opiate high" i get a definite mood boast and energetic which I enjoy. Never saw black market benzos, they are otc here...do even xans get cut with fent these days? that a thing?Is this why I’m seeing a decrease in demand for xannies on the street? People are really worried about product being cut with fent. Or is the hype surrounding Lil Xan blowing it out of proportion?The accuracy �Back to formulaBupe can help reverse an opiate overdose, but bupe in your system or not, if 5mg of fent Could kill you, and you ingest 5mg of fent, you're out for the count. You're still adding opiates on top of opiatesXanax pills cut? Isn't that like the benefit of pills, it's sort of easy to tell if it's been fucked with? Are these people crushing the bills, cutting shit in, and then repressing them? Wtf?

Man people downvote you hard for not knowing Xanax facts[deleted]Yes especially since the science doesn’t make perfect sense. Like ya there’s less per receptor activity, and less overall, but if there’s nothin in the xan...you’ve just taken opis for no reason. Subs are opis obviously even if they’re weak. If they want an antagonist, go get naloxone there’s a plethora. 

That’d be more “pure” for this purpose. 
And more effective. Tho bupe does have higher binding affinity than fent so thatd help a bit but I don’t think that the person who made the meme considered all variables and neuro pharmacological effects. 
So much on here is like, really da!!!!Sadly the only comment that mention the dangers of mixing Xanax and bupe.“the nanny” lol It can't? Really? Link, please.  Not challenging you. Just curious.  Thanks.??? It can. It has a higher binding affinity. It won’t block entirely but it would help. The only issue is few molecules of drug need to bind for a high level of affect in fents case. But it would help. Naloxone would be more effective but also bupe has higher binding affinity than fent while naloxone has equivalent binding affinity roughly speaking. 

- have actually used bupe to reverse a fent overdose more than once but I theoretically knew it would work or I wouldn’t have tried it... on myself first back in the day, then others. 

when I first learned about this in neuroscience and pharmacology classes I thought it might work but it took me a few years to prove because people don’t overdose in front of me all that often, from fent specifically. Got my chance tho. I always thought this info should be dispersed as harm reduction . I believe fent is 1 of 3 drugs w a higher binding affinity to the mu receptor....oxymorphone being anotherYes it can..Yeah it unfortunately has become a thing and a legitimate concern when sourcing black market pharmaceutical benzos. It is crazy but yes  people are insanely pressing whats marketed aa 2mg   xanax bars that in actuality contain fent not if you have enough narcan. i od'd on 3 mg of fentanyl hcl and was not on suboxone at the time, with pressed roxy pills and needed 2 doses of narcan nasal to life.A large percentage of street Xanax is pressed even if fent isn't in it, a plethora of other things could be. My friend died from coke cut with fent


I thought like u thinking before that. Now I just have a head scratcher 

They shouldn’t be but I guess some people are fucking stupid Lil Peep died from a fent pressed Xan. It makes sense, the bupe blocks the fent.


I would've died every time I was banging straight fent if it weren't for all the bupe still in my system.They aren’t really weak, they just aren’t as euphoric. An 8mg sub would floor someone who doesn’t ever take opiates, IMO. They’d be having a bad time. 

But also fent will push through subs, so this meme doesn’t make sense. Why would a Xanax have fentanyl in it?[deleted]That's what Casey Anthony referred to Xanax as. Xanny the Nanny. Gave that shit to her kid so she could party instead of parent.I think he meant that fent will almost always break thru the bupeYeah I’ve never used bup to treat OD. But I have used suboxone (1-3mg) in the morning then went and got high. I did the same amount of not more than my friend who had a large habit (gram-ish/day). He OD’d and I didn’t. I got plenty high but was completely fine and not close to OD. My boy ended up ODing and needed 6mg of narc to comeback. After his urine test he found out the dope was mainly fent. At the time I had no dope habit at all just was on 1-3mg of sub a day.

I know it’s a different situation but still feel like this example holds some value to the topic. I’ve also heard similar stories of bup reversing OD from heroin (probably fent mixed). I wouldn’t recommend using suboxone to reverse an OD unless it’s life or death situation with no narcan or medical assistance available. What were you taking a pharmacology class for. I also got a degree in neuroscience but never needed to take pharmacology. It might of been an elective tho. Are you sure? I'm convinced that taking bupe after fent can reverse an OD/cause precipitated withdrawalsYeah. Dilaudid is one of the few opioids besides fent that binds more strongly than bupe. 

I was looking for a good source to provide for people but it was surprisingly hard to find.Look it up. Google or something.Weird. It's been a while but I only ever got bars and I feel like I'd know the difference. Shit I remember another reddit user said he got his bars he bought tested and they had some wack cannabinoid in them. You never know nowadays Wow I wonder why they would even cut coke with fent. Was it an accident? Was it like a laboratory making both chems and one got mixed in, a careless dealer moving both? More likely part B.

I’m unmoved personally. I think all drugs should be legal and take Xanax for diagnosed anxiety. If people are buying bars on the street uninformed as fuck, it’s their own fault when they get a bunch of crappy fake BS. When I buy on the street i know the risk and accept responsibility for any consequences I might endure as a result of my bad, fun choice. I have a friend who is now dead because he took three bars laced with fentanyl. Motherfucker was 24 years old. He was behaving like an idiot and lost his life. It makes me sad as fuck.

You guys got my comment all wrong. Playing with something that might have fent in it is like dicking around with a loaded gun, eventually something bad is going to happen. The idea that you’d be taking suboxone to counteract the effects of what might be in your fake pills is fucking stupid. I am not saying it doesn’t suck when these people die, it’s a god damn tragedy. If we quit the war on drugs and legalized narcotics this wouldn’t be a problem. But they are stupid. Anyone behaving like this is behaving like a fucking stupid idiot and is rolling dice with their life on the crap table. Street drugs are Russian Roulette these days. 

I mean I know the meme was just for fun but it’s kind of a morbid topic for anyone whose life has been touched with death as a result of the specter of fentanyl. It’s today’s mystery monster that pops up everywhere randomly killing innocent stoners. All I can think is, why? And the only answer I can come to is that drugs are illegal. Would solve so many problems it’s literally mind boggling.Nooe, he had alprazolam and fent and pxy in his system so a fake oxy 30 with fent is like 1000% more likelyI remember reading somewhere that one of his friends (I think mackned) had an oxy 30 that looked fake but gave it to peep instead of taking it. The bars were most likely real, the 30 was probably pressed I lied my first time in rehab  and said I was an opiate addict even tho I wasn't dependent and had no tolerance. 4 mg of bupe twice a day for the first 3 days combined with phenobarbital for benzo w/d had me so high that I blacked out the whole weekend 

The nurses had to keep checking on me because I was perpetually nodding. Definitely wasn't having a bad time lolPer receptor site relative to street drugs in terms of activity they are weak. Dose is relevant. But yeah I mean depolarization  requires more receptors filled per neuron  ... bupe on its own is even weaker ... it’s metabolite norbuprenorphine is more active but it’s conversion rate is low and has a ceiling effect so 

to simplify; weak, yes

That doesn’t mean people don’t get high af. People get high off codeine ffs. And I know it’s morph that’s active in that case but again ; ceiling effect due to conversion necessity Fake 


Pressed pill made in black market 

Some are so accurate they’re impossible to differentiate I know. Isn't fentanyl more expensive? I remember on the DNMs you could get massive bags of real alprazolam or whatever it is and/or pressed pills. I always assumed it was much easier and cheaper to make and/or smuggle that shit.

I know fentanyl is pretty cheap esp. given its potency, but honestly it just seems stupid to me. I guess it's just to meet a demand when you have no supply but killing mofos isn't good for business either.

Like when someone cuts fentanyl into coke. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE SAME HIGH?!? So why not just give people 100% baby laxative if you're fucking them over anyways? It'll take you 30 seconds to realize it isn't coke. Why risk the manslaughter charge?I agree, I’m annoying. I wouldn’t want people to think it actually works like that, and I guess I just am at a point of exasperation with internet pharmacy advice. 

Bwahahahaha. Best random fact I've heard all week.Lol, never knew that. She lives in just a bit south of me. She is always front and center for Trump protests here in Palm Beach.Not true. Buprenorphine has the highest affinity of any opioid around. If you take a full blocking dose of 24 mg nothing will break through. That’s exactly what I meant thank you for specifying I should have done but it slipped my mind:
When no other means of reversal is around, subs will suffice especially in pt’s that are not opiate naive. Subutex works too but suboxone is preferable due to antagonist component. 


it makes perfect sense that this works the way it does in your story. Theoretically, bupe occupied receptors protecting them from Fent binding, 

even though bupe, and metabolite norbuprenorphine especially, is  active....bupe contributes less per occupied receptor site to opening of ion channels, thus changing the voltage of the cell less, thus causing less overall depolarization/firing of the neuron, 

Also since bupe has a higher binding affinity (level of “attraction” to receptor... think of it like the strength of a magnet for simplicity) than fent it takes priority at the receptor site and prevents the more powerful molecules from occupying as many sites as they would’ve (like in your ODd friend)

Your friend took so many mg of naloxone to bring back because 1- fent only needs a few receptor bound for a potent effect thus lots of antagonist needed to bounce the few off 2- naloxone actually has a pretty similar binding affinity to fent. Bupe actually has a higher affinity which is why it can work better than naloxone in for fent. 3- dose is relevant but not the only factor clearly 


 ... as I said, per occupied receptor site compared to commonly abused drugs (even more disparity with fentanyl) 

Anyway I studied neuroscience and psych and was a junkie for ten years so this =my shit. I used to love combining 7yr worth of study at university with my life experience from my habit because I’d come up with life saving info like this without having tried it out in the field. It saved my life first, so I’d say it was pretty damn helpful. That guy I ODd in front of, if I hadn’t told him what to do, woulda dragged me into the street by the ankles otherwise. Dealers don’t want dead chicks in their house. Bupe has a higher binding affinity than diamorphine, so it can be used as to reverse a H OD, but I think naloxone is still better to use as it's a true antagonistSo, fent, oxymorphone, And hydromorphone Bars are what's being pressed. It just depends on the presser and how professional they are. A lot of presses are shitty and you can tell something's off, it's crumbly, chalky, tastes weird, breaks easy, etc, indicating that it's been pressed. Where as some more professional pressers with better pill presses can make some practically flawless presses that you really can't tell they're pressed at all without sending to energy control or something and seeing a higher dose than 2. I can only imagine they put fent into super stepped on coke or to cause an opiate wd and get them always coming back for moreWell he always had oxy in his system though, and he was taking bars in the video he uploaded the night he died, plus pretty sure they confirmed it was the bars?^^Either way I really wish he was still here.Isn't it already dangerous as hell to mix the two to begin with? Not saying it's not possible but if he got high quality presses its hard to OD on those alone. I've taken probably hundreds and never once OD'dWell I’ve seen people who are opiate naive take 8mg of bupe and throw up for two days, so that’s what I mean by having a bad time. it could be as simple as someone weighing out alprazolam and fent on the same scale without cleaning it, incidental cross-contamination.Didn’t find it annoyingBut your explanation was wrong because your scenario you laid out was wrong.


The situation is a pressed bar which definitely has some benzo in it, most likely 2-4 mg of alprazolam, but possibly cut with fentanyl.

Taking bupe prior to using fent truly DOES reduce risk of overdose, while still allowing the benzos to do their work.


I know how bupe and fent works, it's all I did for months and months.[deleted]Lol I heard it on Last Podcast on the LeftRegular fentanyl has a binding affinity to the u-opioid receptors of 0.39nM, bupe has a range of 0.21nM to 1.5nM. Fent can still bind even with suboxone in the system. Not even mentioning the fent analogues like 3-Methylfentanyl or carfentanil that can easily stay bound to receptors even with large doses of naloxone. Reply to your comment with Not True LOL. Fentanyl will break through with the right dose and it doesnt have to be ridiculously high eitherTell that to the me from 2 years ago who was breaking through his subs with fent-dope literally every other day lolYeah I don't think anybody I deal with is that sophisticated, although I suppose the guy above them could be. Never confirmed, and its enough that one of the oxies he takes is fake and hes gone. Its very ignorant to say the bars had the fentanyl, when clearly he was taking bars that contain real alp aswell. The most likely culprit has to be the oxy in that situationAs long as its all pharms and you know your limits, mixing benzos with opie is ay okay. I have mixed benzps, opies, gabapentin, ghb and alcohol recently on a night out and was fine because i know my tolerance and limits50/50 I guessMakes kinda sense though I don’t know what they say. Not if the buprenorphine is at a full blocking dose. The other guy posted affinity numbers but the only place I could find them was on Wikipedia, no academic sources. I was told by someone who works in the field that nothing can break through buprenorphine except for uncommon opioids like lofentanil and 3methylfentanyl as the guy said. Those are not really around at all save 3methyl in some eastern European countries. Estonia I believe. I feel like most Xanax is pressed now. I used to get a thousand bars at a time that were almost identical to pharma. I almost never come across real bars there more expensive and weaker than presses It’s everywhere.

I know because I've done it with fentanyl, as have other people on the internet.Nigga, i was prescribed 43.7mg (4 of the highest formulation Zubsolv)  of sub a DAY ... out of 155 patients i had the 3rd highest dose prescribed, and the top dude died after 3months so i graduated to the 2nd highest prescribed patient on a dose of suboxone in illinois... (so my doctor said, anyway.. i find that hard to believe personally, but then again 44mgs is retardedly unheard of and unnecessary) 

And guess what?
I still blasted right thru that shit with good ol’ street dergz ��Doesnt mean it is waaaaaayyyy mire likeky to be the fake oxy. If fent bars were really that big of a thing opioid addicts like me would fucking search for them for the sake of the fent. Atleast i would :DHaven’t heard that one either. Oh well. It’s just common sense that self reflection awareness and acceptance =beneficial I'm willing to bet you weren't on 24+mg of buprenorphine. At that level all the receptors are saturated and it's not possible. Until I see real evidence to the contrary I'm not going to change my belief on that. If you have anything academic that confirms what you're saying it would be interesting to me. I call bullshit. The ceiling dose is reached before 32 mg. No doctor who had any idea what he was doing would prescribe that much. But honestly, I really don't care. It's only impossible in theory, in practice you might not be absorbing as much bupe or your metabolism gets rid of the one and makes the other come out idk. In real life there's way more factors than a in vitro test. But technically you shouldn't be able to break through on a ceiling dose of bupe. I mean it’s usually a really small amount of Fent in them not enough to be economical for serious junkies but enough to fuck someone up who looking for xans, and if he was used to oxy, cuz I never heard him doing h, and he took a bunch of them like in the video, it could totally kill him. But yes fent is much much more common in presses opi pills.I think u/DonRobeo is going for the phrase "The first step towards getting better is admitting you actually have a problem."

I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it but for some reason I can't remember the exact wording either.was on 24 mg for 4 months. dont believe it if you want and i dont feel like looking up any studies if there are any im just telling you my experience. respect your opinion still though. chemicals compete for the receptors and the dose combined with the affinity the drug has for the receptor chooses which wins.I'm not sure one way or the other which of you is right - on the one hand, 24mg is a huge dose and it's easily believable that not even fent can break through it, but on the other hand people's responses and metabolism and biology are all different, and I've personally experienced breaking through 8mg just with heroin and not even with a large amount. Sure, I didn't get the full effects of the H, but I definitely have managed to get high a few hours after taking 8mg of subs, so I could also believe that with enough fent you could break through any dose of subs.

So I'm not sure who's right, but I just wanted to point out that it's not fair that you are holding /u/1inchslanger to a higher standard of proof then you are yourself providing for your argument. You are telling him that he has to link to and cite academic sources for his claim whilst your sources for your argument is "someone who works in the field". Dr. P******n, Champaigne, il - was narrowly defeated by like 50 votes when he ran for mayor (dudes got juice) - hes got an original bottle of OTC heroin from 1911 chillin in his office... he  also knew my uncle on a personal basis and told me i was one of the worst, most unique cases of addiction he’s seen in 15+ yrs of addiction practice - he was also the first dr in illinois to prescribe suboxone. And one of the first to prescribe methadone in a Maintenance capacity.

If you think im one of these little fuckin kids who thinks addiction is cool that goes around lying about shit to sound cool on this thread? Then I shouldn’t even be wasting my breath on you ; you’re of your depth, homeboy.

I try to remain humble, but i am the LAST person who would ever lie about my drug experiences - i have way too much respect for the chemical and the world that we all fell into to spread bullshit.

He used to basicaly admit to me that he had no intention of ever getting people off subs - there were people that had been coming for 7years that had never even gone down on a dose.

If you dont believe me, thats on you brother.And i hate to break it to you? But the majority addiction specialists don’t have the first clue as to what the fuck they do/prescribe.

I feel like he lowkey knew that i was hoarding these fuckin things - i would skip every other appt. basically letting him know “i dont nees subs this week, i’ll be back when its convenient for me”

I ws getting prescribed two BOXES of the generic every time i picked up my shit from the pharmacyUmm if there is enoguh fent in fake bars to get a noticeable effect even for non opi users there is CERTAINLY enough in it to make it economical for junkies. Trust me, atleast where i live in it would be much cheaper then buyng oxys etc and heroin is non existent here, if fent bars were commonly a thing every fucking junkie would be doing em here. Source: am a junkieits all subjective like you said everyone has a different experience. it could be that i need a higher dose to completely saturate my receptors. it could be that fentanyl is unique as an opioid (it is) and simply has strong enough affinity to displace buprenorphine depending on the dose. 

im currently tapering off and i was put under just recently with fentanyl and propofol to have my wisdom teeth removed, at a dose of 4 mg twice a week  skipping all the days inbetween but that proves nothing. i wish i was on 24 at the time of the surgery so i could have set in stone proof fentanyl can do such a thing at 24+ mgI wouldn't tell people the name of a doctor you've been to, that makes it very easy to identify you and can cause trouble for that doctor. Anyway, I believe you but I don't know why any doctor would ever do that, it's commonly accepted that past 32 mg all receptors are filled and any more bupe is just pissing out money. Read any prescribing guideline. Some docs still do it because they get money from the pharmaceutical company to bill the insuranceIt’s almost like addiction is a disease that they can only help you so much with� but yes let’s blame those idiot doctors because you made foolish decisions in your life which led to you being an addict. Fuck those doctors and opioid specialists amirite @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Ran into my old dealer yesterday, Content: This dude would front and front and front and front me, I'd always pay. He had good H and things went like this for a while until he ran out at some point.  This is five years and some months ago now, he hit me up, I'm dope sick as can be and he says, "want to go for a ride (to base)?  Hook it up". Yes!
He scoops me up, we drive the 40 minutes or so away and get to dude's house, he's got the H drawn up. I've never done it or seen it like that before  but I'm sick so tell him to hit me.
Literally I remember telling him I am totally fine, I want one more shot before we go and that's the last memory I have before waking up in the hospital.
Where we were is an old abandoned town where an airport use to be, literally just drug dealers live out there now and a good 30 minutes from a hospital. Dude could have just left me out there, thrown me down some abandoned street.
He took me to the hospital and when I woke up he was still there, he brought me home.
Well, five years later now I'm at a gas station with my almost two year old and I run into him. He has a two and a half year old, he's sober too, just bought a house. It's a really good feeling that we both made it but I'm telling you, dude has always been good to me and I'll never know why but it was kick ass to see him again!  Felt like it deserved a post, it's a pretty significant moment to me.
That's all guys 👌, ups: 1210, downs: 0Well this is just an all around, feel good story with a sense of warmth that has no business on this subreddit. You can either delete this post or quickly edit in you smoked H in his car in front of your kids and then stole his iPhone, at the vert least. Your choice.

seriously though good work, my ex-coke dealer just got out of jail and I avoid him like the fucking plagueHell yeah brother I have an oxy dealer that is exactly like that. He would front me hundreds of them because he knew I would pay up. Really cool fucking guy he is. Sadly he went away and I havent seen him in a few months. Once you build trust and buy alot really good dealers treat you pretty much like family. He would always call me his brother haha.Is your dealer the real life Junkie Jesus?and people say no good comes from h... We are all people. Thanks for writing this. A lot of people here need to see it. YEAH WELL MY DEALER WONT EVEN ANSWER HIS PHONE...  SO YEA.

Some guys get all the fuckin luck.[deleted]Great story! Thanks for brightening my day OPI’m gonna assume you’re a woman. If you were a dude he would pushed you out and said fuck off.lol this is heartwarming shitThat's as wholesome as r/opis can get! Thanks for sharing, this made me genuinely smile and hopeful that I'll cruise around with some future kids, too, sometime in the future. Nice dude! Maybe keep in touch with him if he has his affairs in order![deleted]Honestly thought it was gonna be a story about you getting jumped by your old dealer but no, it’s this beautiful fucking wholesome story. It makes me feel warm just reading it <3I love this story.It’s great to hear there are good people in the world especially when people think drug addicts are bad people That’s pretty badass !![deleted]❤️!! Lots of positivity your way Good story.  Surprisingly good ending for a story on this sub.  But sometimes I think people look at their time of addiction as a bad time.  Although it wasn't always a good thing, I look at it as a great learning experience.  I don't miss the wds, but I miss some of the enjoyable times I had during that period of my life.  Glad to hear yours had a good ending too, for you as well as him.So sweet LOL totally get it. I did overdose, get Narcan'd in the hospital, woke up so pissed off and stupid I ripped my IV's out of both of my arms and left the hospital though. So there's that.  Dealer went to jail for about a year for some meth bullshit and that was the last I heard of him until yesterday. I always use to jam my Korn CD when I'd run to his place and every time I hear those Korn songs I think about those times. My nostalgia lol.  Story still belongs here man, I relate to posts here"Avoid him like the fucking plague" You mean pick him up from jail hoping he'll knock some off you price for a 8 ball?You a funny guy Are we so depraved and absolutely devoid of feel\-goods?

I mean, I know I am...Feels like family too when you're living the life, heySomething to think about! Shit it might be him, he’s risen again after leaving the tomb from the opium farms in China. Piss on them hey. I am who I am because of my past with hThe first buddy I lost to drugs overdosed and was thrown out of the vehicle, had a stroke in a snowbank, life support for a few days and it took him out.  We are all people, true, but that could have easily been my story. Lots of thanks to my dealer���� lolOh I agree with you about straight edgers being fake. Some of the most shallow relationships I've ever experienced. I'm one year off of Subutex too, good job man and keep it up!   My active addiction I've felt things, (feelings, highs) stronger and more intense than I'll ever feel them again, it's a very important part of my life, good and bad. Love this subThanks man, thanks for reading!Yup Yup, right away. We caught up a little but, for five, ten minutes in line at the slowest gas station around.  Was real niceExactly what I've always thought. I've always thought well of him. The type of person you wish you would see again, in a better place in life. And thanks man, me too. So glad. I had a buddy who overdosed and his "friends" didn't want to get in any shit so they threw him out of the vehicle NEAR the hospital. He had a stroke outside in a snow bank and was on life support for a couple days, ultimately he didn't make it.  They were shooting speed freak and Suboxone, dirty drugs but that could have easily been me, thrown out of the vehicle.  Shit makes you wonder a lot and is why I proudly own where I've been in life. Lots of thanks owed to my old dealer though for sureThank you!  Same to you!I miss some of it too, a lot of it and definitely feel the same, it was a huge learning experience.  I remember one summer when I was living alone and it was beautiful outside and all I could do was shower and lay on the floor and feel bad that I couldn't bring my dog swimming or outside at all. I could hear the fireworks going off on the 4th of July, my family would come over to check on me and I was just a mess. That was the worst summer of my life, total waste and miserable.  Sends chills down my back. Addiction is such an intense thing. I'm glad your story had a good outcome too, my friend. Makes you appreciate a happy, peaceful life >hear those Korn songs

Only the albums up until Issues, I hope Yess Korn rocksWhat do you mean I'm a funny guy? Like I'm a clown? I'm here to amuse you? It really does and he really treated me like family and no matter how much I owed he always gave me more and never ever let me go to work sick or  be sick ever. He always delivered to me no matter where or what time it was too. One of the few good dealers around.I volunteer at a needle exchange, and used an overdose kit on a woman turning blue in our parking lot. It was my first time having to do that (opiates aren't my personal demons, but loved ones struggle) and it was terrifying. She was so mad at me! I know why, but getting yelled at sucks and I was already nervous and scared. 

Now anytime I see anyone being too still in their car in parking lots I check on them. Most of the time it is just tired employees, but I always think about that woman. Yes I agree. What I was getting at more was we are all people as in we all have the capacity to care and all the like, negative and positive.  I'm glad you are still here and able to share these stories with the community. :) now watch yiu r children have school together.  Haha you could both arrange the Halloween party and share old tales of runs past. 
That's real fucked up man.  There is no reason to do this.  I mean I understand you can catch a charge still in some states but I'd like to think I'd take that to save a life.For sure!   Really not into the Skrillex Korn stuff. Really like Brian Welch and listened to some of his other stuff, it's not bad at allEach Korn album (up to and including Issues) is amazingFinally. You got it. Username checks out....hey tommy!My last oxy dealer WAS my family and they fucked me out $250. Fuck you uncle tom and your lying ass daughter, though I am clean now thanks to that whole fiasco.my bf goes to work with me sometimes, especially if we don't round up money to score til last minute and he'll just chill in the car. i had to make him start parking in the back of the lot because people forever thought he was overdosed when he fell asleep (i work nights so he is often sleeping). irritating at times, but i'm glad so many people care enough to say something. God bless you for being there!Thanks man!   Lol about the kids, our luck they'll date!  Catch a charge for what?But that's when they were mainstream, so you're not very cool if you had no idea they existed before that.Well you lost $250 but you found out your uncle and cousin were scumbags and got clean! Not too bad of a trade off, at least in my eyes. Congrats dude!Wow thats fucked up.Taking an OD'd person to a hospital/authorities, I thinkI was like 10 years old when I got their self/titled album. made my parents buy it for meBack in my day, a guy stiffed me for a bill, and I was all angry, stomping around. My roommate said, "Look, you learned the content and quality of his character, and it only cost you $100. That's cheap." I had to pause, and admit he was right..
Anything with a parental warning label on it was a strict no-no in our household. Right up until I got to high school when I built a computer so I could get free music (dialup) and play counter strike 1.1 or 1.3, whichever the last version that allowed bunnyhopping. i saw them live a few times, first time i was in grade 6. that was a year after columbineI think 1.3 was the patch that took out bhopping. Ahh the good old days. Almost brings a tear to my eye.Or totem up and camp a corner.

Get someone high enough to glitch the map @@@@@@@@@@ Title: #NormalPeopleMatter, Content: , ups: 1170, downs: 0Heroin matters let’s make it legal twitter saves the world againthe accuracy100% agree with this but some of the other shit I’ve seen pisses me off too. I saw some 13yr old little fucked saying she should be “thrown in jail cause she’s a drug user And he doesn’t like it when people use drugs, people can find other ways to deal with problems” OH OK thanks for solving addiction before leaving middle school, why did no one else think of that! 

Also saw some news site bullshit talking about how her family tried to intervene a few weeks ago but it didn’t work (obv), and then basically say she overdosed for attention seeking....  like oh she’s famous and couldn’t possibly have the same issues as ALL OTHER ADDICTS, it must be an attention grab. Most addicts relapse after years sober just to get attention. 

The shitty trend of just wanting views/ likes/ whatever, not caring about truth or integrity, idk man it’s pathetic. And just knowing what it is to be an addict and like how shitty it would be to have people publishing and telling 10’s of thousands of people that you relapsed for attention like damn that is gunna help her for sure. Change takes a while. We butchered Britney in 2007 during her crisis - slowly things are changing imoYup...and they say addicts are the mental ones. Just stop listening to the bullshit and think logically for yourself. Yes, society is and always will be a confused bitch - much like your holy roller mother in law (who did every drug known to mankind back before she lost her memory about it all, has the same wild 80's hairdo with really damaged, bleached hair and can't shut up about everything you do and be gossiped about and belittled by a freaking crazy ass bitch that thinks ppl like "the Long island medium" are the most intelligent and that it could be true about the world being flat. Yup, "society" is a freakin bitch, my friends.I would think that such a high up celebrity OD would raise awareness and break down some of the stigma when dealing with it. demi did heroin fr?Too true SAVE DIACYTLMORPHINE!!! What I don't get is why people have to make this comparison. Most people don't hear about every normal person that overdoses because they're not public figures. The reason people care about this is because this is someone who has been very public about their struggle with sobriety. If anything this is baby steps towards the general public changing their opinions towards all drug addicts. 

Wish we could all just wish her well and a safe recovery instead of comparing her to other people. I saw something today that said "wish people had this same energy when it came to Whitney Houston". Never even thought about that but it's true. Many People don't care unless it's someone they idolize. 

Regardless, I do hope something good can come out of her od. Maybe it'll open people's eyes to the fact that addiction doesn't discriminate. 

also people bashed peep I feel like I tell exactly this to people daily since she OD'd. People always give me shit for it. It's a dumbass world we live in folks. LolWell I for one haven't contributed much to society. Used up way more taxes than I've paid. Healthcare is free here but it's still something relevant to people in the US If I could upvote this several times I oudl#truthNailed it.It's sad society looks at us, as if we are a waste of life. I saw a thread a few months ago about how opiate addicts shouldn't be allowed to get methadone.  It's just disappointing to hear people say we deserve to feel sick, and if we die "we deserved it"
Like. Our lives don't matter since we are addicted.. �She didnt even OD on H, she OD'd on an opiate but not heroin[removed]#SaveTheHeroinlegalize recreational heroinLmao yeah, what a straw man argument. As if you can lump everyone in the world into one category.“People can find other ways to deal with problems” 

*Drug use drops to 0%* 
Wow thanks kid, you just ended drug addiction bless you Leave Britney alone. that was the biggest scandal of my childhood lmao


but yeah i’ve met a lot of ppl now who are supportive rather than judgmentalAt least Britney had the decency to show her monkey though. I can fuckin relate to this, bro!You mean the same way Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s OD really changed things right?LolIt's just pointing out the double standard people have, if the average person hears about someone loosely attached to their social circle ODing they judge them negatively. If it's a celebrity they show empathy.I think its less of a comparison and more of an awareness to treat the people around us physically better. It's not that most people dont hear about the average person ODing, it's the friends or family or acquaintances that everyday people see pass away and trash their legacy. 


They get on social media and bash the person as a lowlife degenerate and their families read this filth. Yes a good percentage of addicts do bad things to support their habits, but a good percentage of the general population is fueled by greed and corruption to have more money than one can comfortably spend, all in the name of the quest for material things. Addicts, for the most part, do their immoral acts and illicit behaviors due to the pain and suffering of withdrawal. Physically feeling like death and mentally wishing for it. It's a rough fucking life nd yeah we tried drugs in the first place, for a multitude of reasons, but we never wished for this life. We wished for escape from pain, heartbreak, boredom, just the monotony of life.


It's what unites us all. Why are soo many average people bashed as hopeless losers even when we DO know their stories, ambitions, families, the good things they've done for people.. but famous people are immediately glorified and "victims." Yet I very rarely see any just average, normal everyday person projected as a victim. I think that's the question these posts are putting out there. Some have been down right mean and wrong to Demi.. but most are just telling people to be more empathetic to those "real" people that we know, love, or actually spend time with in our lives.


I wish nothing but the best for Demi, and I also do for anyone going through this struggle.I don't think that pointing out the hypocrisy in how the media & general public perceive and treat celebrity addicts vs regular addicts implicitly puts Demi Lovato down. I and I'm sure most of us hope she gets the help & treatment she needs and can relate to her far better than most, and I don't think anyone is pushing for or expects every addict that overdoses to be national news, it's just there is still an ever-present stigma associated with addicts (*especially* heroin addicts) - even the word 'junkie' is synonymous with scum and is spat at people in the same way one might say the word 'rapist' or 'rat' - and this vilification is lacking when it's a celebrity who is falling prey to addiction. 

Nobody is suggesting the solution to this is to not support Demi Lovato or to give every overdosing addict a spot on the evening news, but this provides an opportunity to discuss the opioid epidemic and with any luck Ms Lovato will use this attention and her significant influence to cast light on heroin addiction and keep eroding away the counterproductive & harmful stigma that seems to me to be present in the perception of heroin addicts to a much greater degree than practically any other addiction. 

That's all well and good but people that wouldnt normally not think twice about bashing a junkie actually have been looking up to one for years, that's a pretty big step as being seen as equal and getting help in society.Usually you won’t hear about someone’s overdose unless it kills them.  I think the point was that ALL people struggling with addiction should be wished well, not just celebrities.  And that’s not how it is.  No. Just no. People would say the same thing about a black/Asian/Aboriginal person as long as they were a celebrity. It’s called famous privilege. Please don’t be so quick to yell white privilege, especially if it straight up is not valid. Oh godNo. If this were Oprah people would be shocked to hear she had an issue (they’d allow her addiction to be categorized as a disease), and they’d be clicking likes and hearts to show their support, and sending out thoughts and prayers via social media. People would still want to see her be and do well. It’s because she’s famous. 

But your regular ass folk, be they white, Black, Asian, whatever...if you have a problem, you’re scum and stop giving fucking narcan and wasting money on them, let em die with the addiction they chose; it’s not a disease. 

Please don’t with that shit, ok? >straw man

Lots of people actually think that way, it's hardly something that Twitter user just came up with on the spot.The world is trying to move towards identity politics and it’s failing miserably. It’s one of the reasons Trump won. Ha. She is actually doing great now. In shape, dating a 22 year old, killing it in Vegas. She and Lindsay Lohan got little support. Though Lindsay hasn’t really come up from the bottom. My favorite actor, but he doesn't move the needle for the masses like Demi. Yea he’s not quite in the same demographic.Great post, I agree 100%. You're right in that when this happens to a celebrity, opinions seem to be really contrastingly divided between those who seize the opportunity to kick someone while they're down and vilify them and those who immediately craft the cliche "reckless out of control celebrity spirals downhill" narrative, simultaneously fetishising and glorifying their behaviour by paying so much attention to it whilst overtly appearing to maintain a position of disapproval. 

You also make a fantastic point about another difference between how celebrities vs normal addicts are treated - when celebrities develop a drug problem, it's not uncommon to see magazines, newspapers, talk shows etc to immediately ask why this has happened, try and trace it back to some career misstep or a relationship breakdown or the influence of another celebrity or a childhood trauma etc. In doing so, the media paint a clear picture of a person who is going through a drug problem.

Contrastingly, if a non-famous drug addict is in a position where they receive media attention like if they're related or in a relationship with a celebrity or they're involved or have witnessed a crime etc, they are just written off as a junkie or a drug addict. Whilst the celebrity is a person who is going through a drug problem, the normal addict is just a drug addict/junkie, as if that is their whole identity and they are the embodiment of a drug addict - no need to ask why the person is a drug addict, that would be like asking why a person has blue eyes, that is just who they are. 

This attitude isn't just limited to the media, but I have found it to be the opinion shared by the majority of people, especially those who don't take any illegal drugs themselves. In branding someone a junkie you simultaneously strip them of their humanity and reduce them to their biggest problem and their worst struggle, and it must be difficult for someone to quit when all those around them no longer see past their drug problem at the person behind it all - why quit when everyone sees you as nothing more than a junke anyway? Well said, at least you see why ppl are mad and sad. I just read on tmz that she turned down help weeks ago from ppl around her...i wish some of my dead friends could of had that chance to get clean but they didn't have enough money to get good help. They was lucky if detox took them for 72 hours. And. Then it was oh okay, get out back to the street. Unless you have money for a rehab or halfway house because we have no beds left for youNailed it :)But the opiate epidemic is being treated very differently than the crack epidemic of the 80s that was destroying mostly black neighborhoods. People now care when it’s their suburban children that are getting strung out. I agree with you partly!!! I think it's both and will continue to think it I didn't see people I feel sorry for Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. But instead they made jokes. And look what happen to that family...I stand behind what i said.I agree. But I also think that things are no longer race related more so rich vs poor. Poor whites are looked down on just as much as ghetto blacks. 

The opiate epidemic is truely being treated different than the crack opiate of the 80s. The fact is that this epidemic is effecting people from suburban communities compared to cracks effects on mainly poor urban black. I’m just saying it’d make more sense if they chose a specific person. There’s a lot of compassion for addicts these days, and there’s been a lot of mean spirited Demi memes. There’s assholes and good people in every cross section of society.Hasn’t she? I thought she was laying low in the UAE, opening up spas and shit, and doing well? Fucking bingo. People just look at us with an entirely different mindset. As soon as your junkie secret is out that's it. Unless you're uncomfortably vocal about you're recovery , even if you do get clean its still the same:  untrustworthy, will steal any chance they get, liars, definitely never give cash and always be suspicious of the addict.


Its frustrating talking to so many people: at work, loved ones, etc., and especially those that have never touched anything but some pot, talk so down about addicts. My secret is still hidden but that door is unlocked and opens a little more each month so I still hear their real opinions, shit they wouldnt say to an addict even. Just really makes me so sad to be honest. Why hate an entire group of suffering people- the majority nowadays are good hardworking people that must hide their shame.Exactly, i said the same thing...I've seen it all my life living in the hood Most people who hate junkies would hate all junkies, of every race, equally. Please explain to me how this is white privilege? Bingo. But some ppl will never see it that way, maybe because it didn't happen to ppl they knew.  idk but it's selfish and a shame imoWell her career is over cause its too expensive for Hollywood studios to insure her (you have to get insurance for every big budget film) but to me she seems in a place where she is happy and has a lot of successful business ventures. She also said she used ayahuasca to get permanently sober. Doesnt seem like her "bottom" to me, just a different outcome than she and other people wanted.i haven’t seen her in any movies lately tho

she was in machete that was the last i saw of herI'm not here to explain my mind and things i choose to believe to ,you. Go look up the the past at how junkies were treated, compared to now...it's only like this now because it's white ppl who are strung out the most and not the ghetto population... if it was still majority the ghetto population you wouldn't hear anything about we need to get these people help. You say something like that you should be able to justify it, or least give some reasoning to your opinion. And junkies are starting to get treated better today because addiction has become know as a disease in medical professional rather than a behavioral disorder, however we are still in the transitional phase of this and it while Sounds like your mad at my opinion. Well that's just it, mine, not yours....i really don't understand why you think i need to justify something to you. I'm a grown man who has a backbone so, I'm not gonna just do what you think i should do to please you.  Are you trying to tell me what I'm allowed to think and say??? Please answer me that... Because you don't see me chastising you're thinking, I actually agreed with you on something and some things I didn't. But for the sake of your health you should really stop trying to put words in people's mouths and telling them what they should do and shouldn't do... that's almost the same thing as bullying somebody and people tend to frown upon that. so don't try to bully me little man I think he was just trying to get your reasoning behind your opinion. To better understand and then either have counter points or maybe concede on some things due to being able to understand your POV better. Kinda the point of the subreddit, discussing things with other people. Your deflections don’t really make it seem like your sitting on a whole bunch of good reasons for thinking thatIf you’re a “grown man with a backbone” you should be willing to stand up for your opinion and provide information behind your logic. To just say something and then defend it stubbornly by basically just saying “because I said so” you are acting like a child. I’m not necessarily mad at your opinion, I would just love to try and understand it. Your whole demeanor is so off putting dude; I wasnt getting aggressive with you, maybe frustrated, then you start calling me “little man”, dude you don’t fucking know me, I don’t know you, better not to make personal remarks just stick to the facts provided by the text. As a black man I am aware of white privilege, it just doesn’t apply to this post; like you admitted to another person here, all I asked was that you told me how it applied to this post, if you know it doesn’t; then say so, you fuckin clownI don't have a whole bunch of reasons.  Only a few...shit, i mean I'm a white drug user myself but i still see the white privilege thing happen all day. I could sit here and act like it doesn't happen all day long but it does, I might have been wrong in this situation to use that analogy. but trust me it definitely holds up in the real world...I'm don't mean to come off as bitter but why can't everyone get the same kind of help as everyone else, skin color or status, should not matter......but i already know I'm preaching to the choir here on getting ppl to change how they think about thing's so i won't even try.  But i bet more ppl will still try to change how i think.....i don't get humans Like i said in the previous post, it doesn't have anything to do with it. I even said it was wrong and out of context. But at the same time it's the same people who trash junkies that aren't rich and famous. That embraces the junkies who are famous and or rich...how come we don't ever make a big deal about Wayne oding on lean and having seizures?, but instead we hear about johnny minzal (or how ever you spell it) drinking all the time and needing help with it...look at when Lamar Odom oded and was in a coma for how ever long. The only ppl besides the Kardashians who gave any support & love is bb players and rappers. Why i just don't get it?  Aren't we all human beings who need empathy and love every once and a while?....oh and i don't mean to be off putting, i just have strong feelings toward it and it may come off as assholeish. But I felt you were try to order me in to giving you answers that frankly i don't have to do even if i was in the wrong or not. Because As a grown man i can say and do as i please, as can you, so why does it matter if i did really feel like this is white privilege or not?  I'm allowed to feel like that if i please aren't i ?  there you go talking shit again like i need to justify myself to some internet random or anybody for that matter.    If i was in front of you i would tell you the same thing. You can say I'm being childish and call me a clown all you like pimp, it doesn't bother me like it does you.   Stop thinking ppl owe you something and have to answer a question just because you ask them to.....little boy acting ass grown man go play in the sand box. And kick rocks with your needing an anwser ass...lol Nah b I 100% am with you on the fact that white privilege is way too real and prevalent and disgusting. I don’t think it applies to this comparison from the OP, but I really hope most people would admit that it’s a real thing. It would be incredibly naive to not acknowledge it. Also a kind of commentary about white privilege in and of itself lol 

Like I support you calling it out I try and do the same but I just don’t see it with the post here. And I’m not even saying you should change your opinion and I don’t think the other guy was either I think he just wanted to know why you thought it applied here idk tho can’t speak for them. 

Keep fighting the good fight tho homie Cool  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: No replacement, Content: , ups: 1161, downs: 0See your homeland, swing on the tire swing, look at the stars, roll in the grass, run with your dog, talk with friends (in person) in front of a raging camp fire. drink cheap beer, sing, dance if you like it, Play.

The problem here is that people think life is about having a job, a car, and a roof over your head.  
That's what society tells us, and in some ways that's what actually drives some of us to the drugs.  This tyranny of mundane normality is a façade.Got 2 years clean . I’d nvr be able to do it with out some type of high . Luckily weed has been enough for me so far Right in the feels. Man this sober shit be boring as fuck. I dont know how some people do it for real. Like Idk, ive been forced into getting sober and in the depths of what you would call addiction, tried rehab and everything else. Once I got out of legal trouble and able to have freedom,again I started using drugs again but I keep it way way more low-key and its been fine so far... Like I just need a chemical outlet to not go insanebruh life is boring afLearn to be sober not just with your actions, but in your thoughts too, both conscious and unconscious a like. This will be a daunting task, but after some time your efforts will result in a changed perspective. This will allow you to feel freer from the weight of addiction than you had  ever before dreamt possible. Find a place where you can make yourself uncomfortable yet maintain  your stability. Complacency is a slow cancer that can cause relapse albeit subtly. So, being able to mix things up while still maintaining can seem intimidating, but once you finally master this skill your spiritual and emotional growth will astound you. Proof that growth comes from learning while being uncomfortable. Take control of your mind, don’t allow yourself to be imprisoned by it. Like I said before with time and training, discipline, patience you will eventually learn how to combat those demons in a healthier manner ultimately giving you an overall better quality of life. Remember to keep the long game in the back of your mind for right now and focus on the present. Like the old adage goes, “one day at a time.” Just abstaining isn’t enough, you have to re-wire your brain. 

Edit: some words, thanks for the kind dm’s for anyone out there who is struggling with addiction I too love with that beast constantly crawling up my back so feel free to message me if you need a homie to talk too! I'm not an opioid user but I can relate in the sense that once you feel how great some of these drugs can make you feel, sober life just isn't the same.This is how everyone feels. But almost everyone agrees its better to the alternative. If you ever feel bored think about the reasons you stopped, all the fucked up shit you don't want to see yourself do again.This is literally how I feel everyday. I thought everything would be great once I attained these things, but still just feels shitty1 week sober and I don’t think I’m following the right path �Life isn't enough. I demand euphoriaWhy we must fight our oppressors Yup. 2 months sober and I feel exactly like that lil fish Congrats!!! It feels good doesn't it!!!I have acquired 1.5 of these in the last 15mos. Doing something wrong stillYep I just feel like I wasn't meant to live in this time period. Paleolithic era is where it's at living in nature and shit. Here is the deal, life has to have a purpose and meaning. There has to be an overarching plan or purpose to existing, or is simply base mechanics(eat, work, poop, pee, sleep) with varying distractions. This will become apparent once even hedonism becomes boring, and lol it will eventually.

&#x200B;

This purpose or meaning can be different for everyone, I have a kid I love. Shit I like to get buzzed and take him to the carnival or whatever, I actually like spending time with him.

&#x200B;

If it wasn't for that I'd probably have suicided by now with a big gram shot of fent, I just don't care otherwise.3 mo sober and I'm more lazy now than I ever was on drugsI think the key to the sober life is to have something you love to do.It gets better. You can always drop acid every once in a while lol.pretty close to how i feel, but i still use drugs..Why did you have to post this right before I plan to get clean :/LMAO! 

It’s called being a “dry drunk”. Thanks NA! ��Went 2,5 months sober, ‘relapsed’ a week ago. Had some fun a couple of days and now have to restrain from using some time to not get addicted. 
There is really nothing like Opioids.This is 100% me_irl. I cant get over the anhedonia and depression and then relapse. And for a small time there is color to my world again. And this is why I’m still a heavy poly drug user![deleted]Annnnnddddddd it's gone (south park voice) Sobriety blows I used to be in this boat but i basically feel like i did before using. Still on suboxone tho. Smoking weed really helps. If you're bored while sober, just try pursuing your lifes passion. You dont have to be a parent and wage slave to exist on earth. Do whatever the fuck you want. Well just a thought: how exciting is life on dope? Sure you feel good just sitting there, but you're not earning it. It sucks but I think we need to force ourselves to have fun the normal way.This is it.. Happiness is just molecules in brain Well yeah, I'd feel like shit too if my cubicle had no way to out without climbing over the neighboring ones. 

Nah, I know I'm taking that picture too literally. I get it; I think it's shitty that people who work in call center cubicles work to fund their car and insurance. They'd probably be happier on a lower paying job that was a block away from home if they didn't need the car for much else. A lot of the people I worked with didn't use the car for anything else but commuting to and from work as well as food shopping which is cheap enough to have delivered nowadays.


Some days I feel bleh and don't feel like I can get myself out of that pit, but I usually do. Still, I worry about how I'll feel when I taper off subs. Ok, so I totally do not get being bored in sobriety.

Can you list some stuff that upsets you specifically? 

There is so much stuff to be interested in, it is literally ridiculous. I mean, do you read about these incredible people jumping off mountains in wing suits, and you can actually tell me that life is boring? I want to do that!

Yes, most of us have to work for a living. It is a shame that we cannot play 24/7.  But there it is. Even working 8 hours a day, that still leaves a shitload of time to do fun stuff.

I absolutely do not understand this.  I was a hardcore IV junkie for 11 years, but am clean now. All I have to do to start having fun is literally step outside my front door. Because then I am going to start running into my neighbors and every one of them has a cool story to tell.

The old guys are all about life in the 50s and 60s, which was amazing. The younger guys talk about their sports and their game playing in the corporate world, which if you listen, is shockingly fun. And the girls. OMG the girls. A big smile. Hey what's up? Yeah, I love the neighborhood too. Really, you like (fill in the blank) music? So do I!

And it is off to the races.

The alternative? Well I guess I could hit a big shot of dope and go to sleep. Man, that is just soooo interesting.  Whoops, what do you mean it is 2019? You mean I missed the last five years? Damn, I don't remember them very well. Did I really do that?

Yes, I know, society sucks. Life is not fair. People are stupid. Yada Yada.

I don't think you are trying very hard.

Just my opinion.Add a little weed and therapy and it can get funI feel this man, up until this relapse I was feeling dreadful. I still feel guilty about relapsing, but that's mostly because my family thinks i'm done with the stuff, but that's a fat lie. I've relapsed like 8 times this year. I'm in an internal battle of making my family happy, or making myself happy. And I don't know how much longer I can do the former, I hate myself lately and oxy brings out my confidence and gives me happiness, even if it's artificial. I'll take any happiness I can get at this point.I think it has to do w the way our brains are wired in expectation of instant gratification.  Drugs are excellent choices as vehicles of delivering instant gratification.  When you get clean and are sober, most of the “great” or “exciting” things take TIME to build and develop. Being so used to instant gratification from drugs, the wait for such things to happen to us is “too long”, we get inpatient, and complain that sober living is “boring”.  

[deleted]Doing cardio to exhaustion as much as you can will boost your mood tremendously. Probably the last thing you want to do, but eventually you yearn for that dompamine dump. Better than any drug. Also a quality fish oil supplement in high doses (5 pills/day) will at least make you feel happy. Hope this is helpful. Hahahaha so true. Sigh.Why why why is it like this? How do people like tracey415 get 21 years but I can't even get 3 monthsIs like, you start being addict for some reason, you weren't a asshole, or not that asshole. When stop to taking drugs you have to front this shitty life, problems or feelings which made you take the decision to fucked up.Preach, year and a half sober for the most part. Well if you dont count drinking like a fish every night. Which by the way definitely comes no where close to some dope.Dude I fucking love this comment.This comment is perfection! Started using many different drugs because i can't stand the thought of just living a normal life, just having a prestigeous job, a wife with kids and house to full fill societies thoughts of a "normal" life. In the end, listening and dancing to music makes me truly happy. Sorry for my english it's not my native languageSo if I wander thru the woods alone tonight I’ll feel fulfilled?You got it. But you forgot the part where everything pushes one way where natural contentment and joy is usually another. i like the high i get when i do things like skateboarding, camping, swimming, skiing etc.  Cant stand pot anymore for some reason. Makes me self analyze too much I am sure you have probably thought of this already but is it possible that you are trying to self medicate for what may be underlying depression or anxiety?

I had a very difficult time quitting opiates because I was not being treated for depression. So as if kicking drugs weren't hard enough already,  the only thing I came back to was depression. Being medicated by a doctor for that issue made it much easier to feel okay without being on opiates.I'm in the same boat as you I don't like weed at all sadly, I just use it for sleep. Nothing will ever give me that same happiness as oxyI wish I could be like you. I used to smoke weed everyday and that would be my exit route if I were to stay clean. I want to be completely clean but my lungs went through a lot of damage from a pneumonia I caught where my body went into septic shock and was left for dead. Luckily I was given another chance at life but I keep feeling guilty from my drug use :/  That’s how I thought about it for a long time, but I realized I’d just be nodding off somewhere doing nothing. Sure, I’d feel good but I’d somehow be doing even less than I do sober. Fuckin mind games manI've always thought that the people that can get sober for good, never had much of an issue with drugs in the first place. Find something exciting, go be a smokejumper. Parachute into wildfires for a living... If you are bored I'm sure you hate your job but you can change that and will have to if you want to *really* get better.Your comment hit me right in the feels Dude I related to this so much. Like shit hit the fan and I went to rehab/halfway and worked the whole 12 steps and even sponsored 2 guys. Was sober for a while but now I just smoke weed everyday and pop a pill here and there but shit even when everything is going good it’s just so boring... The key is, switch your drugs, dont just use opiods.

One day you get drunk, then opiods, then lsd, then stims, so on[deleted]Golden advice You must blaze your own path, a job by definition is helping someone else achieve their dreams.Wat..?I was just talking to my mom about this. 
You’re absolutely right that **most** people *need* purpose in their life. For some reason it seems unnatural to not have it and it makes people depressed and hate themselves.
 
For some reason I’ve always flourished and never gotten bored of the hedonistic lifestyle. Doing nothing but what I want and having no drive to mean anything in the world has been just fine with me. 

It’s when I stop living the bum, party and drug fueled lifestyle that I get depressed. Even with purpose, like the many schools I went to, I just wanted to quit and get high instead ��‍♀️Very true, although the addiction recovery programs in my area do not address dual diagnosis.  Some people with mood disorders, for example, detox just sweats you through your DOC.  Then, the PROGRAM in my area is the 12 steps that says no meds at all and essentially genetic mental disorders are a character defect.

Sorry if I am bring up an old thread or replying in the wrong place.  Opiates, alcohol, uppers, whatever, if you are even in treatment for a serious mental disease that will never go away...add life stress....it is Very hard to not want to escape one’s existence.

My bro and I are ravaged by the same disease....I wonder daily if he is gone down the H rabbit hole forever.  I’m no innocent..  we both did programs,  he even delved in 12 step but could not make amends. That step. But that ... anyway thanks for reading.  Typing sober.  Psychedelics don't compare to hard drugs unfortunately plus they can be too anxiety inducing in some people, they aren't for everyone.gotta love NA.   I must be an obese slim guy  ���

Surely these NA guys who are 5+ years clean, spend 4 hours a day in meetings, yet "never think about drugs"  -  are straight up honest people too ���That’s how I hope to use in the future. 

1 month clean, binge for a day or two, then restart. Why are you getting downvoted? Its kinda messed up for drug users, ostracized for finding happiness in something considered "unnacceptable," to be ostracizing you for finding happiness in something they don't like. Kinda hypocritical, if you ask meHigher power as in God and shit like that? ... it’s not about the car ...You gotta get a decent job that you don't hate IMO if you want to stay clean.

No way could I have stuck out my old callcentre job while in WD's or clean, it was just a hateful place. Just like in the spongebob image. My current job on the other hand, I am not forced to get high to make it through a shift;  I ended up getting high after work as it was the long evenings where I got bored and wanted to get high. That's how I ended up getting hooked badly. I remember the first time I used during a work shift, I didn't really like it at first as I thought "damn people might notice"   (but in the past 5 or so years my tolerance was so high I appear completely 100% normal)Exercise is super cliche, but is legit the only somewhat “chemical” replacement for opiates and for depression In sober life. And I don’t mean light exercise I mean heavy runners high type. kids also certainly give you fulfillment and motivation. I didn’t read through every post but keep trying,  keep your head up, good luck! P.s methadone taper is a great way to eliminate cravings and ease into it and some people just stay on it!How do you drink like a fish every night while maintaining your sobriety lmaoTry baclofen, its like alcohol's suboxone.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaclofenForAlcoholism/)Thank you... Ive felt the way the meme describes as well, but only until I began to find real life again.  Not what they tell us life is.  your English was fine.  Thank you.  :-)This is almost the choose life speech Only if you do it in the nude.  :-p  

Im not sure what types of low cost worldly things u might like.  We are all different.  but the key thing is to try it after a few months of sobriety.
Yes. society wants us to be a certain way, and its hard to resist that.[deleted]I used to love skateboarding but the gym has been my high lately. I’m also 2 years off dope. 

What do you like to skate? I’ve always been into big gaps and stairs growing up but I really want to learn transition Same thing happened to me. I quit around age 21 cuz I kept thinking I wasn’t doing shit with my life. I felt guilty about things. I didn’t realize the reason I felt so unhappy when I’d smoke. I just knew it was amplifying my unhappiness. So I stopped for nearly a decade. I’m in such a better place now in my life, and I’m just...content. So now when I smoke I can really enjoy it and laugh at tv or sit on Reddit like right now. I think it all comes down to the pressure you feel in life. That shit gets heavy when you let it. Some years ago a friend asserted that different weed strains made them feel differently. One time I bought a shitty vape oil that sucked but had info on the label saying "this sativa is more energizing" and this other one is "more sedating and... stuff."

Recently I had a bag of Sour Diesel and another containing some kind of Cush. I believe it was the Sour that made me feel anxious, even before bed.... including that introspection, that self analysis going on in my head. 


The following day and days I smoked the other shit until I ran out and the Cush did not apepar to affect me the same way I eventually had to go back to smoking the Sour until I ran out and bought more. 


It wasn't terrible, but I felt like when on the recent batch of cush I felt better psychologically and emotionally. While getting a good night's sleep. Most any weed will make me feel anxious if I smoke it in the day time especially if I gotta go to work.... but if I smoke a batch and don't feel that way during the day then I'm impressed by the strain.[deleted]Omg yes, absolutely. That's a really good point honestly and I agree with it. Not to downplay anyones struggle but once you open pandoras box o' drugs it seems impossible to even go backWhat’s for good though? I have 1 year and 1 day clean and I’m 28 I won’t get into my story but I started iving herion at 18. So if I stay sober until the day I die of natural causes I ain’t ever had an issue but god forbid I relapse which I know is a heavy possibility i might have some issues or if I od in the mcdonalds bathroom and don’t get brought back someone might say damn yo he had some issues he should’ve got help!  Said it many times but i used dope compulsively to the point my kidneys were failing. I still chain smoke cigs and weed trying to get that miniscule hit of dopamine but im clean from heroin/subs 1 year+. Until I get cancer im going to stay off opiates, then im going back full force.Well, that's simply false. Fair and fascinating statement. This is basically why I hope I continue to be reluctant to say "if I could do it..." It's not fair for those who just have a different balance of chemistry in their brain and bodies. It doesn't make them any less of a person and I'm sure it would be way harder for me to be where I am today if I was successful with my IV attempts or if I was in the game for longer before beginning to kick.Yeah man. Swear it can tear you up inside. I mean on one hand you should stay "clean and sober" and live the good life....yeah and then on the other its like the good life is a fucking joke and so boring you wanna just quit it completely. Besides there is nothing wrong with using drugs recreationally once in a while, we just like to take it too far. 

Besides, what do we as humans exist to do? What do are our brains built to do? EXPERIENCE PLEASURE... 

 Its one of those "do I have a problem or is it everybody else?" Type of situations. Im with you but opioids are the best drugs there are, there's no argument about it. Not to mention opioids seem to kick way harder than usual if you've been up a couple of days on stimulants. but you hurt others and might die thoSounds about right, always blazed my own pathOf this list I have 1 thing (a job) and half a roof over my head and I have 15mos clean. Not doing so well compared to this.I know I feel better in life when I don't have a plan and just go with the flow I've noticed...I was never that way though. I always thought I had to do shit by the books. I don't know why but I HAD TO!!! I had a baby really fucking young and dropped out of school but I had to get my Ged and get a job. You would think I'd be happy but I wasn't. I had anxiety like a motherfucker. 

My kids dad committed suicide and it wasn't until then that I really understood my life. After that I guess my life took a turn on some spiritual type journey but it was different than anything I experienced before. It completely turned my world upside down but I found myself happier with my life turned upside down. Almost like you're focused on over coming that tragedy or something. Lol I don't even know if any of this makes sense... 
And when my life gets more stable I start to get more depressed. Kinda like deep inside I don't want to be stable. But I don't know why I wouldn't. I really do envy the people who can just do drugs and stay up all night and don't have to take care of their kids. They can do what they want. But I don't know if I would ever really be happy if I lived that kind of life. Lol it's confusing...Don't be sorry, this discussion is really important and useful. We're (mostly) all still here but the problems also remain. Some people have to play a really terrible hand in life because what's given is in your DNA and there is very little that can be done, medically. When that dysfunction is mental, that is a double penalty because we understand so little about the mental side of health. The drugs are really a sledgehammer to crack a nut but what choice do we have? If you feel bad and you don't know why, the drugs are very appealing. And now you have a new problem.

In my own case, I don't believe I have any major mental health issues but they still brought me very low, to a dark place I never imagined I would go. It took me years of self reflection and therapy to recover but I found a way and now I'm quite happy. When I say the key to the sober life is to find something you love I suppose what I mean is you have to find your particular way. You have to keep experimenting with a new approach and observing the results. Discard the things that don't work and keep the ones that do. Each person is different, there is no magic formula. Also writing sober.Hence the lol. No, I think EVERYONE should drop acid/SAll they do is talk about drugs and the good old days!Good luck with that[deleted]I didn't down vote bcs I respect those who choose to believe but what put me off was the fact that he implies that we, for some fkn reason, need to create an idea in our minds of a higher power bigger than us controlling our lives just to be able to cope with existence and carry on. To me, it sounds like putting a band in front of your eyes and just ignore the whole thing. Yeah, getting food on the table is higher on the priority list.thanks!! i ran a mile last night (took me 9 minuets lol.. I'm 6'3 175... felt 5'7 250 ha) and have been doing 40-50 pushups daily. Not much but i can feel a little difference I want to get back into it.   I used to have an exercise addiction and sustained a lot of permanent damage with chronic pain...but I can swim and walk.  I did myself in on the runners high, but I already had problems and kept going. Highly recommend if you can do in moderation. Baclofen is the bee’s knees �I am going the other. I have thought alot about this. I am going to help others do so as well, and remove anyone who tries to stand in the way. Thank you.  I never really saw them as addictions, but I suppose they are :-)
I just recently got an Eboard!  Inboard M1 :-)Well spoken man. Thank you Yeah, absolutely. It’s pretty difficult to change your perspective on what’s fulfilling and what’s not, but it can be done. Drugs are an easy way to shortcut in to that fulfillment, although usually with negative repercussions following if left unchecked> The issue is that 'doing' things that are considered worthwhile net zero fulfillment once you've experienced the pleasure of IV hard drugs. This is especially true if those things are monetarily driven. 


Get into astrophotography, it's quite the money pit but if you got money that isn't making you happy - perhaps spending it on such a hobby will bring happiness. Okay, it's not for everyone... I might get a $1500 mount shipped to me after it being back ordered for over a month only to discover that I get bored taking pictures of the moon and Jupiter under light-polluted skies.


Honestly though, I think I would feel emotionally less satisfied if it wasn't for my turtles and their existence in my life. They remind me that I need to forge onward and find more shit that brings joy to my life. Maybe I'm just afraid to leave them alone, or afraid to consider what it would be like for the remainder of my family to take care to my turtles if I were to meet my demise from an overdose.


I've never experienced IV heroin properly, but I got a glimpse of the sensation with my homemade rig. It was more numbing for me than blissful but a warm blanked regardless of the minutiae which comes to mind. It's easier to list negative reasons for going down that road, the IV drugs and snorted opiates road. All the while it's harder to list things which bring joy after experiencing that.



Working for a living, living the dream or the robotic existence as seen in the picture is quite soul draining and a walk in the park on Saturdays doesn't cut it. I've seen men work all their lives only to deteriorate within a decade of retirement and die. Sure, it's nice knowing that your progeny get your money but such a man who worked his ass off deserved to reap fruits of his labor.  


I don't know where I'm going with this now, pardon my rant. Your statement was far more succinct and poignant. Do you spend anytime outside doing activities you enjoy? I find that is a great way to enjoy some sober fun and get away from the grind.Nicotine makes me sick, I still indulge on occasion but I swear if I smoke a couple of hours after my sub dose I'm more likely to feel nauseous. 

There was a time I could burn a pack a day will little to no ill effects (at least none I can recall) t now if I chain-smoked three in an hour I would feel some kind of way.

I tend to prefer cowboy killers but everyone I know basically smokes menthols.Do you do all the NA / Jesus  stuff? I'm looking into the most sucessful clean people and it seems a lot of them do this NA / Jesus stuff,  unfortunately I just can't bring myself to believe in the supernatural :(You sound like me.  I always say someday I’ll go back to them but today I’m as sober as I can be (kratom and soon medical marijuana).  Heroin does not cause kidney failure.It’s just so ignorant thisyeah no other drug interests me.  Stims nope, weed (hate it), alcohol (too impairing and depressing),  LSD not for me;  opiates are the perfect drug for me personally.  I have friends who hate opiates and am amazed I like them so much, but then the same goes for their DoC's for me[deleted][deleted]1st. Yes, much of that didn’t make much sense. 

2nd. In your first paragraph you say “You would think I'd be happy” — no, I wouldn’t think that. Sounds terrible. My bad lol man we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha. 

And maybe you're right... everyone should take acid/S to open their 3rd eye and get their chakra into alignment and the we can have a new awaking and become the United States of Consciousness... Since it was your idea you can be our new enlightened president. :o :DYou'd be +100 if you had said this the first time, ain't no-one dumb enough for that Jesus shit in 2019Now try that stuff high. LmaoYou’re welcome. This.   Seeking fulfillment is what we are all after.  It is much more difficult to do in the real world sober and it damn near looks impossible once you have taken a pill,snorted or IV a drug and achieved that fulfillment immediately.   That being said if you work hard at fulfillment in sobriety (this means lots of work on mental health - therapy/possibly medication) it can be just as good as the opioid euphoria.  Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. Did you consider having kids/a family?  I thought maybe having a wife and kids might make me happy but honestly my friends with wives/kids; they want to take any opportinity to get out of their houses and come out with us single guys; it's a lot of hard work. My happiest friend is the one who lives aloneYeah, it's true.. even if I'm resistant to it - it always helps lift my mood to go outside for any reason.No, I go to a 666 step program at our lady of the dark lord satanic cathedral.Not in and of itself, but the impurities of street drugs combined with the lifestyle and the muscle deterioration when falling out can cause kidney issues without a doubt. Happened to me. The only stim I like is amphetamine, (which I take most days in the form of adderall), I love weed too and I think weed really shines when you are under the influence already, especially with opioids. 

Other than drinking a bit every now and then, I don't really care for much else. Benzos, psychs, dissos, etc. Are pretty much garbage imo and I dont bother with em. 

Its just that opioids are good literally whenever. I could write a book about why I like opis the best but ill spare everyone, bottom line, they just feel the best. drug usage itself is not necessarily hurtful to others but the illness called addiction is damaging to you and your environment. there is also a difference between recreational and therapeutical usage.others can also be for example neighbors, people you stealing from, your colleagues, family members, partners... society gets hurt by addiction, addicts can’t help it but denying the damage that is done is fueling the desire to use.

of course you are going to die, dying from drugs can be very sudden and early in life.This!I was chosen> we need a way to be able to tell sarcasm over the internet haha.

... can’t tell if you are being sarcastic or not.

But by ending his comment with /s , he was showing sarcasm. [deleted]My first thought � Feel like Jon Stewart in half baked. Ive done it all high... And I thought I had to keep doing it high.   I quit getting high for a time (I wont quit forever) and I quit doing most of those things for awhile as well.  Then after a few months I went back and started some of those things again, or for the first ttime.  I don't know if I will ever reach that same euphoria, I havnt had a relationship since I was 14 (almost 21 now) and have been rejected countless times. My friends barely hangout with me, i'm just so depressed and so damn lonely. Oxy is the only thing that fills the void in my heart. It doesn't help that all throughout high school I was bullied so much that it scarred me emotionally. People treat me like i'm just a junkie and that i'm going to abuse everything i get my hands on. My friends were worried and mad I got an adderall and vyvanse script, yet I havnt abused either and only have abused adderall prior to getting a script when I was in my darkest times. My friends and doctor don't trust me with a benzo script either even though i suffer from panic attacks every week, and I only had xanax in my blood from abuse once when I tried to commit suicide with it and risperadone. Now I can't get benzo scripts unless it's the ER, all because I was suicidal. I don't know what i'm even getting at man life just sucks so much these last few months. Thank god I found some percs, too bad it's my friends grandmas last script, so she wont be able to sell me them anymore after that.The problem is our socieities are not setup this way, life in daily grind is not conducive to this fulfillment. We can try, though. > Plus it doesn’t come with the same baggage. 

This is my favorite go-to when my friend Tim asks, "do you miss doing dope?"I have found strangely the more opiates I have, the less I think about them - that is if I buy a months supply off the DNM's, I won't really think about them other than doing my dose after work and enjoying the evenings. 

Whereas in WD's I think about them all the time (obviously early wd's you can't focus on anything else; in later WD's you remember the good times)

yet if I am in a dry spell I think a lot more about where I'll get them from - I guess it's the same thing if you were running out of water.

I also think if you use opiates as a crutch to help you with a life/job you hate, that is when you are going to run into much bigger problems staying clean.  I am lucky in a sense I only used them because I enjoyed getting high - I didn't use them to escape any mental stress or any physical pain - they would just be two major triggers to continue using againYes, especially since my brother and wife are planning not to and want to keep their money for vacations and trips to matha's vineyard.

I'm banking on the fact that as a man my ability to produce viable source DNA will last through my 50s.  I want to get my childishness out of my system, learn to or find ways to make more money or get a more established career. Only then would I want to have children. Although I might meet someone and accelerate the turn table, I wont bring children into this world if I can't provide for them. At least, I'd prefer to avoid that stress factor. 


I would love to be like my mom's cool cousin who is single and chills out collecting comic books and whatnot, but I my father's genetics can't afford that level of selfishness. If we are to continue his genes and my genes - I must procreate, eventually. 

I hope to be an older father with money, with a unique peace of mind that comes from experience. Whether I have a boy or girl. Even if my daughter is "hot", I want us to have a good relationship that ensures that she is armed to make good decisions but also free to make her decisions without worrying about me being a judgmental dick about things.

If I have a boy, I my biggest fear is that they'll be lazy and stupid because of modern tech. I might just make my kids uses old technology for a few years and pretend that it's normal. Then again, they will need to learn to code very early on.


I want it both ways.[deleted]Iphone addicti9n and social media are also harmful to us all but are you gonna prosetlyize against that None of us asked to be conceived or born, we never asked to be raised to adulthood, we owe society 0.

I'm in this game for ME, the only person I will work to benefit that isn't me is my child. The rest are on their own.Oh ok lol I never knew that ending things with "/s" meant it was sarcastic.Nah my man, they clearly ain't all that intelligent if so.Yess!! That one dude that does everything sober but then tries it high. You ever smoked weed...on WEED man?one of my best "highs" ever was on Day 6 or 7 of an oxy kick, first real day of hot sun during the year (UK is a real depressing place most days),  the natural endorphins were flowing; went for a walk in the woods with some ambient music in on my own.  It sounds so lame to read it back now but it was a great sober high.  Unfortunately you can only get this pink cloud by going through 5 days of WD's...

Now if there was only a way to re-create this high on demand, say by ingesting something... but alasI could relate to some extent with two aspects. First with regard to bullying, high school was fine but Junior High School sucked real bad. I wasn't an angel either, I did some edgy things for the sake of fun and amusement which got me in trouble during the lunch period. I remember one time everybody wanted to play basketball but the gym teacher wanted everyone to sit on the bleachers first. Well, I couldn't find a seat and when I did find one in the back corner near the edge, a couple of African-American students were sliding horizontally down the bench into me in order to make me fall off. So I said to myself (probably), "fuck it, I'll just stand next to the bleachers on the floor."


&nbsp;


Perhaps I was a bit aloof, but because I wasn't sitting down the teacher was like "everyone's not sitting down so you all can't play basketball." After that mad black folks (the majority of this class) were ragging on me and beating up on me, only one was at least kind enough to provide clarification as to why they were all pissy. I sorted my shit out but I always felt like very few members of faculty had my back - probably because they had a lot to manage as the school was basically overpopulated on the whole.


&nbsp;

Then if that's not enough, my "best friends" at the time were hit-or-miss. Snotty about academics, but not too good to take shortcuts and cheat on exams when possible. Perhaps I should've employed more of the same tactics, the truth is that I'm too lazy to do my school work - cheating or not. I hate when they used to send out deficiency notices in the middle of the semester - sort of like a midterm report card. One time I'm walking home with my "friends" on that day when we got deficiency notices and my "friend" is just basically telling me "you're a lazy bitch." Be that as it may, although I'm definitely not a bitch in any form.. it's none of his fucking business. 


&nbsp;

One smart Jewish-Christian friend was snotty but he did honest work and achieved a lot of shit as well as extra-curricular shit. The other friend who called me a "lazy bitch" was more hardcore Jewish - raised by an Israeli father. He didn't have the best home life, bullied by his brother Derrick (same one who middles dope) and so  I think it was just reflex for him to be a dick about shit. We all matured, I mean like I still wouldn't have him do my taxes as he is an accountant now because of the shame associated with making less money and letting him see that fact.


&nbsp;

Now, back to you... I often feel down and sure, Xanax would help, Valium would be wonderful too but there is so much downside potential associated with becoming dependent on either. \*\*Physical activity always helps me feel better and cuts back on anxiety.\*\* Sometimes I find it hard to start, many days I look forward to the end so that I can go to bed - sometimes I go to bed way earlier than possible. I slept 12 hours last week in one night because of that. 


&nbsp;


I'm still very confused about how my emotions work when I wake up super early so that I can have "me time" before work. I get super tired in the afternoon and then I get a second wind later in the evening.. it's like my biological clock is tuned for a "better mood" at certain times.


&nbsp;


What I want to convey is, how we feel today is an amalgamation of shit that has happened before - which we cannot change. We can only try to control or wrestle control over how we handle it. I'm not you and I'm not your doctor (not that you agree with your doctor at the moment) but I really believe in the downside potential in using benzos. Hell, people talk about downside potential in taking Subs yet I do so because I feel that the risk of having a hard time getting off was worth it in order to have a chance at breaking the cycle.


&nbsp;

Knowing how my snottier friends would act, I've avoided sharing anything with any of them about my addiction. Some of them know or heard rumors, that's how I had to deal with a failed intervention in July of 2017. I bullshitted my way out of it and took another year before I switched completely to subs. 


&nbsp;

One times I saw one of my better "smart" childhood friends and he seemed to be genuinely concerned for my well being, it's like I could see it in his eyes or something... that he heard shit about me and heroin. Another too who was buying stuff at my job. Both cases I was able to reasonably assure them or give a solid appearance of well being. Especially now, as I get into an expensive hobby like astrophotography -- how could I be an addict? It's sort of like how I said "how can I be an addict, I would have sold this stack of laptops if I was."

&nbsp;


With regards to not wanting to be treated like a junky; Cliff's brother has his suspicions about me being a junky but I denied it. I will not open up to him because of the time I took acid and watched Iron Man II with him. He fucking told one or two of our "straight-edge" friends for whatever reason. So one day I'm in the Vitamin Shoppe and an old friend who ultimately became a cop recently, he was like "I heard you did acid" in a fucking smug ass lame ass tone. 

&nbsp;


Of course I asked, "where did you hear about that?" His response: "the grapevine." That motherfucking chicken shit, if you got the balls to fucking tell me you know I did some acid have the goddam balls to tell me how you fucking know. I can figure it out anyway and I'm not gonna go and do something about it either way. Except maybe speak to the source and be like "dude, why'd you tell that friend about that? I'd like to keep that shit private because people go on tangents and spread gossip." I don't like when people hear something and share their judgemental tone. Do on to others as you would like them to do on to you.

&nbsp;



I hope something in here serves as food for thought or helps in some way through relatability.Yep, and that is why recovery is so fucking hard. But you have to find a way to incorporate fulfillment into your life. We could probably fix a lot of social problems if we fixed a lot of social problems, hahaha"Do you miss doing dope"  -     "Do you miss having sex with beautiful women" or "Do you miss eating delicious food"You ever shoot up after scoring before you drive home? Then you are potentially affecting other people in a bad way, or will eventually.Yo bro,i feel the same way but i have a fiery vengeance in me to want to tear down the man made conditions setup which funnel us into drug use. I have a picture in my head and i know it is real and it is a world where people dont willingly commit slow suicide by drugs or any othet method to drown out whatever static noise is being shoved in faster than i can shovel out. People ARE to blame for this mess. 

I watched my dad self medicate with alcohol and anger my whole life and i thought i was smarter, but look at the path i chose. I dont even hate him for it out of thr moment, how could i. Just trying to copeIt’s ironic you brought up sarcasm after he used /s

:p[deleted]bruuuhh that shit wildI feel good from opiates, but the kind of high you are describing... I feel better from that. Thank you for taking the time for this reply man, I really appreciate it. I just used the last of my oxy, and probably won't be able to get any forever or a very long time, so I suppose today is the first day of recovery again. I'm gonna try doing some physical activity, maybe just a dog walk to start, but something is better than nothing. Hopefully I can be happy without drugs some day. 

&#x200B;

Thank you again for this reply man <3Definitely not by incorporating the corporate lifestyle though.Tim who asks that question about dope, I asked him if he had any loss in sex-drive and he said yes. However, his sex drive is fucking strong --- strong enough that he goes to brothels every week behind his wife's back. A man without a sex drive doesn't need to spend money on sex, unless that's just his form of masturbation and he just does pays professionals to do it for him.

&#x200B;

I do enjoy delicious food and having to  worry about obtaining dope. Really just glad not to have to deal with middles like Derrick who say they will be confidential but open their big mouth the instant it benefits them for any reason.[deleted]yeah I want to change this dumbass society too but what can we do?

I work in a school, I always tell the students do not vote for the mainstream parties (UK here), and if you do, you have no right to complain about the State as you are a direct cause of it. Luckily despite the Teen stereotype a lot of them are not stupid, plus they have access to the 'Net so they know the score. I show them the websites that list the sleaze all of our supposed "betters" (politicians etc) get upto over here (the anti-drug, church going Member of Parliament who was caught doing a line of cocaine off of a young teenage boys chest...) We have the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. You can pretend that it's fine and reasonable to ignore th overwhelming evidence against it all you want, just tricking yourselves. and it's not really up for debate lmao. Any religious person is a moron.Unless you're willing to drink the coolaid and feel at home in the company's hermetic office environment. Still, they'll kick anyone out on their ass once they become more trouble than they're worth. Offering golden parachutes to those higher up in the caste, using HR to cover their asses legally when they feel that someone needs to be "let go." yea man if I want to do some opiates after work, then who is anyone to tell me I can't?  Because I could potentially affect someone in a bad way?

So by that logic then fatties should all be put into work camps until they weigh a healthy weight, because they also affect others in a bad way by causing global warming?  

Should we all be a Master Race of people who are 100% healthy? Should we be forced this way against our will?  (currently over here our Elites are trying to force us all to be a non smoking, non drinking, perfectly healthy Master Race. Meanwhile these Elites are all fat, drinking, drug taking, lazy wastes of space - but it is not about our health. It is about us taking less sick days and working harder for them.)[deleted]That's another point really, the fact that we are at the loose end of the stick, and that they couldn't care less about anyone below themselves. Thus why bother doing anything for them assholes, other than the bare minimum to keep collecting your pay check.My evidence would be what god would create and allow such a terrible existence?

If there were an all powerful god, and he created everything, including all the evil shit, then he is a fucking asshole dick cunt fucker.

I hope you’ll respond. You can't be serious.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: hmm, Content: , ups: 1114, downs: 0Made me laugh dopesick as fuck. Take your upvote.I actually tested positive for opiates on a Drug test recently by eating an everything bagel the morning of the test. My probation officer didn't believe me, of course lolLololIt’s always the fckn bagel.Damn poppy seed bagels get you every timeOk.... this one was goodOk you made me laugh and i woke up and pissed my dog off.  He’s giving me the ol’ stink eye. He’lol pass back out soon though lol. LolThings that make ya go ¿QUE? Also you shouldn’t  be smoking babies. No, you should snort babies the high is cleaner.i knew those everything bagels had some jizz on em“......shouldn’t a got that butter AND cream cheese.”Ahh all those people who don’t read twitter probably think you thought this up :-)

Do you have any more gems from other people’s twitter accounts?u/CockRaterGirlWow laughing whilst sick. You must of found this unearthly hilarious. Hope the sickness will be taking care of, the impending sickness for me is right around the bend,fucking again ��I had a very faint positive at the methadone clinic. I was so confused and I was swearing up and down that I didn't touch anything because I hadn't taken anything in over 3 years at that point but they probably hear that all the time.

I realized I ate the everything bagel the night before and that morning and she said she believed me but I still told them to send it to get tested and I came back that afternoon to sample again and it was negative. I was always told it was a myth. Didn't they disprove this on mythbusters?Good luck finding crushable babies anymore.Damn, don't you hate it when you eat jizz and get pregernante?uh what LolI would rather be mildly high and staring down the barrel of a five day withdrawal than sober, which I currently amSry to hear fellow. Love your name, Ruby is da shit, hope you get well soon bro! Late reply, but is your name a $B reference?Nah, they proved that it happens. Just employer drug tests usually Bing at a higher point than government ones because they know small things like that can set a test off. I heard putting them in the microwave helps. You can still find them in Canada. i hate when i have my everything bagel and get the preggers :( Idk man I def don't miss the days of constantly being on the edge of withdrawal not even being able to get high anymore with shitty tar just using to not be sick. But it's such a nice day. Yupyupp
Ahhh got it. Good to knowOr dissolving them in coca colaThats where im at The more you know. And knowing is half the battle. And knowing is half the bagel @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Always some long drawn out process, Content: , ups: 1086, downs: 0[deleted]Oh god, this reminds me of one time my dealer and her boyfriend (who was the real dealer, she was more the middle i guess) arguing in front of me and him shouting about her selling to junkies as I’m standing there so fucking uncomfortable. Dude ended up feeling bad for saying that and threw me like 3 extra pills but Jesus if I didn’t want to just disappear at that moment!! �� in the 80s a guy offered me all the coke i wanted if i "JUST DONT LEAVE"

talk about a dilemma, listen to his shit for the next 24 hours doing unlimited coke or dip out with a gram for $80Why are they beefing? Explain the trouble in paradise.Ha. Makes me appreciate my guy. Car only 5 min max. One of my guys does this shit but is really cool and fast if he sees youre in wd. Real mvp that guy. Hey man dealers got feelings tooThis is why I always did a bag right before heading out to cop. My buddy would be sweating bc he did the wake up bag last night lol[Free R Kelly!](https://youtu.be/HiIla9Mqo1I) This is incredible [removed]Isn’t this photo shopped? No it's on purpose, otherwise kid be out and never listen to there bullishThen does he get all pissed off when you suggest hurrying it up? It's like they have zero self awareness. Either that or they get some fucked up satisfaction out of screwing people around in stupid petty ways. The good dealers make so much more not fucking around. Probably also don't get popped over super petty shit or at least not as often.When I was a benzo junkie my guy would forget where he left his bars all the fucking time since he was a bar head too, even though he had huge bags of literally hundreds (probably thousands). It’d always be in some dumb spot like behind the detergent in the laundry room or in one of the kitchen cabinets. Once he left them at a barber shop and he made me drive him up there (he said he’d throw me 20) and there was a ziplock bag of at least 500 double stacks still on the counter where he cut his hair and nobody fucking noticed, not even the bar heads who work there. One guy I know is lonely af and has no friends so he’ll sit there and talk to you for a fucking hour. It’s so annoying A dope dealer that was upset about junkies wanting dope?  Wtaf �So what did you do?This is the R Kelly interview on CBSAs I understand it, they're not. This was just an interview on CBS that got a bit heated and emotional. Props to the interviewer though, she stayed totally calm and chill while he was freaking the f out. Franco- "Hey, you ever think you could like pull the plug on someone? Hypothetically I mean"
Rogen- "What!? Y-ymean like on her? I dunno man I don't got a lot of time, I got to go to my girlfriend's dinner and shit I... I could go on all day about... euthanasia."My dude lives in the same apt complex so delivers to my door. So even it im waiting it's in my bedBoondocks did it.?Oh I'm sure the power goes to many of their heads. I had a guy who did that kind of shit on purpose. For opsec purposes he would refuse to meet up (used bitcoin for payment) and would drop off the product at some random location where you'd have to go and pick it up. Honestly, I'd prefer some annoying conversation than having to go fish under a toilet at a bar.It's for security purposes too. Can't have people heading in and out within minutes.This who tf else does he expect to sell too? Kindergarten teachers and zen monks?Lied and said i had to go home and take a shower, that id be back but i never came back.

the sad thing is ive met others who were scared to death to be alone .   They werent all on drugs. One guy was filthy rich and just couldnt stand not to have a crowd around at all times.

even if they were tearing up his shit and trashing his place and taking advantage of him and borrowing money ect...I wish R. Kelly would go away (and take the Trumps with him).

TO SLOVENIA!!!

*snapping a whip*A lot of black ghetto plugs are racist as fuck and get a kick out of fucking around with white customers, especially if they look wealthier or like timid college kids. Or they will make power moves or requests, then laugh about the "fucking wyt boi" they just got to drive them around. They get off on the feeling they have power over those they see as having a better life than them, a lot absolutely despise junkies too.

&#x200B;

A lot of the white plugs especially the older ones are the "I'm lonely" type, or they are also junkies serving to support their habit and want you to use with them so they feel like less of a junkie somehow or listen to their life story and play therapist and other kinds of nonsense.That dude sounds paro, but I bet he hasn’t gotten caught.  Why would he put it under the toilet in a bar? A place with cameras? Shitty opsec right there.Fr I’m fucking done ��Comedy goldSounds like jessie from breaking bad Damn. Seems like a tweakers dreamI've only ever had hood connects in 11 years and have never experienced what you're talking about. One of my guys actually called and apologized for being an angry asshole to my girl and I. Everyone's different. I can certainly say I've ran into the 2nd. I've never really dealt with many black folks and the ones I have dealt with have been really cool except 1 experience.

The lonely type that will front just to have somebody to talk to. When I was younger in my early 20s I had an older dealer in his mid 40s. When me and my friends would stop by he would think of the situation as more of a hangout than a sell. I think he was trying to re live his younger days. He would talk and talk and it was so hard to get away. Especially when you're sick and just want the shot asap. A few moments I'm not proud of are the times I sat over there just to get free dope. He would also front just to have somebody to talk to lol I felt bad for him.99% of their sales are on the Dark Web where they're a big vendor. This was just a favor they did for me.It was dumb as fuck. But I didn't know anyone else. He mostly sold online and I figured  out he was in my city so I asked if he'd do something direct. So it wasn't like he had a bunch of people going into a bar's bathroom and then leaving. And it was a different place every time, which made it very annoying. But when you're a junkie and you're desperate...almost forgot about that,,,,,,bb always portraying realness in the show ,good team of writers....that part in the series is soo depressing, when he's just zombies out with the big speakers always playing, and the roomba lolI once had a dealer ask me to meet him at a convenience store, probably the worst place to meet for a drug deal. Then when we both got there, a cop was outside. So he motions to me to follow him into the store where I hand him the cash as we walk in. Rather than just hand me my satchel, he tosses the bag on the store shelf in front of 3 employees. What a god damned moron. Now what, I’m supposed to take something off a store shelf and put it into my pocket, looking like a thief with a cop right out side.... *sigh* @@@@@@@@@@ Title: A couple of years ago she saved my life. I was nodding out on benzos and opiates super hard and started to choke on my tongue because I was lying on my back. She jumped on my stomach which caused me to sit up. I owe her a lot., Content: , ups: 1059, downs: 0Narcat?Absolute hero cat. She wanted to make sure you'd still be around to feed her, servant. Did you name her narcan?Believe it or not cats have super senses and can sense things people can't there are cats that know when their owner has cancer before they or anyone else even does.Good Kittyshes a cutie :)This is amazing ❤️❤️❤️. Sorry to hear about you possibly almost loosing your life but I'm glad your furbaby saved you!!Good kittySome cats can be really good kids.You cant swallow your own tongue.  So I'm calling bullshit also.  We get it. You vapeIs your cat part Russian blue? She looks very similar. We have one as well. Best cat ever. The real og Are u still using eitherThose Russian blues always have a resting bitch face. Russian blues every one I’ve know has been crazy expect for one who was just mean because he was old and had health issues to where he couldn’t clean so he had dreads on his back. My dad had one that lived to be 19 and only died because he got into a fight with another cat one night when we let him out to dick around in the garden in the front. His tooth broke off in that fight and it got infected which killed him he was too old to fight it off :(. Was one of the few times I saw my dad cry, it was his cat while he was in college. My cat died 2 years ago one that I had since I was 8 and lived with me when I got my own place at 22, I cried like a bitch for weeks, it was hard watching him go down and slowly die over his last year of life but he was extremely sweet and loving that last year. He was such a badass cat, I don’t know if I’ll ever have a cat like him. He did not act like a cat his personality was more like a human. I almost nodded off to my death due to a combination of opiates and benzos in my car but was saved by a stranger who screamed "fuckin junkie!" Honestly, that person unknowingly changed my life greatly; the crazy thing about that event was the comment wasn't even aimed towards me..�����Ohhhh whatta cutie, and so erm...well fed �[deleted]It's not actually possible to choke on your tongue. Source: I used to lifeguard and I took multiple CPR/rescue breathing classes.Crazy how our furry friends have our backs! I passed out on bars and Roxies too and my little guy was scratching at my chest so hard he broke the zipper off the jacket I was wearing at the time! Funny because it didn't wake me up, but when I woke up the next morning you can imagine the level of confusion I experienced when looking down at my jacket....lolI call bull lol sorry broI thought the same thing, then saw you posted if too!! LolLegit name �Never fear Narcat is here!!We need super cats with narcan claws to chill with while noddingAin’t that the truthNarcat I wouldn't call it super senses. Both cats and dogs have a far superior sense of smell and hearing. 

We generally don't realise that, but our body odour changes a lot depending on our physical condition. Both dogs and cats can be trained to warn a diabetic owner of a low blood sugar situation or an epileptic seizure. Dogs have an advantage here due to how much easier it is to train them. Also dogs have evolved to be vety good at reading human emotions. So a trained service dog can anticipate panic attacks or otherwise comfort an unstable person.

Long story short, it's not super senses, it's that the human that feeds them and cares for them suddenly smells and sounds differently. And that's a cause for concern.My cat used to lay on my chest for hours licking my face when I was using. Though she maybe just couldn't resist tasting me while waiting for the inevitable overdose to start devouring me. They do! My sisters cat knew I was in labor before I knew. She even followed me into the shower meowing at me. I was so confused until I felt it. Cats will also eat their owners eye balls after a couple hours dead where as dogs will start starve to death before considering eating their human 

Source: am dog guySuper sensesThere was one time she shit in my bathtub, then threw up on the carpet. But for the most part 10/10 So I googled that, turns out you’re right. So I’d have to assume either my throat relaxed to the point it restricted my airway, or I was choking on my saliva Bro you wanna see a smoke ring bro? Bro I’m wicked good at vape tricks bro She’s a dilute tortoiseshell

[She has very unique colouring ](https://imgur.com/a/evpmF0o) No, I’m on subs now since the start of this year Back off, The vet says she’s a very healthy weight :p



It’s gross, but you’re not wrong Cats are better than you’ll ever be, you probably think humans are better than animals. Yea it’s already been established elsewhere in the comments Ive seen a post and thought of a pun then gone to post it only to find somone beat me to it many a time ahaAm willing to invest in this project.Even better lolI’m type 1 diabetic funny enough. I knew someone with a blood sugar dog when I was younger, they’re goddamn amazing In a way, you are calling it a super sense though - superior (super) sense of smell.Dogs eventually will eat their owners too if they’re stuck with their owner’s body and have nothing else to eat! Dogs just wait a little bit longer than cats do to start.... probably because they’re so much slower than cats. Hehe.A couple of hours? I'm pretty sure it's more like after a week and the cat is starving to death.Go lick your dogs asshole My turtle doesn't think twice about shitting in the bath tub. I think it's automatic for them.

As for puking, my friend has a cat who usually pukes after eating leaves off of the house plants.Probably just had your throat in a restricted position that made everything feel compressed. Only way you can swallow your own tongue is to cut it loose from the bottom of your mouth first. 

Edit: perhaps you have sleep apnea that you only noticed when you were half-conscious and nodding out. Sleep apnea is a condition where as you sleep you’ll randomly stop breathing throughout the night, and it can sometimes feel like you’re choking. It has varying degrees of severeness, but it could be life threatening if left unchecked. Maybe go to a sleep clinic and have a sleep study done if you think that could’ve been what happened.  Bro fr bro? That’s wild broI wanna see tricks!!OP she's a real pretty one. I have a male cat that looks exactly like her!!!

More pics! I'll send you pics of mine if you'd like to see her twin hahaha.Congrats man Gotta love comments like these. How much do you hate humans? Look, the only reason why there is such a thing as "don't treat animals poorly" is because you are a human with a developed sense of what is right. There is currently nothing else in this universe that we're aware of that uses any kind of moral aside from instinct. Everytime you try to denounce human kindness, remember that a human just spoke those words. Not saying humans are superior, but we are the only ones even making this distinction[deleted][deleted][deleted]Right? Now I just look like a copy cat :( 

Couldn’t help myself. Reddit likes puns. It will save lives and cats. Its got no downsides. Someone $$$ invest asap into r&dit‘s all just words anyways, one can call it chubbahibbadub, doesn‘t change the awesomeness lolHehe good pointGoogle.. The truth is out there. I'm sure it varies, but at the end of the day you just never know if you and the kitty kat had this super epic soul mate relationship or if it just tolerating you and slowly bending you to do their will IMO Did you come here just to stick up for cats. It's a fucking joke based on facts so I think there is probably a much better chance that you are in fact the feline cunnilingus champion here. Live a very long and happy life fellow animal lover.You might want to tell your friend to be careful with their cat. Like dogs, cats will eat greenery to cause them to vomit, like a weird cleanse.

However some plants are poisonous to cats and by eating them, your friend’s cat could be getting sick and that’s why it’s vomiting.  I know for sure I don’t have apnea, this was the only incident I had experienced chocking on nothing. After this I wouldn’t lie down if I was nodding and I started to sleep on my side just for safety. 

It is totally possible that as I was nodding out I moved my head in a way that restricted my airway. Again I was lucky this was the only incident i had chocking Bro fr. I got mad sponsors bro you don’t find talent like mine very often bro I’d love too! I see other grey cats, but very few have the same colouring as mine, I don’t think she’s like a super valuable type of breed or anything, but I think her coat colouring is pretty rare 

So I’d love too see some look alikes :)Thanks, appreciate it I hate humans a lot actually & that’s not gonna change. I understand what you’ve written here but I’m confused about the point your trying to make, are you saying we shouldn’t care to treat animals & plants for that matter with respect because they can’t make the distinction ? Honestly you don't.  You rely on millions of humans keeping society together everyday.  You don't value dogs over humans, you take for granted humans.  You may value dogs personal company over humans.Lol so you would swerve out of the road for a dog and not a human? Nice broDamn, I really wish people like you could see how much my cat loves people & how excited he gets when we come home. What your saying is partly true but is way generalized, this dog or cat person thing actually has a lot of psychology behind it IMO, but ALL animals deserve to be respected & loved unconditionally because they serve a purpose far more wholesome than any human being ever could as all we do is hurt and destroy this planet. The UK actually did a study on this (surprising I know lol)  they found that the dogs waited a day longer than the cats but BOTH ate their dead owners. Hell, if I was locked in with no food supply, I’d eat you too… prob sooner than dogs and cats. Yeah actually you are an asshole because you used “kys”, I’m not gonna tell strangers to kill themselves. Like I said there’s a lot of psychology behind this animal preference & what I’m seeing is that happier people like dogs & more emotional or sad folks like cats. But the bottom line is I don’t want people treating animals poorly because the internet seems to always favor dogs under the premise of your “joke” about them eating their owners eyeballs after they pass or whatever. They’re animals & they have instincts. Personally I don’t give a damn if an animal was to eat me, at least then we served as some kind of actual purpose. Nah i feel ya. Its the first time ive gotten in on time ahaJesus your not wrong look at all those upvotes ahahahahIt would be kind of a downside if you’re just chilling and your cat scratches you playfully and you’re thrown into PWD.I'm not a cat person so I wouldn't be surprised either way. Owners do nothing but provide their cats with food... Even in death.feline cunnilingus = pussy eater.  HUR HUR.

Source: Am a cunning linguist and a master debater.[deleted]I’ve woken up choking on my own spit before like to the point to where I jumped up knocking shit all off of my counter freaking out trying to breath, my nose my stopped up to but eventually got a few breaths in through my nose enough to calm down and clear my throat shit was scary lolNo, I guess I didn't really explain my point now that I see it. I'm sry, english isn't my native language. I agree that we should treat all animals with respect, infact that's why I wrote this entire thing hahaha. I instantly felt like you were the type of guy to say you hate humans. Of course, I'm not expecting you to change opinions just because a stranger on the internet tells you to. I just find it sad to see people hate on humans that much, when the concept of good and evil itself was made by us. The fact that you are putting animals above yourself and want to protect them that dearly, even though it gives you no benefit, proofs that humans are the only ones to bring kindness and mercy to this world. A dog cannot understand a concept as complicated as that, he just really really likes you. I think we have an obligation to protect less developed animals. That's why I tryed to at least explain my view, because a lot of people seem to forget that they are humans themselves.

sry for the giant essay, have a nice day :) [deleted]I think the “copy cat” part was another pun-type joke to continue on the cat* trend since he missed his first shot. Sorry for the mini r/whooosh (always forget, 2 or 3 o’s)

Edit: *cat not carNot wrongGee, that got out of hand pretty fast. It's true tho, dogs are loyal AF and usually won't eat their owners. It's a somber beautiful thing to see a dog moaning next to his or her dead keeper.

I still might trust a cat more than a yorkie tho.
what a cunt you are[deleted]I completely understand what your saying friend and your English is A okay� no need to apologize for anything at all, but one thing I want to say is there is a major benefit from caring for these helpless plants & animals, at least for me there is. Nothing brings me more joy to be honest. Your despicable, why do you insist on trying to argue that cats are soulless. My cat literally runs around the fucking house & starts playing with all his toys and even dropping them at my feet wanting to play as soon as I walk in. Did you have a bad experience with felines growing up or something?! I don’t get why your so hung up on this, cats are amazing creatures that show us the same level of affection that we show them, if they were so terrible we wouldn’t be keeping them as pets since the beginning of human civilization. Defs a whooosh moment ahahaha“Come here buddy, who’s my cute little guyyy-OH FUCK, just kill me now!”.[deleted]that's because you're a good person :) [deleted]It’s ok cause I think he had a whooosh moment as well and completely missed that you missed his joke.[deleted]That would be so fucking shit cool. Really shitty too, but hey at least there's recycling going on.I appreciate that, hope you have a great day. I’ll help with your legit confusion then. Do you know what role plants play on this earth? Everything we eat, all our drugs, our clean air all come from Plants that are raped and abused. They just like animals are living and don’t have a way to fend for themselves against the greed of human beings tearing them down, controlling them or completely wiping them out without a care. So yes I consider them helpless, care to argue about this matter more? Ever heard of mass deforestation? Wtf I upvoted you and you're only back to 1, your post was hilariousIt’s gonna be the new diet trend. Will be started by Extreme liberal Vegans who begin to realize that eating plants is still killing/eating life and recycle to save the planet yo! Are you a vegetarian?  I hate people too.[deleted][deleted][deleted]tbh it's sad people think about plants the way they do. sure they can't express themselves, doesen't mean you don't have to look after them Don’t own a home & don’t have a lawn but if it was up to me I wouldn’t mow it. I don’t even smoke pot dude, just cause I give a fuck about the planet doesn’t mean I’m stoned & if being stoned makes you care about the things you should care for then maybe you should be smoking. Also don’t own anything made of leather or fur.

&#x200B;That’s cool. You look so young dude. Well done ��Keep up the good work.  And, as my psychiatrist tells me, *remember where you came from.*Left pic. �Wow I can’t believe that’s the same person! Congratulations. Remember, if you ever consider doing it “just one time” it will turn into “just weekends” then it will be a full blown relapse. My friend went 3 years clean and then about 5 months ago he got offered a single 4 milligram dilaudid, he said “fuck it I’ll do just this one pill and then that’s it, no more”. He’s now dope sick 3 days a week and going back to methadone clinic any day now. Anyways good job random person!! I’m 3 weeks clean now I hope I make it to 9 months like you!U look beautiful no matter what but def can see the different i assume u got clean? It looks goodCongrats, Ive been off the dope for a year and a half now, it's crazy how quickly things can changeAnd here I am just popped oxy for the first time ever. Waiting for it to hit.. Congratulations and you look great in both pics honestlyWay to go, girl. Proud of you. Am I the only one who likes the left one more? :D (only talking about the pictures)Happy for you! But you look pretty healthy on both pictures. I think if you would laugh on the first picture too, there wouldn't be a huge difference :)You look good in both tbh just dressed differently. Congrats on getting clean. Damn, if that ain't encouraging! Thanks for the motivation!If there's anything I've learned about addiction (especially to opiates), it'll steal your soul if you're not careful.  Meth will compromise your dopamjne reward pathways and rewire the way you think in a bad way. Plus it's cardiotoxic af, I'm thankful I never got TOO fucked up in the head after a year of doing meth IV.  Nowadays I just blow tree, take Adderall every now and take Xanax/kpins for anxiety. Anyway, congrats man that's a big milestone. You have my support �✌️What was your DOC? Aw, what a huge difference! And what a huge victory!! Keep going girl, you got this. Don't know you but am proud of you. �❤Awesome way to go and that's an amazing change! Always inspiring to see others making it happen one day at a time!r/gonesober candidate.What a difference. Congratulations!are you on any replacement drugs like suboxone?  that’s what i’m on now. only that. i just picked up my script actually. i know i’m not fully clean while on it, but at least i’m not acting all pathetic anymore. lol[deleted]Agent Scully?You look fantastic!!! ❤️❤️❤️Wow
Great work! The difference is astounding! 
Keep being strong! :)Wow! You’re beautiful � 4 months clean here. Keep it up!Congrats girl! I know how hard it is✌� much respect ; i wonder how does it feel to be reborn, to be back in life and reality again, they say the eyes are windows to the soul and i see a beautiful , unchained free spirit ✌�I'd tap datYou're really strong for making it out. Im so glad to see that your happy now too. Thanks for sharing.So pretty! You can see the difference. Great job. Get yourself a good milkshake or something that's a treat and celebrate. You deserve it. And your inspiring. Congrats.Will you marry me?  So beautiful.19 and addicted to oxy (with fent) over here. This is motivating and comforting to me knowing there’s still time to change.Tbh the doped out looks better.Looking cute AF in the right hand pic...great job congratsGirl on the left I'd run with for a while and ruin her life.

Girl on the right, too intimidating, haha.  Congrats on your sobriety.Wow,  you're looking so much healthier.  Beautiful girl either way.   Congratulations,  lotta hard work and dedication!  Keep up the good work! Wow you look like a completely different person. Sobriety looks good on you. Just celebrated 30 months clean myself. My transformation wasn’t as drastic lol.  Keep it up. It only gets easier. I'm gonna take a verbal dump because I'm in the middle of my addictions and I'm fucking miserable.

Do I think there's a genuine, no-relapse risk way out of addiction? Of course there is, but our society doesnt want to practice it. People become so scared of drugs and addiction that they take over your decisions completely, prohibiting the extremely critical trial and error you need to experience to recover. 


Either that, or they go with the other toxic extreme by completely ostracizing you from their lives, making you a complete outcast unworthy of a basic human relationship.

Now you, you are an attractive girl and as such you probably experienced the former, where your family and friends step in and say whatever they need to say to convince you you aren't well and need to turn yourself over to them (and the medical professionals who aim to make thousands off of you). You'll inevitably crack under the pressure since you're not really happy with yourself, submitting to whatever they want to do with you.

You'll go to rehab and they'll detox you and let you spill your feelings in a bunch of group therapies. Those therapies will be a bunch of addicts in denial about drugs, silenced by the counselors. The counselors will try to brainwash the prohibition standpoint and they'll hope you'll come out of there with the idea that you're not allowed to use drugs ever.

Time will pass and people will commend you for your sobriety. You'll slowly start to realize that you're doing this for other people and not yourself.

That voice in your head was never silenced because other people have forced sobriety on you rather than you enduring trial and error like you should have. One day that voice in your head will make you crack, and you'll go use again and you may or may not overdose.

You fall into the same cycle for a while and someone will find out, subsequently break the trial and error process you need to experience to recover and try and force sobriety on you. And you'll probably submit because - again you're a pretty girl and you've got the works in society for support.

The only true way out of addiction is to use and use and use again until you are so sick of it, even the worst suffering doesnt deter you from sobriety. You and only you can decide to stop and any attempt at being stopped by others is a quick road to relapse and overdose. /endrant


Go ahead, white knights, do your fucking worst in defense.Man filters do wondersIs this where I get in line to compliment some fishing for said compliments?

These posts are as cringy as the "look at my pupils I'm so faded lolz" posts.The difference is crazy !

I started young too, glad we didn't lose more of our lives...5 months clean myself! Congratulations ���Absolutely incredible, what a beautiful transformation. Truly inspiring, the difference in the 2 pictures is staggering. Never forget how far youve come. This post made me happy, thank you!How old are you? Asking because your head/face seems to have really evolved and it cant all be down to addiction right? Anyways keep it up. Looking great! ��� I'm glad you got through it! I've lost many due to opioids and I've seen a few clean up and I am more proud of them than everif that flag on your wall is the state your in then congrats fellow nutmeggerAm i gunna have to be the only one addressing the elephant in the room? The pic on the left is way, way hotter lol.You look a bit like Billie Eilish on the pic on the left. I'm just 3 months sober, and it feels great. People out there need to know that you can get better, but you need help. Please look into rehab, and recovery places. Don't wait until it's too late, or you're forced to do it. And make sure you are doing it for yourself![**r/whiteknighting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiteknighting/)I'm so happy for you, sweetie. I'm a grandma, and I'd give you a great big grandma hug if I could. 

I am not educated about eating disorders other than what the average person reads and learns, but I've lived 6 decades now, and I've seen how women distort their physical traits and focus on them. I've watched as we've gone from a society that was, in the 70s, telling women to think of themselves as more than a sexual partner for the pleasure of men to the present where we tell women how strong and capable they are, while writing articles in women's magazines about how to sexual appeal to others....and ads in those magazines featuring airbrushed thin and flawless bodies. I was enjoying happy hour recently in a very trendy and popular place, and I noticed the rap song playing was talking about women in the most insulting and sexually repressive ways. Around me were young women moving to the music and singing along. I can't express how screwed up all this is, and the damage it does to a woman if they let any of this in. 

All that to say....be realistic with yourself about what a woman's body should look like. Be different from what society is telling you.....the mixed signals are out there, and they have no business even being allowed into your space....you are way too good for that. Fight for you, your body and your health. Don't ever give in. If you can accomplish what you have already, you can challenge the dysfunctional and skewed thinking about your body that comes from both within and without. 

I want you to live to be a grandma. Despite the struggles along the way, it's just the most fantastic thing in the world to march into the next decade of your life, over and over again. Do it like you mean it. And I promise you, a normal aging imperfect body will be your best friend and take you everywhere you want to go.how did you do it? i need help!Em fee ee4leeeeeeeell lleellelleelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellleellelelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleelleelleellelelleelleelleelleelleellleelleelleelleellellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllrlYou look pretty in both pictures, but sooo much healthier and happier in the second one! I hope you're able to keep it up, girly! Great work, it's inspiring!What was your motivation to quit?/ why u quit?Love cures all things, was your libido also nonexistent with opioids? 

I’m a guy and on Kratom I look at hot girls with same desire as car.Wow what a transformation, you look great!You are amazing. Keep up the effort, it shows![deleted]Congrats!! It’s amazing what sobriety can do! I’m about 4 and half years now and it gets better and better everyday!! Keep it up ❤️Yeah!! You get it, girl! Congratulations![deleted]Damn you look strong, I am not even addicted to drugs but I struggle with my addictions still (video games and porn mainly). I don't know what would I have done if I was in your shoes because I can't even quit these addictions they are nothing like heroin or meth, my mind tricks me and tells me that I'd ratger die than quit these... I am trying to moderate them at the moment, hopefully it will work this time. Good for you on getting clean OP, I feel happy for you and sending you positive vibes!!!You are the type of people I look upto and think there's still hope. If people can beat opiate addiction then I think I too can bring myself and my life together for better.Yeah but how about without a filterGlow up �Congratulations!! Looks like you’re killing it!!! Sending so much positivity your way!I believe you have a doppelgänger running around ohio. Wow, you look amazing,congratulations! WowwwRighteous moo cow you look crazy good. Beautiful girl good for you ���Thanks. I think ima do the same thing as u when i get off suboxone. kratom is a really cool herb. u might wanna stock up on a lot of them tho to be safe, cuz who knows how long the government will let it stay legal. i know it’s stupid, but kratom doesn’t make them any money so it will probably become scheduled one day. Congrats. You look great. Great! So happy for you, looks like two completely different ladies. It is, of course. You're a beautiful person with a lot of life in front of you, may it be a beautiful future. Continued strength and focus to you!!!You’re are too young to trash your life away. Huge props. Keep it up, you look great. Damn girl.  You lookin cooler than the other side of the pillow.  Keep that shit up.[deleted]Omg you are so tiny! I'm jealous... I'm the same height as you. I'm a year clean and I gained like 15 pounds. I'm now 135 and I hate it. At my lowest in my addiction,  I was 105 and people said I looked horrible and disgusting because I was so thin. But I secretly loved it lol. ❤️ Good luck to you! Any secrets on losing the weight?? awesome awesome � one day at time girl, congrats�Congrats on making it this far. You look vibrant and happy. Like truly happy. Something about you gives off this “I’m a good person” vibe which is dope to see. I usually have a good eye for that. 

Rock on, and again, props. Keep doing what got you to right now. I'm not on Reddit often at all these days, but will look at my feed once in a while randomly.. this post makes me glad that I did!!! Currently in the thick of things but have been wanting to get out, & your post (and others like it) are so motivating & inspiring.. hopeful. It's so easy to fall into that negative thinking, that it can't be done, that everyone fails... It's inspiring to be reminded that that's not always how it goes & success IS possible! Fear is the main thing that keeps me stuck where I'm at, and seeing the difference in people who have made that leap really helps me to feel less afraid! I had 2 years at one point & it was the happiest I've ever been, you've reminded me of that! Thank you, & congratulations! Ur actually so hot in the pic on the left idk whyIsn’t funny how ya get hot once clean? I swear I made a full 180 in terms of looks. Once you start showering daily again and eating right it puts the life right back in ya?! Looking great! You are lovely!!! It looks like your soul is gone in the picture on the left. Some people say addiction steals souls and addicts are not happy. I beg to differ with that statement whereas each person handles their addiction or vices differently. I know many happy functioning addicts and I also know many miserable addicts. But the picture on the right you have a glow back in your eyes and that smile...wow!!! I don’t usually creep on people or comment on strangers pictures cause it’s sort of creepy in my eyes, but this is an exception! You just look so damn happy and full of life again!!! I hope you beat your eating disorder next, I have a cousin who suffers from body dysmorphia and hates the way she looks etc when in all reality she shouldn’t be ashamed of her looks (no creeps I’m not saying I think my cousin is hot!!!) however she is not ugly or need to be ashamed of her looks, and you TOTALLY should not be ashamed of your weight or looks either. You are beautiful and very well spoken from your posts! I hope you have found happiness other than at the bottom of a bottle or chasing your next fix....hopefully someday soon I can find happiness outside of pills and h congrats dude ! I'd bang em both.Your pupils arent pinned or anywhere near small in the old pic. You must not have been on opiates when that pic was taken.

Just somethin i noticed. Maybe thats the cause of the unhappy lookWhat's the dirtiest thing you've ever had to do for drug money?You look better hooked on smack, just sayin'diesbt seen kuje the same oersinDo they keep girls like you at na? I need to get out more! Congratulations on your sobriety, I too am sober and life is getting better.Are you really the same girl? When you was hooked, physically you still been so much pretty
:)  And first of all, congratulations in first place for 1 year sober, that is a really hard work. From junkie to preppie! Seriously though, you look great though keep up the good work!damn girl your looking really good!You look better in the first pic lol Idk I guess I'm biased cuz ur more my type in the first oneMan I always think the addicts are gorgeous, don't get me wrong I think you're looking a lot healthier but I always fall for the girls on the left.The one on the right is while on opiates, correct?Why do I like you more on the leftHaha sorry I know that’s fucked upNow this is what I call beautiful �❤Congratulations you look amazing You put on weight. Keep up the good work. Wanna make out?I’d make sober love to you babygirl ��Just about! Just hit 9 months clean today and 11 months sober from alcohol :)I couldn't be happier :) just gotta get my eating disorder under control and I'm golden ❤️Thank you!!❤️True.You're an inspiration and should be very proud of yourself! Stunning and the difference is astonishing. Less than a year! I respect the self-control and commitment to yourself to make things better. Looks like everything's coming up great. Never stop, never stopping! � Love these before and after pics, can see the life in people's eyes again. Sending positive vibes your way still, stay healthy girl!Thank you so so much!! Getting clean is one of the best things I've ever done❤️I'm 23 :)

Thank you!!!❤️is it a thing now that we call girls 'dude'? :DAmen❤️You've got this, I believe in you!

It's the same with any addiction, one turns into 100 and I refuse to go down that path ever again!

I'm so sorry to hear about your friend, I really hope they can get back on the right path❤️Yes! I got clean July 1,2018 :)It was crazy how quickly my color started to come back! 

Congrats on your year and a half, that's amazing! You're kicking ass!❤️It's like those before and after commercials. They look so miserable in the before photos. 

If they had the same facial expressions.. then that's the after I'd really wanna see 

AnywaysI haven't had a soul in years due to addiction, PTSD, and anorexia. I finally have my life back, I can finally smile and laugh and enjoy life! 

I do take Kratom to combat cravings and xanax for panic attacks (I have a full prescription from the beginning of February and it's one of the few drugs I DIDN'T abuse) but other than that, I'm free from the demons that were holding me back.

I'm so proud of you man, sobriety is so worth it❤️Meth is less cardio toxic than caffeine Pills, heroin, morphine.Thank you so much!!!❤️❤️You think I should post this on there as well?? I've never heard of that sub before!Thank you, love!!!❤️I take Kratom to help with cravings!
I also have a prescription for Xanax for panic attacks but I haven't touched it since I got it back at the beginning of February :)I could go for a cookie right now.That's a first! I typically get Penny from the big bang theory lolThank you so much!!!Thank you!!! :)Thank you so so so much!!!❤️

It feels so freeing and incredible! Words can't even begin to describe what it's like to be the person I am today compared to who I was a year ago. I smile and laugh without force, I don't have to hide behind a web of lies, my sight is clear.

I noticed the other day how beautiful the world actually is when it's not so blurry and unstable. I'm the happiest I've ever been and feel like I'm actually living after being dead for 10 years!Lol thank you!You're so kind, thank you so much!!!❤️ 

I still have down days, it's not all sunshine and Skittles, but I'm as happy as a clam 90% of the time ☺️There absolutely is, love❤️ it's hard but so so so worth it!To each their own☺️Hahaha how am I intimidating?! SameThank you so much!!❤️Thank you so much!!

It was pretty rough for a few months but now I'm feeling WONDERFUL! Congrats on 30 months, that's incredible!❤️I don't need white knights.

You're partially right, I did feel pressured to go to rehab and get better, but I didn't have friends swooping in to tell me to get help because I don't have any friends, I lost them all because of my addictions. Yes, my family pressured me to go to rehab but I'm the one who found the place and checked myself in and I stayed the entire time, even when I had the opportunities to leave early.

What I learned in rehab didn't stick because I wasn't ready to get better. I got clean on my own, for myself, because it's what I wanted. I was done with being miserable 24/7 and always looking for the next fix. I was tired for wanting to die all the time. I was ready to give up that life for a better one. 

I got clean 11 months after I got out of rehab and it had nothing to do with what other people were telling me to do. It was for me.Do you need a hug? I'm a great hugger!I certainly can be!Thank you so much!!

I get really excited when I get notifications :) I don't have many friends so when I have people to talk to, even if it's just a simple response, I get really happy!�Thank you so so so much! This comment made me smile like crazy!❤️ This is my favorite sub, I love how loving everyone is! I'll definitely be posting something when I hit my one year sober mark❤️I believe in you!! If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm a great listener! :)
And thank you so so much!!Thank you so much!!! ❤️Stay strong!❤️Thank you, I am as well!! :)Thank you so much! It is a sobriety post lolWhy thank you!You're so strong for pulling yourself back out of your relapse, that's one of the hardest things to do! I don't know you but I'm so beyond proud of you for getting your life back❤️

Have you ever tried taking Kratom? It's the reason I've been able to stay on track and also kick cigarettes and alcohol as well as drugs!

It's like we get a second chance at life!❤️ Again, I'm so proud of you, love! That's so awesome!!! Keep up the good work, congrats!!!❤️❤️❤️I'm 23!I lived in Connecticut for a little while but I'm a born and raised North Carolinian❤️People have said that and I have no idea who she is! I hope that's a good thing!
And I've been to rehab :) ???There were many reasons but the main one... I fell in love. I knew if I kept using, I'd lose him. So I quit the day of our first date and I've never looked back :)Yes but it wasn't all because of opioids! My sex life (up until now) was horrid and it ruined sex for me until I met my current bf.

I've noticed that Kratom doesn't really affect my libido but it does dull my senses.Thank you, Jeff!!!❤️A heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage. Heroin is a name for diacetylmorphine which comes from its sale as branded product by Bayer in the early 1900s.

Thank you!❤️Oh I know and I live in NC so there's just not telling what's gonna happen but I have a very reliable supplier who said he'd make sure I get my stuff even if it becomes scheduled :)Thank you so much!!! ☺️Thank you so so so much!!! You're so sweet!!❤️Addiction and anorexia have stolen over a decade of my life, I refuse to let them take any more!

Thank you so much!❤️Hahaha thank you so so much!!!❤️❤️Thank you so much!! It's all in my past and I'm never going back!❤️Trust me, you want to stay at the weight you're at because I'm sure you're gorgeous! I've suffered from anorexia for over a decade now and it's gotten REALLY bad since getting clean (gotta trade one vice for another, right? Haha). I'm trying to get my weight up because my body looks AWFUL (even though I secretly like it) and I'm so afraid my heart is gonna give out. Please don't go down this path, you beautiful soul❤️❤️Thank you so much!!!❤️Thank you so so so much, that means so much to me!❤️

I try to be the best person I can be to others, everyone deserves kindness even if you don't receive it in return! 

Your comment really made me smile ☺️Thank you so much!!I had more drugs in me than a pharmacy but I couldn't tell you what I was on when I took that pic. It was taken after my ex threatened to punch me in the face for drinking a glass of wine.Oh please. Quit with that shit. I’ve been using opiates for almost a decade and my pupils always look the same, opiates or not. Unless I take MDMA. Not everyone is the same and it’s ridiculous to think you can tell whether this girl was or wasn’t on opiates from her pupils alone.Cleaning the women's restrooms at the restaurants I worked at. God that was awful. Wow, what a shitty comment, just looking for some material to fuel your fantasies?  Why would you think this is at all an appropriate question to ask? [deleted]We all have our preferences!I'm not sure, I never really went to meetings! I thought they were quite boring lolHaha yes I really am the same girl! Just more lively!
And thank you so much :)Thank you so much!!!

I'm definitely far from preppy but I HAVE stepped up my style game slightly! Although, I say this as I'm playing video games in giant sweatpants and an XXL sweatshirt so... Maybe not �Thank you so much!!! ☺️☺️Lol you're not the first person who has said thatThe one on the left :/Personal preference, I suppose Not at all, we all have things that we prefer, that doesn't mean it's fucked up! Well, within reason hahaYou're so sweet, thank you so much!!!❤️❤️❤️☺️I lost weight actually.The fuck?Congrats on your personal 9/11!You don’t even look like the same person lol. Keep it up!Proud of you but the girl on the left is my current type.. I have a problem with being attracted to girls with drug problems.. lollllYou should be so proud of yourself. I know I am!Idk you but im proud! Longest ive gone sober since i started in 2010 was 7 months �. You’re golden anyways. Ppl always focus on the bad. You’re the champ — keep it up. You’re worth 10000000000x more than the drugs/booze. Always remember that.Ohh. Just saw this comment. Yeah. I bought 108 was very underweight... Please take care of and learn to love yourself, hun. �Your smile shows that! I wish you the very best, don't ever go back. It is a dark void that will steal your soul. It's taken me 20+ years to figure that one out! 

Live, Laugh, Love!Man that’s so young to be struggling with addictions � anyways, your looking good and you have a wicked future ahead of you hopefully � all the best bro ���I call all people dude or bro I guess, unless I know your name �‍♂️ nothing bad meant by it, but we are all the same in this gameOMG my clean date is July, 22nd 2018 <3 im right behind uCongrats! I got clean for a and a half. Had a relapse two months ago but better now. Ik smoking bud is a drug but i dont crave it like im a big pill head. Not into dope or speed or any thing. �  but good for u!Yeah it really is! Like along with color and some weight, one goes from looking like the living dead to actually looking human. Keep it up you're doing amazingly! 
& thank you :') <3I have bipolar type 2 with mixed episodes of psychosis, but I always know I'm in psychosis when it happens. Word up. My family's starting to be chill with me again but that took months, I'm not currently "employed employed" but I do legal odd-jobs. Addiction is the one thing I've found that logic doesn't work against. I was thinking that the only way to beat the game is to stop playing, in regards to this. Goddamn I'm stoned lol.I meant to say it was neurotoxic, not cardiotoxic. 

Hashtag high posting lolAnd your ROC? Sorry, I'm just curious because your story is remarkably similar to mine. I was just kidding; play on words for a less than savory sub of similar name.   Grats on the clean time btw; it's hard but also very worthwhile, I know.You’re truly gorgeous, I mean it. I’m glad you were able to beat the disease of addiction. Remember to stay vigilant and don’t get too comfortable, that shit is waiting for you to slip up and it’ll grab you and try to pull you right back at the first chance it gets. You have more time than I do so it’s nothing you don’t know already, but it also can’t hurt to hear it again. 

If you ever need someone to talk to for support on a bad day PM me and I’ll help you out. 

Keep pushing forward! We can only go up from here now that the worst part is behind us!!! (:oh wow that’s really good about the xanax. i can’t say that i would be as strong as u with that. lol. but it’s definitely something i respect.  i’ve tried kratom before. it actually worked pretty well when i had a lower tolerance. it was like a mixture of vicodin and caffeine but not very strong. it always gave me these weird herbal tasting burps tho. lol

anyways, i’m glad to hear ur doing well. it’s always nice to know that success is attainable. keep it up![deleted]Yeah ; i feel ya, Ive been 3 months sober and reality its life ; its like taking off that bandage off and watching for how it is ; feeling it for how it feels, life is a rollercoaster of emotions a lot of people don’t wanna deal with ; thats why drugs give em their escape im just happy you’re strong enough to feel the air again; to breathe and walk ; eat and talk without a buzz , yeah it can be harsh sometimes but it couldn’t be light without darkness right �� you woke up and i bet theres no one more happy than the inner you ; now keep the process of learning how to live with emotions ; with feelings; ups and downs ; but damn you made it out  alive and not a zombie anymore ✌���‍♀️ charge that spirit , good vibes ✨ i wish you the best you deserve it , i think everyone who’s been throu hell deserves a lil piece of peace ✌� LolIf guess he feels you are too good looking and therefore "out of his league".You're very welcome! You equated the relationships with your loved ones to be of greater importance than your addictions. Which is good, that means you're not a psychopath. Most addicts come to that same conclusion. 

But the thing is, its fucking annoying that people are so reactive to substance abuse to the point where they believe they need to step in. Because the ultimatum always comes to "it's either me or the drugs"

The culture has made that ultimatum the end game 9/10 when the reality is drug abuse and relationships are two mutually exclusive things. People should respect peoples right to use drugs and let them fight their own battles. But fighting battles alone is impossible so the threat of losing people is enough to force complete submission and allow others to "help"I really hate saying what I'm saying because I know its toxic and encourages relapse. I just know it's the truth behind addiction. But still, from the bottom of my heart I congratulate you on your sobriety. And I hope you keep it up. But It really saddens me when I see people holding a gentle sobriety on the facades others build for them. And it makes me prefer the misery of addiction 

Even though deep down I know theres a real life outside of addictionis that not what ur doing here urself lol Girl, a hug wouldn't come close to curing the depths of my spiritual malady. Thanks for the offer though.Put yourself out there bc with all the real stuff that I'm sure you've had to go through, you'll find friends in no time. Plus that smile will definitely attract other interesting people. Happy days ahead ��. Please be sure to let us know when it's officially your 1st year, you got this! No problem and thank you, that's very kind of you. I'm not much of a talker, I wouldn't call myself shy but more... closed off I guess. I do appreciate the offer though and if I ever do need to talk, I'll remember this comment. Congrats again on the sobriety.thanks :) i’ve never really tried kratom...just use minimal benzo/lope/weed for acute wd. 

This was just a few weeks of an oxy binge so i’m feeling wd, but not awful by any means. My blessing and curse is that no one really cares where or when i do my work so long as i produce...gets me in trouble. 

What made you decide to give up alcohol as well? I don’t think I could ever because of all the social stuff for work, but it’s never been my issue. It's a good thing :), she is very young, and talented singer. Check her out on YouTube. When the Party's over, or Bury a Friend etc... :) And I didn't mean you should go to rehab, I assumed you did ;). Was trying to tell the others out there that may read this :)[deleted]Maybe that was a backwards compliment. You shouldn’t hide your improvement with a filter, it’s disingenuous to your hard work. Be you, filterless, editless. �Might be your evil tethered twin 

(This won’t make any sense unless you’ve seen US)Of course! Very proud of your sobriety! ok well that’s good. I hope u continue to do good. and hit me up on here if u ever find urself feeling week and needing some help. i don’t mind. It is sort of odd to say/see, but the eyes are one of the biggest differences.  In the "clean" photo you actually look like you have life in your eyes, the "dope" photo you almost look dead-eyed.  I mean that as a compliment, while I realize the whole "dead eye" thing probably sounds more like an insult.You’re welcome. I love your attitude and the change in the pic reminds me of when I got clean. I was 6’2” like 165 when I went to rehab. I thought I looked fine, but I looked like an addict that never ate. Just wanted to show some support. 

And like I said don’t stop doing whatever got you this far. I eased up after a year thinking I was good and went on a ten day bender before finally getting it to stick. Good luck. You got someone rooting for ya in Texas. I was specifically talking about opiates with the pupil size. You coulda been on every other drug in the book and ur pupils wouldnt have been tiny (except for antipsychotics like seroquel. They also constrict pupils)

Meant no disrespect even tho that's what people always jump to. Even tho idk how me simply saying ur pupils werent tiny would be offensive.Its a known fact 100% that when you use opiates your pupils get tiny. Unless maybe youre doin meth or coke which make pupils huge.

I didn't mean any hate, i thought i clearly said im not sayin negative shit.  When i see a old pic of when someone was using ill check if their pupils are pinned.

Or if i run into an old using buddy i usually just glance n see if their still using or not by tiny pupils.

If i see an old picture of myself in the past 10 years ill try n see how my pupils look. Idk what all the freak outs are from.This is the internet.

People who think they can tell others what to do and how to think with the word "appropriate" are the biggest assholes out there.

Yes, I was looking for a good story.

If you don't like it, then fuck you.My ex was a cheerleader at an ACC school, 2/10 white knight harder.I can see you in your eyes :) Awwwe please don't think you're not beautiful clean because you 100% are I'm just a weird one. Now there'll be more than just scrawny white dudes with problems hitting on you! Congrats on 9 months though! Just picked up my 6No mam, you are the one who's sweet now. Are you clean now? Like never even feel like doing it again?Well you look chubby. Like just look at your face compared to the older photo?Just some super thirsty dude I'd guess.Hahaha why thank you!It was an inside job!This comment is ���Lol I like to think that's a good thing! You should've seen my face when I was drinking all the time... My cheeks were HUGE. I was 140lbs at the point, 122lbs in the pic on the left and I'm now 108lbs!I really am :)

Thank you so much!!!7 months is a helluva an accomplishment! You should be proud too!Thank you so much, love, that means so much to me!!!❤️❤️❤️Keep fighting, it's all so worth it! It took almost a decade of my life, I refuse to let it take any more of it!I started young but I got out young, I still have my whole life ahead of me❤️
Thank you so much, man, you have no idea how much your kind words mean to me!Yeah I'm 23 and going to rehab today for my 3rd time. 
Congrats OP! Nobody likes you when your 23 :(Well im 18 and addicted to oxyare you implying it becomes better for you/ easier when your older? �Congrats, dude! That's so awesome!❤️❤️Lol hey, whatever pays the bills, right?? I'm basically just a glorified babysitter that makes barely enough to get by (and I live with my dad, so that's saying something) but it gives me purpose and I love it! 

My family and I are finally on good terms, for the most part. they're still not happy with my eating disorder coming back but that's just another demon I'm gonna defeat!

Addiction is hell but you can pull yourself out, you just have to find that strength within yourself. People can help but you have to be the one who wants to be free❤️I'm so sorry, what does ROC mean?? What does the "C" stand for if it's "route of administration"? I've seen the acronym a lot and knew what it meant from context, but never known what it actually stood for.ROC? lolAhhh yes, I am very familiar with the Kratom burps lol, they're not fun! But it's the one thing that has worked EXTREMELY well for me! It even helped me quit smoking cigarettes! 

Success is absolutely attainable! You got this❤️I didn't ask you to care about me or give me attention but thank you for doing both by leaving a response �Don't hold back on my account, my sobriety is pretty damn solid.

You're right, a lot of people do submit to sobriety to preserve their relationships and that's when sobriety just doesn't work out. But that's not the case with my situation. 

Fighting addiction alone isn't impossible. It's not easy and it's not as effective, but it isn't impossible. You need to save yourself to actually get better, you can't wait for a "white knights", as you said, to come in and save the day. I really hate you feel that way and I truly hope you can find some light in your life to show you that sobriety is actually wonderful if you embrace it. 

I've been an addict for years so I know the truth behind addiction as well. I've relapsed more times than I can count. But this time is different. When you know, you know.

If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you. Again, I really hope you find hope, addiction is a dark and lonely place.No problem! I'll send a batch of cookies instead!❤️Trust me, I'm gonna make a huge deal out of it lol

Thank you so much for your kind words❤️❤️If you ever feel like the withdrawals or even the cravings are too much, I suggest trying Kratom. It really is a life saver! I don't think I could've gotten through WDs without it!

I can understand that. Idle hands are the devil's play thing, you know? But the fact that you're getting out of it on your own is HUGE! 

Along with being an addict, I was a huge alcoholic. If I couldn't afford drugs, I'd buy alcohol and get black out drunk (I've been to the hospital more times for alcohol than drugs) because I didn't want to be alive anymore. I quit drinking first mainly because my dad said it was either quit drinking or move out. Then quit drugs because I fell in love.Thank you!! I'll check her out as soon as I get out of work!❤️Ohh wow I'm a ding dong, I'm sorry!!

I completely agree! I went on my own, I wasn't forced, and it's the best thing I could've done for myself❤️ well, most of it. I did end up making a 6 month long mistake but I fixed that lolAhhh I hate to disappoint but I was just a waitress!All I can picture is Gemini from Binding of Isaac �Thank you so much, I really appreciate that! :)It's not an insult at all, it's true! Most of my pictures from before I got clean are hard to look at because I had zero life behind my eyes and they were just so dull.I'm so proud of you for getting clean! It's one of the hardest, most rewarding things ever❤️ your comments are so sweet and uplifting, thank you so much!!

You've got someone rooting for ya in NC❤️I didn't take it offensively at all! :)I'm a heroin user, my pupils usually only get pinned when I take a LOT. At my average level of high-ness - they're normal size. You have a weird personal definition of “known fact”.I never told what you could or couldn't think or do. I just stated my opinion, that it was a shitty question to ask, and pretty damn sleazy.

If you don't like it fuck you too! ;)[deleted]This made me smile :)I didn't take any offense at all! Everybody has their own preferences, who am I to judge? :)Congrats, love, that's great! Keep it up! ☺️I am 100% clean but there are definitely times where I get cravings to use again, especially when things seem to be falling apart, but I stay strong :)Thank you, I appreciate that!FIRE CANT MELT STEEL BEAMS!Outside jobHow tall are you? Np, it’s true. Keep it up, you got this!!!We're on the same boat. I started young (around 16) and i am almost completing 2 months sober (at 23 too). Shit's rough but we can do it! I dont mean to sound negative but don't go in with the mindset that you "got out". I was clean for 4 years and I started using again. I use to think this too, I started when I was 19, got clean at 20 and was clean until 24. It will be a part of you forever, even if you don't want it to be. Keep trying! You got this! You're gonna do great, dude! I know it's scary as hell but, trust me, it's so worth it!❤️Rehab doesn't work but take it slow on your next relapse 19 recovering from heroin here damn arent them pills like 35 a pop nowadays?Not implying anything. Just chatting to the young lady. Fuck off elsewhere if your trying to cause an argument ��That seems like a pretty cool gig. Ngl I had a free couple fat hits off the foil with bth a couple weeks ago for free and I did some fent last week so my long ass 289  clean streak is broken. I'm not too bothered, what's weird I still I really like opiates but they don't hit hard enough anymore unless I IV and that's risky business.Route of administration. So, did you snort, smoke or shoot your heroin? It was a typo. I meant ROALook into Beano (just get the large bottle walmart equivilant) it's a enyzme that helps break down what your body has trouble processing. For me it wasn't just kratom burps but full on kratom farts that were beyond awful.[deleted]It's good you were able to find a genuine comfort in loved ones over addiction. I know it takes constant work and that takes a lot of strength. It doesnt change the status quo, though and this culture is causing addiction to be as life threatening as it isWell good for you :) Luckily I’m not around a lot of supply so my main trigger is when it’s in front of my face, which is rare. 

Hope you’re enjoying your freedom. All good, congrats again, and keep it up. You're doing great, and look amazing!no problem. it’s not easy being an addict. it’s just good to know ur not alone in the world. You’re welcome! And I didn’t think it was possible, but after about 7-8 years I realized I had completely lost the temptation to use. I’ve been offered pills at work so many times, and I’ve had a bottle of codeine just chillin for over a year. Opiates don’t cross my mind unless I’m clicking on this sub. 

I find this sub helps me remember how bad it used to be. Be good out there, miss NC. Bro theres nothing to argue about. This is medically known for 100 years. Opiates cause pupil retention.  Then when you get about 18-24+hours sick your pupils get huge.

If your pupils arent pinned then your just not taking what your tolerance requires to get analgesic effects.

If i do 100mg per dose to get high, then i take 20mg, thats just not enough to account for the tolerance.What is that supposed to mean?  Do you also believe the earth is flat too? All opiates cause pupil constriction broYou just over here wishing you could get a girl under 200 lbs lmao

https://imgur.com/a/Ugc40usIt's a pitty that I can't saw it :) The fear was that I'd be interpreted as the judge, you the jury and the rest of this subreddit my executioner, downvoting me for my tastes. So you are my savior u/xpoloroidx, thank you.Oh yes, that's great. I never did drugs. Not even once. I wanted to do that but when I see people falling apart, I just back out and think about something else.How do you feel when you get cravings?? I hope I am not asking too muchYou look cuter in the first picture, maybe you should go back to opiates. *JET FUEL can’t melt steel beams.Actually it would be an inside job till the explosion then it would be an outside job5'5.5-5'6"! We got this! I'm so proud of you, 2 months is an amazing accomplishment❤️❤️[deleted]FOH.Honestly go fuck yourself, you’re no better than anyone else. 

/u/sausageturtle330 Don’t listen to this fuckboy. Get all you can out of it this time around and stay focused, maybe this time will be your last. Once you’re over the physical withdrawals, use that pain you felt as motivation to never feel that way again (assuming you’re detoxing from opiates). You don’t have to live the lifestyle that accompanies an opiate addiction anymore, it’s truly no way to live. If you need someone to talk to PM me. Take it one day at a time and you got this. Get it now while you’re young, we have the advantage over the old heads that have been drinking and drugging longer than we’ve been alive. 27, addicted to fent-dope (scramble) 5 gram a day habit20 addicted to IV meth/fentanyl late to the party but 19 addicted to oxy + fent. No such thing as starting too young.I buy 20mg for an equivalent of 0.6 dollars but im from czechiahahaha i was just joking, but jeez   your defensiveness  is real i didnt realize  you were a thuuursty ass nigga, i love when people expose thenselves for no reason whatsoever � 
anyways i wasnt looking for and argument  but you clearly are so ill just nip it in the bud. im sorry you were offended  by my joke thay had nothing to do with you,  i wish you the best , good day my friend.We all have slip ups, my man! It's not a relapse until you let it be. Just focus on the positives and see how far you've come. One slip up doesn't diminish all the progress you've made!Mainly shot and snorted, never smoked!Maybe that's why I'm so freaking bloated all the time... I'm definitely gonna look into that! I'm actually going to Walmart tonight so it's perfect timing! Thank you so much!!Three comments, that must meant you care A LOT!Thank you so so so so much!!❤️I'm not arguing the fact that yes, in general taking opiates makes your eyes pinned, but the point is that you can be an active opiate addict (and not in withdrawals) without your pupils being pinned 24/7. I've had enough today to stave off WD's and my pupils are just about normal size.   


To the OP: well done on getting clean. It's fucking hard and you look great now. [deleted]I figured as much :) don't worry, I'll even upvote you just in case!Not at all, I'm an open book!

I feel like I want to claw myself out of my skin, I can't think straight, my anxiety goes through the roof. I either get very frustrated or silent, depending on who I'm around. Sometimes I cry.

It's not easy, it doesn't come and go. When it hits, it stays for a while. But I push through and keep reminding myself of why I got clean and what I've accomplished since but also of what I could lose if I ever go back. Going back, even for a moment, will never be worth all that I'd lose.Absolutely, I'll get right on that.108 at 5’6”? That’s *fairly* underweight, sweetie... And your cheeks look fuller and more plump in your long-term sobriety photo, in all honesty... I’m glad you lost some of the weight you put on from drinking, but 122 is likely closer to an ideal, HEALTHY weight (body mass index) for your height. 
I’m just looking out - you need to keep your HEALTH as your first priority. At all times."First time" you're just proving my point. 1.6 years clean I just railed half a 30mg roxy and I feel fucking amazing.Yo why is everybody so fucking salty. Statistically we're all going to relapse a bunch of fucking times before we get clean. And its more likely you're going to have a life threatening OD when your tolerance is low. Trying to save lives here bro, sounds like your just regurgitating useless words of encouragement.holy sweet flying fuck! they are a dollar a fucking milligram here in america!Bit late but sorry dude. I was having a bad day ���Thanks for the words of encouragement and your perspective �As I said, your story is strangely similar to mine. I'm also a teacher, I'm 23, female. I started with pills as well, but tramadol instead. We don't get much oxy/hydro in the UK. sit on my face You literally just repeated what i said bro. 

If ur only barely taking enough to stave off wds, then you're NOT HIGH on opiates.

The whole comment was about the pupils being normal size which means she wasnt high on opiates in the picture.

Why are you still arguing about this petty bullshit?  Youre acting like a childBruh, you're homeless and beg people on reddit for money, the only action you've gotten in the last year is the time that crusty old homeless dude took advantage of you beneath that bridge you sleep under �Thank you for that
And I am really sorry that you have to go through this all. How often you feel this way?I'm just kidding love, you look healthy. 
Congrats. Yea, my anorexia came back full force once I got clean, unfortunately!

What's funny is, no matter how much weight I lose, I always have chubby cheeks when I smile �[deleted]Someone going into rehab needs words of encouragement. If you have the mindset that you’re going to relapse you’re obviously going to relapse. Relapse doesn’t have to be part of recovery. It usually is, but it doesn’t have to be. There was no need to be so negative, that’s not helping anyone. And it’s quite obvious you weren’t trying to save anyone’s life, you were just making a snarky comment that no one was having. They might be useless to you, but maybe he’ll get it this time, you have no idea if he will or he won’t. You’re just assuming he’s going to fail. You need to help raise people up when they’re down, not push them back down. Who cares about statistics.. honestly, if you want it bad enough you’re going to stay clean.nw hope ur all good fam, peace and love!Wow that's crazy!
I started with oxy and then basically took whatever I could once I spiraled. 
I'm in the US :)Are you clean now?You should play Dragon Age, you seem to be quite bored.Bit oversensitive aren't we? You're the one who took a good-natured comment and decided to take it as a personal attack and turn it into an argument �

Stating one's point of view is not arguing, and you don't need to have the last word on everything. It doesn't matter. Grow up. [deleted]Of course, love! And don't apologize, we all go through our battles, this is mine!

It's become more often recently, unfortunately. When I got clean, my eating disorder came back full force (cuz I just can't let myself be healthy and happy lol) and it's been causing a LOT of tension between me and the people in my life. Before I got clean, my way of coping with stress/anxiety was to use but now I don't have any vices, I even quit smoking cigarettes back in January. I'm having to relearn (healthy) coping mechanisms all while trying to get my weight back on track (I just keep losing more) and it's just... Tough. But I'll win this battle, too. I may be physically weak but I'm strong in many other ways.You're entitled to your own opinions, who am I to judge? 

But thank you, I appreciate itI’m sorry to hear that, sweetie. I’m going through something similar currently... I won’t divulge too many personal details, but you’re welcome to message me anytime regarding this, hun. ���

I also have that same problem, as well. When my now-fiancé first met me, some fat chick who liked him got hella jealous he has always ignored her and - in her mind - to top it all off, now he had a girlfriend! He posted a photo of us together at a huge music festival on one of our first dates. The photo was just us from the shoulders up, and my cheeks are really round. My dude calls me his “lil chipmunk” sometimes when he pinches my cheeks! � 
Anyways: this fat, crazy chick - who he wasn’t even dating or talking to, SHE simply wanted to fuck HIM, and that was the totality of the ‘relationship’ - had the goddamn balls to message him saying his “new girlfriend was FAT!” When, in reality, I was 135 pounds at the time, and she was over 200...Exactly. How long you been sober? who paid for your rehab?And you brother take it easy �I also have an eating disorder. Diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12. And I kind of recovered for a bit when I was 17, then slipped back into it when I was 20.No, definitely not. I'm going to order some kratom soon and maybe taper with that to get off the kit. only if we play togetherOk. Sure thing kiddo.  Obviously if you take minute amounts that isnt enough to effect you that you wont get pinned pupils.

If i drink a quarter of a can of beer then im still not drunk. Or if an alcoholic that drinks 30 beers per day, only drinks 3 beers one day, hes still not drunk even though a non drinker would be affected by 3 beers.

My original comment said that her pupils werent small in the old picture which means she WASNT HIGH ON OPIATES IN THE PICTURE.  What is the point of your peanut gallery comments? Dont you have to wake up for school in the morning? Go to bed already and quit the ignorant commentsOh now were getting all serious no more ��� emojis, im sowwy I hurt your feelings.Finally!! This is what I wanted to hear. No matter how bad the situation is, you just dont give up! That's so great and I am so glad that I could talk to you about this.  Just imagine the picture of the people when you get cravings, I am not sure but I think this will go away. You'll become healthy soon. You are pretty and you'll do great in your life. Someone said it to me "its okay to cheat as long as you don't make it a habit" I think you can sometimes smoke cigarettes or drink a little bit as long as it's just for fun. Btw what's eating disorder? And is it okay that we are talking all this in comments? I mean I could text you if it's okayMy only real opinion is that you look more healthier. Woowwww what a bitch, that's awful! I'm so sorry she did that! Bitches be crazy sometimes...

My boyfriend calls me Noodle lol

You're welcome me to message me anytime you want, as well! I'm an open book❤️

I hope things are going well for you now!Holy shit... My eating disorder started at like 10/11, I was diagnosed at 12, went to treatment 4 days before my 17th birthday, left 4 months later, and was fine until about 20. It started back up but was overshadowed by drugs and alcohol but has really picked up since getting clean. Are we the same person?Can you let me know a decent UK place for kratom? I’ve never found any reasonably priced uk stuff before.  Feel free to message me if you want to talk regarding recovery, I’m uk based and recent got clean myself, trying to keep straight and narrow. Absolutely.You really need to chill, dude. I don't know where you got the impression that my comment was somehow directed with hostility towards you, but it wasn't. I was just adding my two cents, because in your original comment it sounded a bit like you were saying that she was not using at all at the time the photo was taken.

Seriously, what's with the aggression? [deleted]There are definitely some people who CAN cheat but I'm not one of those people. I won't even let myself try because I don't want to risk all of my hard work :)

Anorexia, basically I starve myself so I can be as thin as possible.Thank you so much, love, that means a lot! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I always said, “Man, I could have a nice car with all the money I spend on my habit.” Now, a year clean., Content: , ups: 1027, downs: 0congrats dawg, looks clean as hell. Please call it your soberu. Please. 2015 WRXYooo, that’s clean my guy! This is motivating, thanks! Cool *and yet* still slightly sensible!! Good call OP
Congrats!Beautiful car and nice job staying sober man! Ya I like it.  Nice ride!One day I will sieze this victory! Congrats OPFuk yeah bro....now the dope man see you in a nice whip shooting the middle up as you pass[deleted]Sick whip dawg lol #jealous lol !��Was looking at the exact same car to get as my DD/Commuter..identical to yours.

Subie Bros! (Kinda, my girl drives a 2010 legacy)

Love her car in the snow, awd donuts are fun as fuck. Even though hers is the 2.5 you can get it to slide through corners on dirt roads no probif someone is in recovery and they don’t drive a subi, are they really even in recovery?

jokes aside, congratulations dude! i’m proud of you!schwet!Awesome. I got a car too...but it’s not picture worthy, only a 08 Prius

But boy I wish I had it when I was using cause it only takes like 17$ to fill it up and get 300-350 per full tankHell yeah, it’s crazy knowing I would spend like a car note on dope every day. The amount of shit you can afford when you’re clean is such a wonderful positive reinforcement.Way to go man! No bs. That's not an easy hurdle bro. That's so awesome! I say the same shit these days and decided today that I'm serious about kicking my habit. This post came at a great time, truly an inspiration, congrats!!Even if I gave up the habit. Which I have for now but its been on and off for a couple years now... I don't think I could afford this. :/ 
What do you do if you don't mind me asking ?
And how long did it take you to save up for it ? This is the kind of post I love to see!!! Apart from all the H and 30's but a fuck up story changed around! I'm trying to overcome all my addictions and get myself a Subaru! My dream Car man, Congrats ! YOU DESERVE ITBut also, if you are clean, isn't it kind of a bad idea to be lurking the opiates subreddit?

  
But in the back of your mind....maybe? Congrats bro!What is that, a Prius?now doesn't that feel so much better than a bundle of dope thats only gonna make you feel ok for a few hours or days... enjoy it man you EARNED that car!!!

Fuck yeah that's awesome. Congrats dude Well we have three or four, but still... not trying to deal with service issues on a new car. HahaCongrats! This is actually the car I’ve been slowly saving for, I make a good amount of money for my age I’m 20 and a area manager at a retail store so the pay is pretty good considering every manger in that store is 30+ so I know I can do this as well I just have to put in the hard work and dedication to stop my habit, 2019 will be my year (,:Hell yeah think of all the escorts you can fuck in thereI don't see  a nice car, only a Subaru??Gtfo with that positive shit.

You should install a Cobb access port �  Nice dude! Plan on doing any mods or tracking it? 


My man and I have a 07 Nissan 350z and ‘14 Scion FR-S; theyre our babies, I hope we can get clean so we can go back to modding our cars agains. 19 STI! These are fucking amazing cars ♡ 
http://imgur.com/a/m4HZLkfBeautiful carThis is extremely motivating. I am so sick of the chase, but so petrified of standing still. It seems a bit moronic that I tell myself I can't do it or don't have time because i have to be a mom. I can't take time for recovery because my kids would be without me. But, they are anyway even if I am present because I am not so comfortably numb anymore. I am more just surviving. They deserve more. Thank you for sharing your success, keep it up. I help lots of people stay clean and get help, but can't seem to help myself. These posts keep me motivated to do better Read the follow up post, fucktard If 951 has to do with the Porsche, you have good taste in cars. For that price, I'd get an older STI. Yes sir!Thanks!Haha. Thanks!Curious what a "car note a day" is? What was your daily habit costing at its worst if you don't me asking. Or what's the worst you've heard of. I think a lot of ppl in here hope to be clean one day...lol...I'm here, but started methadone almost 2 months ago....Yes. Sometimes. But in an odd way, it gives me my fill, or ill read about how sick someone is and I instantly go back to when I couldn’t get out of bed and cold sweats and shit. No thank you. Haha.Lol. Always.Haha funny guy[deleted]Get an older one. They're still dope. How much do you think you've spent total? Don't have a dope habit but beat a GHB addiction but that was relatively cheap. I'm always curious what peoples daily habit costs.Sorry bud, I’m loyal to only one escort. And she stay mounted on the dash on the lookout for 5-0. Lolahhhhh, the smell of a warm random shitpost that everyone will glance over...Sheesh guy.  I hope your plug comes through soon so you can relax.Auids are  are for peole like  you who are into schieza  porn and genocide. 
Subi gang!
GANG GANG! 
P.S this subi will %100 smoke ur little 1.8L 2003 A4 so calm ur tiny nuts.0ii6%=I own an 08, COBB stage 1. :) I plan on it.  Trying to still figure out what I want to do with it.  Exhaust, body kit, etc.Thanks!  Still trying to decide.  Probably the Cobb and exhaust.  Nice!! I like the STI[deleted]I think you should look at it the other way, you want to get clean *for* your kids. Don't use the short term pain/necessity of withdrawal as a reason why you can't do it. You can do it! and your kids will be proud as hell.I'm a mom too...I started methadone almost 2 months ago...I get what you're saying about feeling numb, and the guilt that goes with being a mom and an addict....Thank you for the kind words.  I’ll save the cliche words because you know them already.  You have to have a made up mind about it.  Part of the way I found success was because of my ego.  I always told myself that I had my habit in check, and I could go without if I wanted to, and by the time I looked up I was in a place where I was definitely not able to do that.  So I made up my mind, I’m not doing this anymore.  
Here’s a tip I will share.  Don’t bog yourself down with thinking about what you will do for the rest of your life, think about the next five minutes, then the next five, then the next day and work on controlling those, and you’ll be on a good path.  I used to scare myself back into it because I felt that there was no way I could live the rest of life sober.  Well you don’t have to, and you don’t have to think that way.  Find a little substitute, weed worked for me, and get going.  And before you tell me weed no longer gets you high, don’t. Haha.  Eat an edible, hit a gravity bong, get some CBD (you can order that online), and get going.  It’s too easy to get weed these days.  And trust me, I used to say weed didn’t do it for me anymore either, but that’s your opiate brain telling you it’s no good, I promise, when you’re sick...some weed will be your saving grace.  And it’s the thing that helps keep me in line.  Without it, (if I were trying to live the rest of my life sober), I would have fallen all the way back down to where I was.  Instead, I may want it some, then I just come home do a couple bong rips and it’s over with.  [deleted]Oh god no. Older means modded, no bueno. I was looking at a Focus ST as well but the R Golf was really fast. I was thinking of another M3 but I have an M5 and X6M already.Car bill a day maybe?Oh I’ve spent upwards of 300-400 a day. I imagine it’s worse for those with the means But that IS a badass automotive bro. I'm excited about this because I have nothing to show for my failures into rehabilitation.

INSPIRATIONAL YOUAt that high of a monthly payment he's definitely not putting a lot down or it's something he shouldn't be financing.i was just browsing, no way im gonna put almost 1k a month payment on a truck that wont hold its value over time, unless its a ford raptor (they hold nearly 90% of their value according to doug demuro/auto trader)

but i really love luxury trucks.... probably gonna go with an F150 with all the best options

and actually i was wrong, F150 platinum STARTS at 504$/month i thought it was much higher.... so probably would be close to 900 all together with insurance, after upgrades. Heroin addicts typically spend between $40-$200, sometimes less or more but that range covers most heroin users I'd say. The range being light to heavy use.

But prices differ based on tooooons of variables.I've been an addict for several years...and my addiction has gone up and down...but on average, I would day that I spent around $2500-$3000 per month on pills the past 2 years....it was a little lower than that over 2 years ago, but with tolerance and prices always increasing,  that's where I was at when I started methadone....so, in all....I'd say I've spent $70,000-$100000 on pills during the last 8 years. Makes me so sick to think of. I could have paid of my college loans with that![deleted]Id have went with an EV of any sort! Renewable energy all the way!    But congrats on your year clean.[deleted][deleted]It feels bad because I feel I don't have the right to stand still. I wish it were that simple. I want to be well for my kids. I am in hospice and moved, losing my care. No one will take me on as a patient in the place I moved. So, I am in forced withdrawal and can't drive the distance to see my prior hospice doctor. It was supposed to be all set up. These are the issues that go on in the world as all are well aware of, thus the steady increase in heroin use among patients and subsequent deaths as most of us have had no experience in it. I want to be present foe my kids without the unspeakable pain of the disease other than the dependence these meds put me into. I want to find something natural to help the pain my last time here with them, but i have tried most things. I want weed. I can't get it here. It carries the same jail time as any hard drugs. But, there is still hope. I am going to visit the methadone clinic closest to me. I hope they take someone like me. I hope they realize I am no different physiologically. That my body depends on this to be ok. I hope they realize I can't do this cold turkey and I can't do it alone. There is a stigma that patients can't get help in some areas because we were not out "scoring on the street" and it's not taken as seriously. I have been told to just suck it up by a few uncaring doctors or to drive the 8 hours every month to my previous one. It's a long complex issue, just like we all have our own story I guess. Yes, I want to be well for my kids. I don't want to be bed ridden from the pain of the tumor or the VEDS, and i don't want to be bedridden from endless withdrawal. I don't want to be a zombie either for the time i have left. I wish there was a middle I could find. Perhaps something that would not just mask the physical pain and let me even live a bit longer because they absolutely need me. I am a mother of 12 year old twins and have been fighting to stay alive since they were born. I have made it 10 years past what try thought I would. So, I know I am a fighter. And, all that i have been through should make doing cold turkey easy...but this is one thing that has stopped me in my tracks, has brought me to my knees, and made me feel like I would do anything just to make it stop. But, I am not doing that. I am locked in my house, have no car, I have made sure I can not leave to do something out of desperation. I came to this forum because more like it need to be in place. Someplace I can talk freely without judgment society often brings with such topics. I can talk to people who have been through this and down this road before. It is a comfort knowing I am not alone. 160mg of Oxy abruptly stopped with no warning was not how I wanted things just as I am sure anyone else in my predicament or other predicaments. The reason we got here in my mind is not of issue, the fact we are here is..and i appreciate your words. I have contacted a methadone clinic and am thinking about going for it. I am day two cold turkey and I know i can't do it alone. Thank you for your understanding. I don't know if they will help me or look at my case the same as I will in hospice care until I moved, where I have not been able to find continued care due to being new and all the regulations that have now passed. I worry about some of the repercussions of Methadone, which makes no sense in the reality of it. I just want some semblance of normalcy back. I need to work and be productive as long as I can. I need my sanity. I think I am just petrified to make the leap and worried what family will think. But, I need to do what is best for me and my kids. Thank you for your response. Sorry, but that went way over my head. What gen m3 were you looking at? And the golf was faster than the focus?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt. Car saved my life no idea what speed I was doing but it was bad enough for the front right rim to be sheared in half. Currently being fixed by my friends shop under insurance, he said the bill will be around ~30k.Exactly.  I bought my car with less than 20k miles and had to replace clutch and a few other things already.  Moral of the story is everyone rags out Subaru’s.[deleted]lol nobody cares about your follow up post, what are you bipolar? you obviously felt some type of way, go back to crafting those anal beads...Follow up post don’t mean shit if you are an asshole from the start. The guy has been clean for a min and saved up for something he wanted, then you shit on it. So who’s the asshole?I had a Chevy Spark EV. Actually a really nice car. Zippy too with 400 ft-lbs of torque. The only thing is unless you're driving a Tesla, your range is only gonna be like 100 miles if you're lucky, so you have to live in a city that has charging stations all around town, like a big California city, or Dallas, etc. Still, they're inexpensive to buy, cheap to maintain, and only cost like $30/mo to charge at home. Oh, my bad G.  I didn’t realize that was also you.  Gotta condense those comments haha. At least reply to your own comment lolWhat model? My recent “gift of sobriety” was leasing a MB C300 hah.  Whenever I bitch about the money I just think about how much I squandered on dope. * stock wrx 
That says it all put the money u spent on that audi on a subi+ less than half of the difference in mods and ur left quicker than a baby on a doorstep.will it smoke a tesla?Yes, you do. You have to take care of yourself first momma! If not, all else will fall apart.  Methadone saved my life.. Day in day out when I was using turned me into a mom my kids did not deserve and I finally went to a clinic and started on methadone and I was very lucky that it worked so well in such a short amount of time and didn't have to be at a really high dose, so my drug use stopped that week and I've never used again. It changed my life and my kids life. Everyday when I was using, even having a steady supply so I didn't have to be sick all that much, but I would get up in the morning when our alarm went off and my kids would get up and sit at the kitchen table to wait for breakfast.. And me? I had to go to the bathroom and do a line to get me to even function enough to get my kids food.. After they ate, they got themselves dressed for school and then watched tv for a bit before leaving for the bus.. While they watched tv I did another line dreading the walk to the bus stop. Once they got on the bus and I came home I spent my day getting high until they got home and days I didn't spread out my drugs good enough and withdrawal started setting in.

  


I was stuck on the couch watching the clock and battling the anxiety of wanting time to go faster cuz I was waiting for more drugs or couldn't get any and wanted the day to end, and on the other hand, I didn't want time to move at all cuz that meant me having to make dinner and give baths and just taking care of my kids in general and it took everything in me to do simple things.

  


I used to think God I'm so lucky that my kids are amazing and know how to do a lot on their own and they don't need me for everything and I can stay laying down and once I got clean and on methadone I felt so guilty for thinking that... I'm not lucky that my kids could do the things they did cuz I was either high or sick 24/7 and had a hard time doing things with and for my kids and as long as I did the absolute necessary things like feed them and bathe them and pay my rent, then I wasn't as bad as other addicted parents..

  


But that is not being lucky and my kids sure as hell weren't lucky!! They deserved sooo much better then I could give them and getting on methadone gave me a second chance to be the mom they deserved. Like you I couldn't leave to rehab and I certainly didn't have will power to do it myself and I stopped finding things I couldn't do and things that I kept putting off that I could do to help me and made my first app and it was the best thing I could of ever done!! Please please consider getting on methadone.

  


I know it seems like your replacing one drug with another and ya I guess it is, but there are many reasons to still go on it and any reasons you think are bad reasons to try it will never be good enough reasons to continue the path your on. Yes there are ppl who abuse methadone but those ppl weren't ready to change their life in the first place, so as long as your serious about it you can do this.

  


What ever your worries are now, trying to get your life back and move to a better path will be much easier to do when you stop using and you take something you only need once a day and everything that involved getting drugs and all the bs with it will no longer be something you deal with anymore and all you need to do now is what's best for you and give yourself a break and stop feeling guilty and let methadone do its job so you can focus you more important things!! Then after awhile and you feel stable and life is where you want it to be, then you decide with the dr if it's time to wean off and get fully clean.

  


However you stated your in pain and you were in hospice care, so methadone is likely even more right for you as it's very powerful and I personally know ppl on it that got addicted to pills and couldn't keep doing that but had bad pain and regardless they needed pain relief and methadone not only got them to stop abusing pills but it took care of their pain better then anything they ever took. So seriously consider it as it may work wonders for you, and again if you still want to find something for your pain down the road and get off methadone, you can do that but hold off doing any sort of weaning off once you've stabilized and your life is better in every way.

  


honestly if methadone stops your pain and works really well, it's not a bad thing if your on it for a very very long time. What matters is that you live the life you want to.. Someone with major depression that absolutely needs meds for the rest of their life to maintain a happy life wouldn't just not take their meds when it works for them and methadone for pain is no different.. If you get to be who you want to be and live the life you want to, and have it be pain free and stop using other drugs that can take you back down this path and that means using methadone for life/very long time, then why wouldn't you? Don't let the stigma cloud your thinking on this! It can absolutely give you your life back and could stop your pain so that you don't need anything else.. Two birds one stone lol

  


Also maybe look into cbd for pain.. I live in Canada and weed just became legal but before that I was always able to find CBD that has no THC and so many ppl swear by it for pain. I use it for anxiety and depression but it's supposed to work wonders for pain and it won't make you test positive for weed if you end up going on methadone and the clinic tests for weed. So that's something to look into.

  


If you ever need to talk please pm me anytime :) from one mom to another, I know what it's like to be done and wanted to get better and I did and so can you! You don't have to do it alone and there's no reason to do it alone when there are other ways that have helped thousands of ppl. Let methadone do its job so you can be the mom you want to be and get your life back and never worry about any of this ever again!!! ❤️I was worried about starting methadone also...mostly bc I have to go in every day but Sunday for my dose...and then eventually, over time, I will get more take home doses as long as I'm clean. It's just a pain in the ass....BUT it keeps me from messing around and selling my dose or taking too much...like I did when I was on suboxone. I've tried suboxone, cold Turkey, and even the vivitrol shot....but methadone is the only thing that actually feels ok to me. I still used a little for the first month....but I went from taking 250-300mg per day to only 60-90mg per day....just to help with some of the break through withdrawal symptoms...bc they start you off at 30mg and slowly move you up...now that I'm at 65mg of methadone I dont feel the need to use opiates as much at all...my cravings are way down, and sometimes I'll go awhile without even thinking about using....so far methadone is working the best for me...and hopefully I can stick with it! 
Good luck to you as well...it's hard, and you're right about the cold Turkey crap...its almost impossible to deal with and not use...the only way I could do cold Turkey is if I had no access to opiates or I was in a detox unit....Bicycles maybe?Have a 2014 M6 Gran Coupe myself. Don't have a dope habit but was addicted to GHB and passed out while driving it, right into a tree with no seatbelt.

Such a beast of a car, I went from a Mazda 3 to this with a akrapovic exhaust installed it sounds like a super car. 600HP Bi-Turbo.I had a E36 M, E 46M, but not the E92 so was looking at one if those. I would grab a nice E46M but they are getting overpriced now. Of course a Hellrot Red E30 M would suffice �

I need to drive about 50 miles one way into Miami  daily so i needed something quick, agile and really good on gas, oh and 6spM of course. The ST was nice but the Recaros were a no go. I am 6'1 250 lbs..I dont need AWD like a WRX, so i am trying the Golf. Damn, well those 6 series are heavy beasts with tons of electronics and safety stuff so no surprise it saved u. Glad u are ok. I almost wiped out a mom and two little kids so that was it for me. 

I was in a left turn lane waiting for the light and nodded out briefly. Well the lane next to me going straight got their green and took off. I woke up and just took off, of course my turn signal was still red� i turned right into the path of the Jeep and we missed each other by an inch.

That was 2 yrs ago this Nov. and i put to bed a 30 yr opi run.Yup, also there is only one Sub dlr around here and the service lanes are always packed, fuk that.I think when it comes down to it... It's a total roll of the dice on how reliable ur truck will be no matter what, they put together by humans and driven by humans, human error is prominent like I've seen brand new Dodge 1500 blow an oil line, 10k mile Silverado blow to tranmy, I've seen something drastic in all brands... None of those where in the last 7 years tho so it's getting better 
and then calls people a "fucktard" when telling them to read his bitchmade follow up post lmao, no wonder he stands alone �Hyondi has the Kona, and Chevy has the Volt or the Bolt  I think theres others. (leaf?)  lots are getting onto the 200 mile range now.  I personally have a Volt.  


Gets me anywhere I need frst 100km on electric, and about 500 more after that on the genie.  


I do about 60-70% of my mileage on electricity.Correct.  
  
 u/yttik822 , first and foremost, you must take care of yourself. If you need to take time to get clean and you have the chance, take it. Your family knows when you're not at 100%. Take some time for yourself to get there.  
  
I'm a mom myself, and gave up custody of my children to get clean and get a job. I know a couple other moms that did the same for themselves. Anyway, I've been working at the same place for three months, and I'm currently maintaining/weaning with suboxone. I'm not quite at a place yet where I could take care of my kids, but I'm trying my hardest to get there. You can, too. I believe in you! You can do this! Thank you as this is Information I needed. I was worried about whether or not it would help the pain from cancer. I know it's stronger than anything I've had. I have brain cancer and Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndome just to be clear so you know a little about me. A clinical case that scares doctors away as there is no fix, just relief until the day my body quits. I also worry because I need to get a job and it has to be enough to support a household if something should happen to my husband. He has carried me through the last ten years of surgeries and chemo etc. Otherwise, I have two Bachelor's Degrees and i accomplished them while going through all of this, but i am unable to work as sick as I am and half of that is even with my pain control, I am in too much pain. It's never been managed properly and I refused to up my dose higher in case I need surgery again and they can't control the pain as I am in this for the long haul. For me, it's not so much about getting "clean" as it is functioning. Not worrying if my insurance won't pay, can't leave town because meds are due, running a day short due to a bad day, etc. I could name all the reasons, but you know them as it's not different. I bought heroin once. I watch my friend shoot it and seize in my car. I ahd to do CPR and he almost died before I could get him to the hospital. But, that is how desperate I was to not be sick. Our insurance had changed and I was waiting on a preauth so I could not get my meds that day. Even after witnessing that, I still almost used it. It was by the grace of God, I flushed it and dealt with the withdrawal. If it can help my pain and it will not get in the way of rhe career i am trying to accomplish (there's not enough money in art and music for me) then I definitely am interested. Another fear, is closing the door to future hospice care should I find a doctor here willing to take my complicated case. If for some reason, the methadone would not work. I also worry as I am in an abusive relationship, if I left would my husband be able to take my kids. 

I also relate to your description of your day. I can't function in the morning. I can barely roll out of bed. It takes at least an hour or more to be functional. After 10 years, I wake up in full blown withdrawal, which should not happen on long acting meds. But, it does. I don't dream anymore as I don't go into REM sleep. I am perpetually tired. I can't remember as well. I am also very dependent in benzos. Those I never have issues getting though. Doctors seem to be less scared of them, but if you ask me they are more scary. I went a week without mine once just thinking i could...bad idea. And I don't even take all i am allowed to take as I hate nodding off. I hate not having control of my actions. It's why I don't drink or anything. Anyway, I will go. I only wish I had gone yesterday or Thursday as Monday seems forever away. I have Kratom. It helps a little. Not a lot. I used to have some great weed, it's all gone. Won't be to Seattle for another year so there is that. Here they have medical MJ, but it's not strong enough. Anyway, thank you so much and I'd love to talk more. It seems we can definitely relate to one another. And, for what it's worth, your story is inspiring to me.Yes, I agree, no matter the situation that ended a person hooked on opiates; whether it be illness in my case or other reasons, the outcome of not having them ubruptly is the same. And, cold turkey feels nearly impossible to me. I just wish i had gone in on Thursday when I knew I'd be dealing with this. But, even then I would be facing detox at home until Monday when a doctor could review my intake. I guess that is lucky though as in other places it can be weeks or months until someone can get help. In the meantime, bad things can happen. My heart is with anyone dealing with this on any level for any reason. The dialogue about addiction and dependence needs to change in this country. I hope it does sometimes. I wish you the best of luck and i am glad you found something that helps. This is so much more than needing a drug to function, it's a literal biochemical change and professionals need to realize it and treat it as such. I will know more Monday which route I am taking. In the meantime, I am taking the day second by second. No sleep in two days and all the aweful symptoms on top of the illness I needed the drugs to help. In my own opinion, it's so unethical for anyone to have to suffer like this. We don't let our dogs suffer like this. Why do we allow it for human beings? Take care. I think just talking on here and hearing that I am not alone has been one of the biggest helps. I appreciate it.Yeah, they're fun at hell! I used to actually be a BMW tech. Ah man, I love the 6spd e46 M3s,they're so dope. Maybe an S54 MCoupe clown shoe? Those are for fire as well. Yeah. The Chevy Spark doesn't take gas whatsoever. It's 100% electric, and is from 2014. The technology has developed a bit since then. I can imagine they're better than they were four years ago. Sorry I just saw this reply after I replied to your other comment lol.. Please go Monday.. Some ppl even get dosed the same day!Neat, but i need a DD/Commuter. A guy around me has a blue MCoupe, love it. His other car is a Ford GT.�It needs to be a four-seater? Yes, only due to i am a big guy and may need to run a 3rd person around. Iooked at the new Civic Si as well but that 1.5l is too small.

I looked a 2005 Z06 but it does not fit my mission. I looked at the Tesla Model 3 but holy shit $70k !!!!
I thought they were like 35k wtf ??What about a GTO? 

C5 ZO6 is fucking dope though.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😓💉🔫, Content: , ups: 1021, downs: 0You ever have a guy who can't make up his mind with this?

One time he barely exchanges a word with you while you're in some sketch ass parking lot, the next time he wants to sit in a Wendy's/chat for an hour & then the *next* time you come at him all friendly and he tells you to stfu? ���������Is anyone like butters from South park in these situations? Yes, I do believe I know what you are sayinglmaoThat’s really how it be to...�

Too fucking funny bro...����Thats why you meet at a store  or Walmart or mall.Real life! Ha ha ha... Real talkDidn't know Kurt was dealing by his own o\_o

&#x200B;"get up on the porch" said dBoy. This is a great picture though. That’s awesome as fuck. Although  the last dealer I had would let me use his bathroom to fire up. Then I didn’t care hanging out. Kurt’s like fuck Eric, I don’t want to hear about these bone thugs n harmony Right now I’m sick af! Is this a real pic or is it photoshopped? If its real this will be the second pic I've seen of Kurt Kobain hanging out with gangsta rappers. The other one was him sitting in a van with tupacI remember the days man... Lol. Damn i remember when i use to just hang with dealer for hours. He wven started calling me nephew because i went everyday and so neighbors wont get suspicious. You guys ever get dealers who leave you on read? Lol that shit kinda yikes.HahaLol one time i was coppin from my boy who was chillin with two bloods. We wound up talkin bout photo albums and the value of pictures to hold on to memories like pictures of kids and stuff. 10/10 great convoMost of the the time I don't mind chilling with my dealers, usually they let me get high inside, and are always passing around a blunt and/or alcohol, sometimes even a plate of coke.

For whatever reason I have never been treated like a fiend by my dboys, and seem ronalways garner their respect, resulting in great hood credit and short waits if inwait at all.Don't dip the pen in company ink��������Eazy E looks a lot like Michael Jackson pre-surgery.Lol sometimes the abundance of memes can be bothersome but this one is �I generally wont buy from someone unless I can sit and talk with them about cool shit for awhile anyway, unless I'm desperate and dopesick. Friends haven't fucked me over yet, but a rando dealer sold a friend of a friend a fat bag of fent laced heroin that would have killed him had he not done a small allergy test first. Be careful out there, kids.This made my day. 100%Too real���[deleted]Lmao that pictures iconic Whenever a dealer gets extra nice with me I know it’s because they just want me to sleep with them. The struggles of being an average looking girl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
This dude I’ve been going to for over a year is super super respectful though. Jokes with me, doesn’t get mad if I accidentally get lost, been to his house, met his family, even given him and his brother rides before. He’s never made advances at me and I appreciate it so much bc every other dude I’ve gone to has. 
So I guess I can say we’re friends? Whenever I’ve taken a break from using I genuinely miss seeing him haha. Such a chill dude and super down to earth. Lol cause the white boy in the hood, in clothes that don't blend in and his general look that stands out from the norm doesn't look suspect at all Everyone knowsThe funniest things are always true ! Kirsten face though I'd awesome ! I wish he was still alive !! Is that E and Yella? I hate it. Especially when I have an Uber waiting for me!!Ik, That's the irony This is gorgeous �That's the type that doesn't typically get caught. Constantly changing mo fucks with cops on your tail.dude sounds bipolar lolThey are not your friends why go talk to him like youre all homies next day after you were kewl with them the day before?..i also hate that shit when people try to be all kewl with their supervisors. I mean yes you want to kiss ass to be in his position. Especially when they cross the line. Not jealous,just know where you at,and your positionEvery. Single. Time.

It's a toss up between having to get into his car to either do a quick exchange or we sit and talk for 10 minutes. If not that we'll do a window exchange. Its different every single time and never know which method well be using every time we meet up Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, you don't have to keep asking. I never cop at Wal-Mart. Too much security and cameras. Restaurant parking lots is where it's at. You clearly have never had the luxury of copping in an open air. 

This is exactly the scenario every single time. Stairs and all.Or restaurant or store or mall.is it a real picture??  why would they even be chillin' together?? other than for some a-hole record producer to get a pic of his cash cows...Im assuming this is fake.  Ive seen one with him and biggie or maybe tupac in a van and its also fake but done very wellIkr like bro do you wanna make money or not??On read? Like a book? If so that must be nice,them giving you a book while your waiting Exactly and when you're chilling and they're smoking blunts you start working on cheaper prices for bigger quantities. Nobody was talking about having any sex with their dealer lmao You're doing something very human but also dangerous, you're attempting to create rules to follow to tame reality. This is the root and start of religion and superstition.

You should test your dope no matter the relationship you have with the dealer, good terms won't stop a chemical from killing you.Because it is? you dropped a \\That’s the jokeOr just sometimes he’s tweaking/coked up/drunk and has shit he wants to say I think maybe people enjoy being friends with people. What is the appeal in being on shitty terms with people you are constantly in proximity with? So u can maybe get on their good side for a potential hook up or the ever so rare and elusive *frontal of the bags*Not in the bathrooms Lol Walmart security is a joke though.I’m not sure. I mean All 3 of them are very influential musicians and probably had mutual respect for each otherThats the other one I have seen. I didn't know it was fake and always thought it was them being shuttled to or from the VMA's that year. Given that they were both big in the same decade that made perfect senseYo that pic isn't exactly fake, it was just cropped together to have them in the same photo, Kurt Cobain and BIGGIE were in that shuttle together. That means they're dry and waiting for the reup. At least in my experience. This is my problem all the time and it doesn’t make sense. You know they have what you want and you have told them you have the money and still they bullshit and take their sweet ass time . Like dude seriously do you want this money ? Because if someone else with shit just as good hits me up in the meantime , I’m copping from them ��‍♂️I know one dealer had magazines in his office, oh wait that was my doctor.I always test a very small amount of each bag before I dive in. I didnt mean for it to sound like I implicitly trust anyone who sells dope lolVery beautifully said.This so much. I understand we don't come from the same backgrounds, but I can guarantee we have similar interests and talking to each other for 5-10 min each day would probably broaden both our mindsets on the other person and their lifestyle/culture.Why consider your dealer your friend if you know he doesnt care about you and just your money. For the buyer   the only reason why  they would want to be friends is to get more free stuff. If possible. But you know that a dealer and a buyer wont ever be close friends.  Especially on a "business " that requires more cold heart than making friends by selling dope. In that case make friends on tinder.  For job being a friend with a supervisor is almost the same thing as a dealer. But the worker under supervisor wants a raise or if there is ever an opening supervisor would hook it up. This is where the saying comes in" is not how smart you are or what you have done,but how many people you know in the right places" i guess i see it that way because i went to school,i spent hours of the night doing homework to be somebody successful, never did i rely on anybody to get me where i want to be. Yes its nice having friends at work. But being friends with your boss ,to me it shouldnt cross the line. Especially if something goes wrong theyll tell on you.

TL:DR // dont expect somebody to get you or give you what you want. Dont rely on anybody {job} dealer only cares about his money and thats all (drugs) 

Ps. This is my opinion. Would love to have a friendly conversation if you dont agree with me on this Why not? My dude did that for a while. Lol it was always weird though. True that. Sure, but there's almost always a cop posted there, and if not, then Wal-Mart won't hesitate to call them. Plus, there are cameras everywhere. It's just not a good idea. may be true... but i don't really see "mutual respect" on any of their faces in this picture... do you?I wish it was legit that shit would be legendaryhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/kurt-cobain-biggie-photo-krist-novoselic-2072237Nah... Completely different whips. 


https://www.bananaklip.com/blog/kurt-cobain-2pac-biggie-photo-rare.amp[deleted]Acting kewl with my Dope man might not get me a friendship BUT I like to interact with them a bit beyond the handoff.  Especially if they're a new connect.  Mostly so I can get a feel for them and also it builds a level of trust.  Even if that level is tiny.  I like to know how the person im dealing with operates also so i/we can be safer about operations and avoid detection.I agree with not relying on people and all, but maybe the dealer thing depends on where you are and how your place operates.  I wouldnt try and make friends with someone in an open air market but where I am, you have to know someone and it helps to be friendly.It’s probably when Judgement Night soundtrack came out. All the grungers and metal doodz did songs together. Sub Pop SeattleDamn good article. Yea if Kurt hadn't been killed I really think music would have gone in a totally other direction.Thanks for that. I  glad to know you are one of the exceptions. And im sure theres more people out there. Not jealous or anything. Im just glad that you are ok and everything turned out better for you. Take care,and dont over do it (im no one to tell you that ,i know. Just mean well.)This was a good exchange and while I in some ways want to be friends with my boss I do understand that he doesn't actually give a fuck about me and would forget about me the next day if i got fired/left.  Dealers are different since they aren't paying you, its the opposite actually, so I can see and have become good friends with a dealer.  I mean at least with them you have a common interest and implicitly trust each other with some pretty illegal shit.  But ya no way I believe that I'm friends with my boss @@@@@@@@@@ Title: You were my best friend, Content: You were 14. You rode the bus home with us every day. We'd get to your house and run upstairs, only 15 or so minutes until your mom got home. We'd pack the bong, hit the patio, blast The Beatles and smoke until we were on the floor coughing. That 70's Show was always on at this time, right after Scrubs finished. We always talked about how similar your dad was to Red Foreman. We were young, high, and had no idea what the world had in store for us, but we were happy. Your house always had the best snacks.

You were 16. I drove us all home after school, and as always, we'd unload at your place. You and Marcus would argue over who'd roll today's blunt, and I'd sit back and laugh at how dumb the two of you were. Your mom stopped caring about us smoking pot, cause we were on the verge of young adulthood and both got accepted into the college of our dreams. Getting stoned wasn't quite what it used to be, as with all the pressures of becoming an adult, came unwarranted amounts of anxiety. We were also too old to act the way we used to when we got high, something that really only seemed to affect me because you were always so damn mature. I hated that. Your cousin sold us some xanax, and we'd split one into three and drift away. For those couple of hours we were untouchable. Nothing mattered, we were the only ones who existed. We couldn't imagine life any other way, why bother? Nobody could tell us we weren't living life exactly how we were supposed to.

You were 18. You finally had set up our dorm exactly how we envisioned; TV's facing opposite direction so screen-looking was a thing of the past, microwave on top of the toaster oven on top of the mini fridge, a drawer full of weed paraphernalia and 7 posters of our favor artists, movie scenes and cliche college quirks. You passed me the straw as I broke my roxy in half, pieces flying everywhere that I would eventually try and find later.. You were more accurate then you thought your were when you would joke about me doing that. I'd separate the big, fluffy line into three smaller ones, and you'd suck yours down all at once. My tolerance was the same as yours was, but I lacked the $200 check you'd get from your parents every Monday. I was always kind of annoyed by that, but you'd occasionally show my broke-ass some love. Me and my girlfriend were fighting, and it got so bad that you drove me 400 miles to see her while your car was literally falling apart every step of the way. Your parents were so pissed that you drove while your car was in that kinda condition, but you told them it was something you had to do. It actually hurt you to see me cry, cause it was something you had never seen me do in the 14 years we were friends. Your transmission was replaced and your parents were $2400 poorer, but we were on our way back to school. You had just affirmed yourself as the most caring person in my life. My dad had passed and my mom was back in France, but I had you.. and for that I was pretty damn lucky.

It was your 19th birthday. It was my birthday literally just the day before, and we would always celebrate them together. You walked into the dorm and I pretended not to notice you, which had recently become the norm. I had the funniest story of this failed attempt to spit game at some girls after psych class, but I knew I'd be saying that for someone else. We had stopped talking for about a month now, due to your stubbornness and my inability to break a grudge, regardless of how petty it may have been. You were wearing long sleeves in July, but I didn't notice. You'd sit on your bed and watch ancient aliens, and I'd find some excuse to leave the dorm. Your presence drove me mad, as I'm sure mind did yours. Truthfully, I don't think either of us knew why we were fighting, only that we were and that any attempt to act otherwise would make us look weak. My connection to all things opiate were officially cut off, but yours only grew stronger. After a fun week of dope-sickness, I finally started feeling like myself again. The benzos would kick in, and I'd head out to my new friends house. We'd hit every club, every big sporting event or social gathering we caught wind of, so we could take dope photos for people to admire on Facebook. You'd sit at the dorm, and watch ancient aliens with the lights always off.. No matter what time I'd come home, you were at the dorm watching that damn show. I brought some girl home one night, praying that you had found something else to do. You hadn't, and I officially had to take her somewhere else. I made sure to be as loud and obnoxious as I could while grabbing my shit, ensuring that you acknowledged my presence and current lifestyle as better than yours before walking out. It still hurt to see you like that...
You said nothing. You were still wearing a long sleeve shirt, and I still hadn't noticed.

You were 22. You were outside of the gas station when I drove up, smoking a cigarette. You were bench pressing 185lbs at 14 years old our freshmen year of highschool, and here you were a senior in college looking like you weighed maybe a buck twenty. Your skin was pale, and the bags under your eyes hung about as low as my thoughts of you at that time. I smiled and you smiled, but we had nothing to say to one another. We were strangers, and we both had very different things to do. I saw you a couple weeks later, and I was pretty drunk. You looked even worse than you did the last time I saw you, which had to have been a hard task to accomplish. I was worried. I spent twenty minutes lecturing you and trying to mirror your image onto yourself so that you could see what I saw, but it was hopeless. You didn't see the issue, either that or you were too far gone and refused to acknowledge it. The kid behind you was sketchy and hung around you like a shadow, stepping in when I started to get emotional. He told me to fuck off, and I blamed him for destroying my best friend. The drunken tears started to fall, but my friends in the car were yelling my name. The tears were wiped away quicker then they fell, but I know you noticed them. Your friend laughed, but you didn't. I still cared, and you did too.

You were 23. Your oldest brother had received his sentence, and would be doing 17 years for trafficking, possession and selling to an undercover. Your younger brother still wouldn't talk to you. You had just gotten out of jail for violating probation, after getting caught stealing a drug test at Walmart. I heard the news and almost laughed, I couldn't understand how far you had fallen. You were always so much better than me in life, it was unreal to see how things had changed. I had my degree, a good job and a support system of friends that held through everything. You had a criminal record, a pocket full of pills and contact list full of people you either bought drugs from or sold to. I'd see you occasionally as I drove to work, and every time it was like seeing a ghost. I had no feelings for you anymore, no judgement. My painkiller habit had picked back up, but for some reason I still felt above you. I ended up running into you a few weeks ago, while I was picking up a few oxy 30's from my dude. You seemed almost excited that we were back on the same plane of existence, but I was disgusted. You tried conversing, generally interested in how I was, what I was doing these days and how my mom was. My answers were short, and I couldn't get away from you fast enough. It was obvious, and it didn't take you long to notice. You had fallen pretty low, but you were still as conscious as ever. I watched you take a long drag of your cigarette as I pulled away, staring directly into eachothers eyes. We were officially on two different planes of existence. I had no business on yours, and vise versa. This was the last time I ever saw you.

I got the news today. Your name and face was plastered across my Facebook wall, where every memory and funny instance with you was on full display. I considered writing my own status in your memory, but I couldn't. It just didn't feel right after all we had been through, and how I had treated you over the years. The cause of death wasn't broadcasted, but it didn't need to be, I already knew. Though it feels like 10 years since I've spoken to you, I can't help but think about all the time we spent together. Every minute of my life from 7 years old until 19, involved you in some way. You were the kid who I experienced life with, who I made mistakes with, who I got my first kiss next to.. You always gave me shit for having my eyes wide open. You brought me to parties, you fought alongside me, you accepted me as a brother and let me into your family when I felt like I didn't have my own. You cheered for me when I won, cried with me when I lost, and threw up with me when I was drunk or dope sick. You cared about me, through everything, and I threw you out of my life when you needed me the most. You never needed me, you were always the one I relied on for anything I went through, but you were always okay. When the time came that you weren't, I no longer had a need for you. I abandoned you, and you still forgave me. You still sent me invites on Xbox live, you still told funny stories about me with mutual friends and you still told your parents about all I had accomplished. You still gave a shit, you still cared. You were no longer a part of my life, but I was always a piece of yours, just a little lost along the way. You were the greatest thing I ever gave up in this lifetime, I'm sure of that.

You were my best friend. , ups: 1015, downs: 0Jesus I did not have a signed permission slip for that feels trip.Fuck man that was beautiful.  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss. This was beautifully written and inspired me to reach out and bury the hatchet with someone I haven't spoke to in six months I am actually hysterical in tears right now. that was such a beautiful, eloquently written story. thank you so so so much for sharing...

I am deeply sorry for your loss. your words make me mourn right there with you. this cut me deep. a feeling all too familiar... rest in peace.

sigh.Story hits so close to home for me, it was almost scary to read that. My best fried passed away from an overdose 5 years ago. We had always been on the same playing field when it came to drugs until one day he passed me. I was still addicted to roxys but thought he was so much worst off than me. Everyone knew what he was doing and how he was falling fast but did nothing. I tried to help him out and let him stay at my house but kicked him out when I found that he shot up in my house which was so hypocritical cause I was still getting high just wasn't using the rig yet. I kicked him out. The last time I saw him he was with my dealer and he looked terrible. We exchanged awkward what's ups but I got out of there as fast as I could. All I could do was text him and tell him he was better than that's so needed to stop. A few weeks later after that I got a text saying he was dead. I didn't even ask how, I already knew. I could have done so much more to save him.

 Fast forward almost 5 years later and I've become a heroin addicted over the last 4 years. Shooting up daily for a year and a half and screwing over everyone I knew. I've been to rehab and halfway houses and still havnt managed to string together more than a few months. Now I have friends texting me saying I'm better than that and need to stop.i think back to my best friend and I'm exactly like him, it just took me a little longer to get there

 Addiction is hard and scary thing to see someone go through. Most people don't know how to confront it or feel to uncomfortable to do anything about. Sometimes it's easier just to block it out and move forward. The person addicted is so caught up that they don't see all the obvious signs of how close to death they are that everyone sees. I'm lucky to have a few friends and family show me how close I was to death and all I can do now is do everything I can to stop and accept their accountability. 

 It may sound cheesy or the situation may seem uncomfortable but if you see someone you love get that close to death do something about it. My biggest regret in my 28 years is giving up on one of my best friends and after 5 years I still think about it all the time. 

Sorry for your loss OPThis might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on Reddit.  
May he RIP.Damn man

Nothing like this to remind the human race that grudges and long term anger situations benefit absolutely no one

I'm so sorry about your friend, and I hope you are able to find peace sooner rather than later in this situation. It's not your fault, i know this is insanely more easy to talk than to act but try not to live in the regret over lost time. That existence will never let you move forward with life

Your friend would want you to keep going, to keep succeeding 

.I'm so so sorry for your loss ❤️I'm sorry for your loss. This shit is too real. Brought me to tears reading this :'( rest in peace to your friend, he sounds like he was a good personIt's so lame and cliche... But that really just brought tears to my eyes. Big hugs dude.condolences my friend. don't let your relationship at the end depict how you think back about him though. pm if you needa ear Ow. Holy shit.  This was amazing, I'm gonna hug my friends more often.this really touched me. i'm so sorry about your best friend. i see myself in your best friend, but i also see myself in you. we all have so many flaws. forgive yourself. if nonody told u today, i love you bud.This is so human and a wonderful, sad, beautiful, read.  Thank you for sharing this story and I really hope you will go easy on yourself.  It is really affirming to see such great people do exist and in so many of us.  We all have such suffering and it is so bittersweet to see what good friends you were and the reality of how our lives can go.  When my wife gets home I will definitely share this with her and others.  What a write.  Take care.Fuck this got me. It was good hearing from the other side. I have a neighbor friend i went threw everything with since the age of 5. Halfway threw college tho it became clears drugs weren't just for fun anymore and were part of my life. I've lost so many friends and have spent months being along since graduation. Everyone else having girlfriends and life and me stuck in the same day to day grind of just focusing on getting high. 

It was good to read this and see from someone else's proseptive.The was gut wrenching.....but such a beautiful tribute to your friend and to your pain. Thank you for sharing.I'm in tears. I am so so sorry. Maybe you could do something to honor him in some way. Although I think you just did. Oh man this hits home. I'm sorry to hear about your buddy. But at least you realize the treatment you gave him and have paid your respects.

Keep truckin buddy. Nothing I read on reddit has ever made me cry, but two years just fell down my face after reading all of that, and then that last line. That last line just did it for me.

Guys, the takeaway from this is to cherish your loved ones and your friends. ALWAYS.

You simply do not know how much more time you have left with them.I'm sorry man. Don'the be too hard on yourself.  It sucks but it's not your fault God damn this Reddit post is right in the feels Condolences...

I do not envy the endless amount of nights this shall keep you awake, in tears.This is beautiful. I am so so sorry for your loss. please do not beat yourself up!  Take this and learn from it. RIP dear friend. I could barely read the end of that through the tears. That was beautiful man im so sorry. I can relate.Damn.This one hurt. I saw myself and friend in this too a tee, from the beginning to when you got back into pills. The only difference is that after many rock bottoms, my friend cleaned up, and I was a the fucked up one now. I ignored him for so long to "focus on my sobriety" that now that he is clean, and I'm the fuck up, I can't bring myself to reach out, because I know he would accept me even when I wouldn't do the same for him when I was clean. Our mutual friend ODed a few weeks back, and I couldn't even walk up to him at the funeral, even though it was always the three of us back in the day....

Good writing draws the reader in and makes him feel like he is part of the story, and fuck if you didn't pull me in. Sorry for your loss homie.this story broke my heart... I hope all of you struggling with opiate addiction get help and get better pills are the worst. Sorry for your loss. What kills me is reading these types of stories that all start out with... We smoked pot a lot... Then leads to one of us got addicted to xyz drug... But people still get upset when you say weed is/can be a gateway drug.Opiates fucking fucking suck man. This has me crying thinking about the people I left behind when I moved across the country to get away from the habbit. I talk to my ex occasionally. And every time I tear up hearing how she still is shooting the shit. And I know it's just going to be a matter of time before I hear the news I don't want to hear. I'm sorry you lost your friend. Some people get hooked and stay hooked, some people get hooked and get out. Both sides end up losing something.damn that was a sad/good readWell-written reflection. The best of luck to you -- death that goes by with someone who one has not reconciled with is always difficult This may sound stupid... But was it a H overdose?Damn... that was deep man. Deep as fuck...



RIP





I know it is cliche but it is fucking true. You never realize what you have until it is truly gone.Oh god I'm tearing up. 

God fucking dammit this was beautifully written. I'm so sorry, OP. I'm so sorry. Here's to hoping you find peace. As someone who has lost her brother and cousin all I can say is don't give up on yourself!My heart breaks for you. I wish I could find better words but this post destroyed me. Take care of yourself man. Hauntingly beautiful. Sorry to hear this mate.FUCK I was not expecting to cry tonight because today as such a marvelous day but fuck this really hit me. I'm so sorry man. May he rest in peace. I've lost 4 best friends which includes my baby's mom due to heroin. I really feel your pain, trust me. Keep doing well. You've seen enough to help you, we all wish you the best. I saved this story to show to others, I hope you don't mind(I mean it is on Reddit). Hopefully your story will show at least one individual the right and wrong paths that are there to fall into. Super relevant to my life right now, thanks for sharing! And sorry for your lossHoly shit man. Wow. This one really hit me. Sorry for your lossWow, this really struck a chord with me man. I lost one of my best friends to U4 about 3 weeks ago, and of course his fucking funeral was on October 7, the day that toxic fucking garbage was finally scheduled. Seeing his sister and brother-in-law and realizing I was probably the only one that knew exactly what happened still haunts me to this day. They knew he OD'd obviously, but they have no idea about RC's, especially not U4. Every time my phone buzzes in the middle of the night, I still think he's sending me a link to some random youtube video, every time I go to make a call, my fingers seem to automatically gravitate to speed dialing his name. I've been mostly clean for a couple years now so I don't come here or post nearly as much as I used to, but I needed to let you know that you're not alone, for better or worse. Knowing how it feels to lose someone, but to a more traditional (?) cause, this makes me feel quite sad. Also, excellent writing.Man that's a great story/lesson/writing, I think I gotta call a buddy.... I hope others do the same.Hate to be the one but sounds like after the fact you're just trying to make yourself feel better about yourself, would have mattered a lot more if you came to all this before he died, and actually tried to help him.  Sorry, but seems that you just got the lucky end of the opiate trip and he didn't.I swear to god I'm just cutting onions.

At workHaving falling outs with best friends is the worst... I feel like this has happened to me way too often, and maybe I'm the problem? Anyways, I'm so sorry for your loss. What a horrible feeling. FuckI'm crying, i can't even imagine how you feel...

I'm really sorry.I didn't think I would tear up but I really did. I'm so sorry man.
Wow. This is a very well written piece of literature. I can relate to both sides of the story. Which makes it hit home all that much harder. I hope you don't blame yourself, and have the capacity to make peace with the love/lost. So many grammatical errors in this wall of drivel. Sounds like you made the right move cutting the junkie out of your life, congrats � now it's time to take life by its dick and stroke it till the cows come home � � [deleted]That is amazingly well written.  I connected with a lot of the things you said.  I have a feeling we are pretty close in age.  Everything you said about the college days and the falling out hit so close to home.    
       
Except I am your friend.       
         
Luckily, I was taken out of the life of addiction and am now in recovery (214 days clean).  I was forced to drop out of college when I went to jail and then to a CBCF instead of prison for my felony.  I am now back in school and will graduate in May.  I feel like this story hit so close to home because if I wouldn't have slipped up and got arrested, I would more than likely be in the same place as your friend.       
       
I often wake up to things on Facebook very similar to this.  Just last week a decent friend of mine, that I hadn't spoken to since I took my "vacation" from society, was the latest to lose the fight against heroin.     
        
If I were you, I would use this tragic loss as motivation to get your life on the right track.  I'm not saying sobriety is right for everyone, but at least take a look at what you are doing and where you are going before you end up in the same place as many addicts before us.  Good luck and stay safe.OP from what I've just read, it sounded like you were a total asshole to him. You looked down on him for becoming an addict while you were doing the same shit, just at a different degree. He didn't steal from you, didn't start shit with you or anything like that. God forbid he stay home the night you decided to bang some slut and couldn't handle somebody else being there. You laughed at him when you saw him in town and and when he gets arrested. He tried to talk to you and reconnect and instead you blew him off after you got your drugs because you just could not be fucking bothered. That's all you cared about.

That's not how you treat somebody you call a "best friend". 

Maybe we just feel differently, but I never gave up on my friends. especially one that drove you 400 miles to see some bitch while fucking his car up in the process, just for your sake. I would help my bros hide a fucking body if it came down to it. 

This may sound harsh, and I don't know the whole story, but I feel that you completely failed him as a friend multiple times when he probably needed you the most. Regardless, he's gone now. My condolences to you and his family, may he rest in piece.
 So sorry for your loss I can never bring myself to read these am I dead inside? Oh sweetie. I wish I had words that would help you. But there are no words. But I understand your pain. My heart hurts for you.
Hugs.Sorry for your loss.Someguy did a spot on parody of this IN A new Post. Op on another note I truly feel for you and hope writing it all out helped even a little bit.THe parody is greatwhy did i read this.... damn...I lost my best friend to heroin too. I know them feels.fuck man this actually brought a tear to my eye, having lost a friend of 16 years as well. but from being your best friend at 18 to hardly even talking to each other or acting like friends at 19? yea, i definitely think there was something fucked up going on in between there you didn't mention, especially if fighting with each other was really the norm.

 to me, it seems like your friend started banging dope in the dorm room and from there it got worse and consumed him. I'm pretty sure he still cared about you all the way up to the end though. your VANITY consumed you which led you to drop him as a friend during what was probably the worst part of his life. i can't really say you're the good person in this after reading it twice. My best friend died while we were distant and most of our contact had been tinted with my shitty attitude about him using. I hated that he was still doing it and I had a terrible immature way dealing with it. I never got to say goodbye and it still just fucking kills me sometimes. I miss my friend so much. Fuck. :'(

I also kiss with my eyes wide open, btw. Always have. Weird.Just coming across this and wow. How hard your post hits home brings shivers. 

Brother I hope this friend forever lives on in your future life experiences and pray your intimate story may save even just one soul falling down this terrible path.

Thank you for writing this. I do believe what you have said here will help remedy self-destructive trust issues with friends, new and old, and help my ability to understand and empathize with persons I no longer know anymore, but who I once felt were one in the same with me.

I never could wrap my head around the relationship with my high school best friends. Our group of 3 was the closest friends could be, yet evolved to become the persons we would fuck over, and hurt, the most. I always just thought that we really never were "actual" friends... at least not how normal people's friendships were. We all had such fun---the time of our lives---but none of that mattered anymore. this is fucking brutalHoly fuck. Man... um... shit.... hmm... uh.... Jesus Christ this is powerful... I just. I don't know... wow.Wow I can't but be sad for you and hate you a little at the same timeImagine how many upvotes you would've gotten if you were actually a good friendtruthfully that is all i can ask for in writing this. i really appreciate itFor real though. I miss my dead friends... anyway, how are you? still  withdrawing? I get so emotional and forlorn when I'm sick. I read that with one eye while nodding out a couple times and it still brought me to tears. Right?i cant agree more. i know that if i went back i could rewrite his fate, i have no doubt in my mind he'd be alive and we'd still be best friends. that's the hardest part about all of this. they say things happens for a reason, and i guess sometimes even the most terrible of occurrences are meant to teach us lessons we could never learn any other way. all i can say to you is please man, please make the changes you know that you need to make. we all see ourselves through this golden filter, where things seem so much better then they actually are. your friends see you for who you really are, listen to them.. not to sound corny but there are so many people who care about you, including me This is the most beautiful thing I've seen.  Wow.  May he RIP.  i will admit that i am not the most complex of minds, it kindve just came out the same way the thoughts occurred. i thought the same thing after i wrote it, but its more a memoir to me than a piece of writing. i do appreciate it budStrangely I understood the misspelled words you were trying to type. The whole point of this story was a release for myself, to let out all the guilt Ive felt since he died considering how I could have saved him by being a better friend. Saying I'm trying to make myself feel better by talking about how shitty I treated him doesnt make much sense now does it guyThank you friendWhile I completely agree with almost everything you stated about the original post, the last phrase I would use to describe it would be "heart-warming". IMO it's more tragic, sad, and heavy than anything, but that's just my opinion and how I interpreted it.[deleted]Thank you brotherOP took the time to write honestly.  I have a lot of respect for that.  It seems like he is quite aware of his failings.  He had the balls to write down the reality of the situation as he sees it.  There are some shitty people in this world who never admit or acknowledge any wrong doing.  This doesn't seem like OP.  He seems to be learning from life, and that's the best we can do.  You wouldn't be able to call him out if he hadn't directly written what he did that was not great.  Come on guy, go easy huh?Dude stopPeople often tell themselves they are "better" than someone else for not using the same method to get high or they are able to maintain a job and some degree of normality in their life.  I have a hard time believing that in all of your years you have never done this exact same thing; writing someone off and then having a change of heart later.  People make mistakes, and OP most definitely realizes he made a mistake and cannot change it regardless of how hard he may try.  There is a time and place for comments, both good and bad, however I don't feel like this is the time for a comment like yours.  OP is looking for support, and if nothing else, he is going to be the reason that one of us reaches out to a friend that we have done this to and that is reason enough for OP to post.I think you missed the point of the post. OP is admitting to being a shitty friend and feeling bad about it. Why kick him while he's down?It's perfectly alright to give up on your friends.   Especially if you are still dealing with the same issues they are.  Life is not about being crabs in a bucketi just read it, i dont know if hes joking or if i genuinely pissed him off. i guess it was a bit of both. honestly though i didnt see it blowing up the way it did, it just felt nice to write it all out like thatNicely said. I claim to be everything but the good person in all that had happened, writing this to myself was the most honest way I could think of in processing what had just happened. I had no idea anyone would give a shit or even bother reading, it just felt like a journal entrythe fact you think any of this was about upvotes just shows how big a tool you really arePeople don't change unless they want to change. I think he meant the phrase "brought tears to my eyes" was lame and cliche. Maybe? I didn't find the memoir to your friend lame or cliche at all. Beautifully written. Sorry for your lossExactly, you're just interested in making yourself feel better.  Sounds like both before and after he died you were mainly interested in yourself.  Just calling it as it is.  Like I said, you got lucky.I know you didn't just say "tell a cop." ... That is literally the worst idea I ever heard. Please do NOT I repeat DO NOT go to the authorities and tell them about your friend who is using opiates. It's already done, I'm not going to delete it because that's how I feel about it. If the mods feel that what I said was bullying or hate speech I have faith they will remove it. I don't think it is though. I honestly think that if this didn't happen OP would have gone the rest of his life without speaking with his friend again and not thought twice about it. Then once the guy passed he suddenly cared enough to post this romanticized version of him writing someone off. 

I've heard the phrase "some people only love you after you're gone",   and I think that holds true here. Maybe I'm just jaded.No no,The dudes name is opaitesparody or some shit like that I guess he starting to parody some posts that are found on this sub and was just having fun. At least I didn't sense that he was upset or pissed in any way with you, he was just fucking around. While that's true, and I upvoted you, we can make a difference. 

People don't change unless they want to change, but we can help change their perspective. I know I've personally made a huge difference in dozens of people's lives simply by showing them a different point of view. 

I've also tried to help many people, until it became obvious they didn't necessarily want my help. Then I have to let go. It's difficult to determine which is which oftentimes. 

Opiates are a special danger. It's not actually clear what the friend was hooked on, but drugs like heroin and its like, or on the other side, crack cocaine or crystal meth, are demons I don't wish on anyone, or anyone's loved ones. 

But yeah. In the end I can't want someone to change more than they want to change. That's a losing proposition. Im starting to think you aren't really smart there guy. I wrote this one day at work while grieving, having no idea it would get as much attention as it did. i had no one to speak about it with, so i essentially wrote a memoir for myself, as a way to acknowledge my guilt, and express the way i felt the only way I knew how. If you think going into length about how shitty of a person I was to one of the best people I ever knew made me feel better, you're a fucking idiot. if anything, i wanted to tell a story that could potentially help anyone reading from making the same mistakes I did, and judging by the comments, I did just that. And yeah, that does make me feel better. Fuck off dudeSeriously, that's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking heard as far as helping an addict. Cops are not there to assist recovery, they will destroy the friends life. i hope the mods leave your response because to be honest it was the only one i really expected, there just happens to be a lot more understanding people on this forum then i ever would have imagined. i dont blame you for your views, they are accurate as shitty as i feel to say that. i would probably have the same reaction as you, i just wouldnt have taken the time to have written it outGood on you for sticking to your guns. Because you're right. Though I don't blame OP, and this doesn't mean he's a bad person. People hold grudges, people pass judgment, people grow apart. He's human. Respect to him for owning up and putting it all out there.

But that doesn't change the fact that you're right. Your words were harsh but true.  They want to hear the truth but not really.  They only want happy truths. Speaking the harsh truth is something people dont want to hear, because it makes them uncomfortable and its not PC.   
  
There is an overused cliche word that has lost its meaning over the last few years, but it is exactly the word for OP.  
  
**FAIL**.  OP literally failed ~~his best  friend~~ someone he was once friends with.
  
My condolences to the deceased, his family and those that were there for him.  
 
EDIT: Gilded for saying what people are afraid to say/hear.I get that you're grieving.  Just calling a spade a spade.  Hopefully someone does learn how not to be a friend like you. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 50 days clean, not homeless and got my dog back!, Content: , ups: 985, downs: 0I love the one in the back taking a very majestic leakStopping by from r/stopdrinking to say congrats!what state is this in? it looks really pretty.

Being reunited with your best friends.  Jack and Coke?You spelled dog wrongFeel you.  I remember.   I'm hittin 9 yrs next month if all keeps goin good. All it takes is one step in the right direction ,followed by another ,and one more , another one after that.   Start  please.   Love youGotta be a doppelganger unless you've spent some time in the upper midwest, went by KK occasionally and often traveled w/ a pooch named Remi.Are you just jealous or something?? Good on the Op for stopping by and letting some old friends know that she made it through. Prob the biggest accomplishment of her life. Regardless of where she posted this why would anyone ever hate on someone kicking addiction in the ass. OP, I'm super happy for you. This is not directed at
The OP and just a general statement but I find it attractive that a girl has the will power to get clean and also the open mindness to try opiates in the first place.
I've found this sub to be way more active than recovery and many people here even if using are supportive Good man, still clean and loving life. How about you? Im not jealous or anything like that, but I'm sorry dude watch this is post number 2 like this. In the next week or two we are about to be flooded by posts like this. I just dont think it belongs here, it's nothing personal against OP, honestly I'm proud of everyone who quits but still it's really not the place. 

I guess I'm the minority when it comes to having this opinion and if that's the case, it's the last time youll hear me bitch and moan about it lol.

No hard feelings dude?

Have a happy new year man!Totally I agree, I was wrong to say what I said in my original comment. I may not agree but I respect everyones decision, who am I to say what belongs here? I was wrong, should have kept my mouth shut if I had nothing nice to say.

Have a happy new year dude!Yea I guess my post had more venom than I meant it to. I see where you're coming from. Have a happy New Years man. I applaud you for replying to me in a mature manner, goes a long way in life. It takes a lot to admit you were wrong. Kudos to you!We are all family here as far as I'm concerned. Family, from time to time, will disagree/fight/argue about silly things. After reading your first comment dude, I kind of agree. If the majority of the community has no problem with these posts and likes seeing them then who am I to say it doesn't belong here. I have respect for everyone here and honestly there really is no harm in active or once active community members posting about their achievements whatever they may be. We support each other... I was wrong to say it doesn't belong here, because this isn't some bullshit dictatorship lol, plus we are all equal. My bad for my original comment, again didn't mean any disrespect and of course I'm happy to see one of us make it out of this shit.

Anywayyyyy, you doing anything special tonight????PS: Most of the time on reddit you need a little venom in your posts because most subs arent like this one. Lmfaooooo we where and still are an actual loving community compared to subs like wholesome memes. We are the OGs of that shit lol. Mad love for everyone here, across the board, you guys have lifted me up and helped got me through the hardest and most challenging times of my life. That is why I respect everyones downvotes on my original comment, that's everyone telling me, "yo dude chill, you are wrong here, take a step back and reevaluate your stance/opinon" On any other sub I would have gotten 10 pms and 10 replies telling me how Im such a piece of shit and all that, instead there's still love, doesn't matter about my differing opinion, you still talked to me pretty much as respectful as possible and I appreciate that man. I fucking love this place and everyone in it, hell I owe my life because of the way everyone here is. Haha this is pretty much the only hood where it's actually all good. And that's why i posted here. All this love. Its amazing. Plus i didnt know of the other sub. When i was thinking of being clean i looked on here for help and tips. I was hoping someone else who might be struggling could see this and get some hope from it.  @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Meanwhile outside of Purdue Pharma’s headquarters this morning..., Content: , ups: 960, downs: 0This is fucking, beyond brilliant.“People say [OxyContin snd Percocet] aren’t a big deal, but then you’re hooked and you run out of money and you turn to heroin.”

I can almost guarantee most people who switched to heroin wouldn't have done so if pills didn't blow up in price when they cracked down on them. At least when we were all doing them, we knew exactly wtf we were getting.

I'm not saying these pharma companies aren't evil, quite the opposite actually. They pushed oxycodone hard on the streets by making it so easy for doctors to prescribe it which got people hooked.  I wouldn't be surprised if the pharmacutical industry did all this because they knew that they had buprenorphine in their back pockets. That way they could keep making money off of addiction when their addicts decide it's time to get clean. 

This is all an obvious side effect of the good ol drug war. I wonder how quick they got a Whif of it before it was too late for it not to be a spectacle.Purdue is my bae. You like dilaudid original formula? Thank purdue.
You enjoy oxycontin? Big ups to purdue. 
Ever take senokot to relieve your stopped up ass from the OIC?
Gracias papi purdueFinally! One I won't accidentally knock over!This is fucking fantastic. Hopefully it gets some good coverage I'm the media.Ok but nobody is going to mention the giant amount of heroin in this spoon just lying there???Meanwhile people that have no other outlet for pain management need prescription opioids.omg I'm an idiot and I thought of Perdue chicken! I was trying to figure out the connection between chicken and drugs.Oh wow lol.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story,amp.html

He was arrested. Placing the sculpture was a misdemeanor charge, and refusal to remove it was a felony. I feel like placing the sculpture didn’t actually break any laws as evinced from the fact they didn’t actually say what the charge was, only that it was a misdemeanor. Purdue pharm hiring the local pigpen (police department) as their goons/muscle.

I could understand failure to comply and remove could be a felony. And that was probably their plan all along because the misdemeanor charge is fucking bullshit.Art imitates life!!Godzilla called, wants a front on a palette of dope.Made by Mr D. EspositoLMAO- now that is funnyBeautiful.This guy is beyond awesome. And he stood up for what he believes by that link. Hes A+ in my book.D.espositoHells yeahCan we get two 'hip hip hoorays'  for the artist!

I've never seen a more perfect piece of guerilla art. And his willingness to take a felony for the cause is awe inspiring.Thanks for posting this

(I also wonder if I could get a good cotton shot off that)Thank you Hooooly shit this is good. We need to go put one in front of every single Sackler property in the fucking world next. I don't think demonizing Purdue is very fair.This shit is great. Solid act of civil disobedience.Seems to me like he was simply trying to enjoy "freedom of expression", per Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Purdue would have done well to graciously thank him for his gift of art. Or perhaps they feel people who use their drugs would never end up using a spoon, yeah, that's it, couldn't happen.GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS! you cna shoot a whole bottle of 80s at once with that thingOhhh I get it now!
Thought it was another tide ad...We boof you faggg ass spoon...dope I. A syringe in my ass ....don't date about nothing Hate the company, loved their products.Upon first glance I thought for sure this was photoshopped. So very glad it's not. This really says a lot with no words necessary!Fuck yes!!!the corporations aren’t the problem imho... 
I’m capitalism every corporation has to maximize profits and keep up an endless growth... If someone won’t play after this rules their competitor will push them out of business. 
The problem is the whole system and/or the lack of regulations. Neat, this in Stamford, CT where I grew up.Legendary...I woulda anchored the damn thing to the ground, tooDude this is so incredible. I wish he woulda bolted it to the concrete so they woulda had a harder time removing it. Either way it’s possibly the best installation I’ve ever seen in my life.Kinda dumb. Unless his brother was one of the 1st patients prescribed the use of Oxycontin he would have known it's potential to be addicting. Thats on the user to keep using. None of us would blame a dealer for using and having an addiction because its on us. You can stop if you REALLY wanted. Would y'all be cool if he did this out side your dealers house?Because they forced everyone to take pillsas chronic pain suffering person, i cant justify blaming the people who make the drug, its the fucking law makers that are at fault (at this point) for restricting access to medications, purdue certainly plays a part, but i am extremely greatful for them making the drugs they do that allow me and millions of others to live, 

this is coming from someone who has committed suicide by heroin and lived after a 30 day coma... because my medication where abruptly stopped after a decade, people, especially my generation (im 30) really need to fucking take personal responsibility for what they do, the drug company didnt force you to snort that pill or shoot it, or eat it, they simply made it available for people with pain  those who fell in abuse/addiction because of the ease of access or however it came to be, thats a tragedy, but personal responsibility is above just blaming the people who make the shit... Roflrofl you soyboys are so pathetic. Youre whats wrong with america ironically.Thanks to all the people who cant take medication resposibly you have royally fucked all the chronic pain suffers. You chose to fuck yourselves up and have drug everyone down with you. This is F’ing epic, I wish I could of seen the faces of all the big wigs... Yes, totally brilliant! Especially since the Sackler family (of Purdue Pharma) are huge supporters of the arts. The north wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is named, “The Sackler Wing,” and there is also the Sackler Gallery, in Washington; the Sackler Museum, at Harvard; the Sackler Center for Arts Education, at the Guggenheim; the Sackler Wing at the Louvre; etc. 

It would be awesome is one of these could be dropped outside each of the institutions bearing their name. 

I already shared this link below, but their support of the arts makes this even more fantastic. 
[Empire of Pain]
(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) Wait though, what is he trying to say?  I feel like everyone is upvoting this because it’s cool to see a giant heroin spoon, but is he actually on our side?  I’m not sure I understand his message, so if someone would ELI5 I’d appreciate it. Old news. Buprenorphone isnt new. Been around a longggg time. So yeah, they set up the timeline so they could market it accordingly and make their dosh. No big secret.The point about buprenorphine is well taken especially if Purdue and reckitt benckiser have some back deal connectionBuprenorphine is still fully under patent ... and thanks to evergreening with new "improved" formulations will continue to be for quite some time.

Oxycodone (and all other classic narcotics) are at the very very tail end of the whole patent/evergreening process.  Awfully profitable little coincidence if you ask me...

Likewise most of the major players influencing this push against narcotic pain management have *major* stakes in large scale drug treatment programs ... like "Phoenix House".

Ever hear of PROP (physicians for responsible opiate prescribing)?  ...well all of their major stakeholders also own stakes in Phoenix House.

Everyone complains about Purdue's corruption and their role in the opioid crisis ... but the major players "fighting" against the opioids are engaged in *exactly* the same sort of unethical shady business.

The only difference is the shadiness on the part of the anti-opioid crusaders is hurting people with chronic intractable diseases ... while Purdue's actions hurt people using drugs illegally by choice.  In a lot of states there are actually laws on the books meant to ensure Pain patients receive ethical treatment from their doctors that are either being ignored and directly violated ... obv. there was never any expectation an addict would be treated with opiates for their addiction, but we have laws meant to ensure exactly that take place for the patients who need them.

Plus when you factor in the reality that this interventions against doctor and patients have actually had an extremely obvious negative effect on the targeted population ... the actions on the part of the anti-opioid fucks is just not in any way redeemable.  Not a chance did they play they long con of purposely getting addicts hooked. It was simple there was a massive untapped market of people who suffer daily from pain. In the past strong pain pills were not used for chronic conditions only end of life or short term like surgery. They already had the drug OxyContin they just had to aggressive advertise and market to doctors how safe it was and they were able to take over the market. And chronic pain is HUGE. Not just the number of people just your talking about having those people taking multiple pills everyday for life. If you get the market share which you did your ROLLING in money. 

They made there fucking money long ago and any lawsuits they face will never even come close to how much they made. I’m not sure but you can clearly see a police car pulled up in the background. I’m assuming they are somehow related. Minutes; possibly sub 60 secs.
What if i just like heroin.Senna's been used for over a thousand years for constipation. Just like oxycontin they took something that had been around for a while, changed it a bit and made a metric shit ton of money. Oh yeah and fighting in court so nobody could porduce their own version of the OG80 and left us with the OPs and NEOs yeah thanks purdue.  The drugs are produced by other companies than purdue all they do are patent and strangle the market.They are also co-promoting Symproic, which has a mechanism specifically for OIC.

But they aren't marketing it directly to consumers, cuz whoops we caused an opiate epidemic so gotta be carefulSo true lol..This!  I'm also the media and I agree. It definitely made the news, it’s been removed and apparently the gallery owner connected to the piece has been arrested and charged with both a misdemeanor and a felony. 

Here’s the link to the story. 

[link](http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-stamford-opioids-spoon-sculpture-0623-story.html) Either you clearly don't use OC or you've literally never thought about your pills beyond ROA hahahaI hope they drop it down to like a littering charge so he doesnt catch a felony (if not just dropping it completely... Obv. that would be ideal.)

Instead theyll probably charge him with slandering the good name of our corporate overlords and have him executed for high treason. We probably should have just left it there and only claimed credit online... could have been out of the state by the time the police showed up.  Then arrange via phone to "have it removed" in a week or 2.The article OP linked says that the misdemeanor was for blocking their automotive pull-in area. Probably misdemeanor vandalism, could be littering, or one of those really broadly written laws like “disturbing the peace.”

Felony vandalism usually has to have a certain amount of property damage associated (like breaking stuff, or graffiti) and there’s not really any damage here. I wanna meet the dboy that will say nah to Godzilla. What is with people here not thinking Purdue is at fault. They single handled changed how doctors prescribed meds and did TONS of shady shit. They intentionally lied to sell pills and made billions. If my drug dealers can be held responsible then so should they. Only the OGs, unfortunately. Which we can't get here in the states anymore. At least not at a pharmacy. Kinda the opposite of hate the sin, love the sinner. This guy gets addiction. /sThey literally said it wasn’t addictive. They told doctors to prescribe it based on lies. 

It’s the same as big tobacco knowing cigarettes cause cancer and hiding it from the public. ## FDA requesting comment on opioid script crackdown hurting pain patients follow link and comment.

You can post anonymously. The FDA director has acknowledged that the misguided crackdown on legal/legitimate opioid scripts is going to far and hurting chronic pain patients.

[https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-1621)

They are requesting public comments on how this has impacted your or your families life. If you have chronic pain and have lost jobs, become suicidal, or turned to heroin because your prescriptions were taken away for absolutely no good reason other than the DEA and Sessions threatening doctors and pharmacists that are just trying to care for people..YOU NEED TO POST!!

Taking away people's in pains prescription's is inhumane, and it is doing absolutely nothing to stem the flow of heroin/fent into the USA, in fact its promoting it.username checks out..While demand is certainly there, you're right, a big part of the stigma and problem comes from drug diversion. If no one with a script EVER sold their pills for a profit, the problem woulsnt be as bad. There's enough blame to go around for the doctor and prescribed patient. You can't buy what no ones sellingTheir faces were the same as any other day.  You think they actually cared?His message is blaming Purdue and big pharma for over producing and lobbying for oversubscribing, causing the opiate crisis we are in now. Although many of us are addicts on this sub, we don't support addiction, and hope we all can find a way to lead happy healthy lives, whether that be with drugs or not.But it's still under patent and will be for quite some time. Thank Bayer.Well yeah, of course Purdue didn't invent senna, they just marketed and branded senokot. Aleve didn't invent naproxen, etc. Indeed oxycodone was invented in Germany in 1916. It was actually originally thought to be a non-addictive alternative to heroin. But they quickly worked out it wasn't even back then.

All Purdue did was stick a time release on it, get a patent for that, lie about its addictive potential, and cash in on overprescription.We are all the media this blessed dayare you fucking kidding me, a felony for leaving an art piece out in public? Can we at least pretend like we still have a fair justice system and only charge him with the misdemeanors that he would have been charged with had he left this in front of a business less wealthy and influential?Wow really shows you who's in charge. That's sad. Well, I'm from Maryland. If you know Md, then you know we have to drive through Delaware, where a lot of Perdue chicken farms are when we visit the beach. I goto the beach a lot. 

I used to fuck with OC but now I fuck with fent and regular dope. I really only use fent now because it doesn't show up on my drug tests in my drug program as long as I don't use 24 hours before. My dealer swears up and down its undetectable, but I still give it 24 hours and pass each time.It will be bargained down, also Pharma will drop the charges.The article says that the felony was for refusing to remove it. The gallery owner stood and chatted with police while waiting for the summons, but refused to remove it.  This was calculated though. He and the artist had already decided ahead of time but he was going to take the criminal charges.He knew what he was getting himself into, but he’s passionate enough about this that he wanted to send a message.i blame the mental health crisis and the gov't not doing enough to address itI only ever had the change to try one once, it was only half so 40mg shot.  at least i can say i tried the original OCs.  My friend that i taught how to shoot up was the one that split it with me.  Hes dead now from a fent/H od.  

alshtough he was the type of guy that would shoot 10 blues within the span of an hour so i pretty much knew it was gonna happen sooner or latter.Ok smart ass.  I just visit this sub cause I ran out of other things to read on the internet.Good example with Tabacco. It’s not that they made they product it’s that they lied in the interests of money with no care of the damage it may cause. thats the main issue, the misinformation that is spread like wild fire, worse than wild fire, it literally over takes peoples idea of what one thing is or is not, its like if you had an orange and a bullet, and they said "these are two oranges" and people where like "well the guy said its an orange so it must be...."  its a total fuck fest to say the least, but still, today, last 5-10 years, people need to talk responsibility for what they do, they know whats what when it comes to opiates, its been a mainstream thing for along time nowThats a huge part of it I still can't understand... so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades prior to OC's arrival, oxycodone, is somehow going to not be addictive due to them adding a time release coating!? I feel they cared mainly about getting all the perks for prescribing drugs for perdue that they overlooked the facts. Yeah but that also comes down to socio economic problems. I’ve know inter city poor people who sold their script because it was either they have there pain meds or they had a place to sleep and had to make a tough choice. Supply and demand.... and it almost just being normal human behavior. I mean we have been doing opiates for thousands of years... There will always be a demand and someone will supply it or find a way to get/make something hitting the same receptors..Who cares if they cared?

It's still awesome.They really don't care. Do U?Buprenorphine? The brand name patent is expired, there's plenty of generics....tons...History on point. A+Perdue deserves a little props for the new age heroin userThe felony charges won't stick. They can try to charge you with anything remotely similar to a broken law, doesn't mean any of that shit will stick. Probably get some 'illegal dumping' charge. The article explains it a little bit.

>	The spoon was placed in an automotive drop-off spot, making the path unusable. The placement of the sculpture was the misdemeanor charge; refusal to remove it resulted in the felony charge.

>	The interactions between Alvarez and police were cordial. While waiting to issue the summons, the gallerist and the cops chatted amiably about civic matters and the opioid epidemic.

>The sculpture, named “Purdue,” was made by Boston-based artist Domenic Esposito, who was present at the time of the sculpture drop. Esposito was not charged or arrested. He said before the art drop that he and Alvarez decided who would take the criminal charges.

I don’t know, that sounds kind of fair I guess. He knows what he was getting himself into by refusing to move it.  

Unfortunately it doesn’t matter if you’re fighting for a good cause, the downside of an illegal protest is that it’s illegal. They tend to make more headlines than organized legal protests, so in *that* way, they are more effective.  The legal consequences are just the price that you pay.  

The criminal charges actually do show that you are passionate enough about your cause to take a hit to spread awareness.  That definitely sends a message that gives fire to your movement.  All in all, even with the charges, I would imagine that he considers his protest a success.

Haha oh I know Perdue chicken to, its just with OC being about the most famous drug of all time, and Purdue being wildly notorious even amongst non drug users it's funny your mind went there. I meant no disrespect nor was I trying to imply you were an idiot for saying thatThis is the problem with things like this. There’s literally too many things that can be the cause of something. There are dozens of contributors. 

I need to look up the number but mental health is something we massively need to invest in. Every dollar we spend we save something like 3$ on incarceration. We can do so much more. We aren't monkeys in a cage. Feel free to browse this sub and comment all you want. But don't be surprised when you get called out on your "addiction is a choice" bullshit. > so all these doctors, were somehow stupid enough to think that a opioid drug that's been around for decades...

[yes.](https://youtu.be/Er78Dj5hyeI) Right... sorry but if someone put a big azz H spoon outside your HQ the reaction would be priceless.and that’s why suboxone exists Wait, so what's his point exactly though? Do people really think the opioid epidemic is the fault of pharmaceutical companies? 

I can understand how non-users might think that, but for people familiar with addiction it just seems... naive.hahha my mind is just on the beach and I have to go by perdue farms when I go there. I wasn't trying to imply you were being disrespectful haha. But I am an idiot either way lolThis 'opioid epidemic' a good portion (maybe majority?) of these people are self-medicating with opiates for an untreated psych. issue because our mental healthcare system has failed themJust stop. So everytime you get high its been against your will? Developing an.addiction isn't a choice butnusing the drugs that lead to that addiction is a choice. Saying its.not takes all the responsibility off the addict and encourages them to.pmay the victim. People will never get clean with that mindset. Ive been there. I shot up heroin for 5 years. I get it. I.made a choice to stick that needle in my arm. I also made a choice to stop.Absolutely.  Oh to have been able to see *anyone's* reaction to it would have been so, damn amazing.

Someone say spoon?overprescribing opiates, which big pharma lobbied for A LOT, is the main reason for the opioid epidemic. Most heroin addicts today started on pills. The companies purposefully did little to nothing to detect fraud and misuse of their product. They marketed and produced them in ways that caused more addiction potential. They only started making them non-injectable in response to pressure from society. Its fucked up.I believe that my addiction is my own fault. However Purdue is very much at fault for allowing the supply of pills. Just like I don’t blame heroin addiction on the cartel I choose to pick up that bag but they should still be held responsible for their end. 

Mainly what Purdue did wrong was aggressively advertise to doctors that they had an extremely safe low addiction potential product. Which the data they used to support this was fabricated. There aggressive advertising didn’t just push their product but they supplied entire literature  for classes centered around managing pain. They changed they way in which doctors thought to treat pain which heavily relied on opiates. And whether or not you believe this is a good medical  decision know that they didn’t do this for pain patients but rather to sell more product. 

What they did was sketchy and bad in so many areas. Ultimately the addict needs to be responsible for their choices but so do the suppliers for actively making money while  deceiving doctors and the public 
This is an excellent piece that paints a clear picture of Purdue Pharma and the “Opioid Crisis” they created, through means of subversion, lobbying, targeting poor communities and paying doctors to lie-in order to get Oxycontin into the hands of millions of trusting patients, desperate for relief from chronic pain. 

Fm the Article in the New Yorker, ‘Empire of Pain:’
“According to training materials, Purdue instructed sales representatives to assure doctors—repeatedly and without evidence—that “fewer than one per cent” of patients who took OxyContin became addicted.”

*sorry for format-on shit mobilePriceless to see those greedy CEO big wigs no doubtI’d much rather regulated companies flat out sell opioids to addicts then forcing them on the black market to buy unknown..[This article](http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/) is really good too.

Oh and [this one](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/) about Purdue's current expansion into developing markets like China: "we're only just getting started."

Funny thing, even though the UK is not exactly a developing market it's also not really been a target market for Purdue since the NHS is much stricter about scripting opiates than the US healthcare system, but recently Shorttec and Longtec scripts have suddenly gone up and they've become available on the black market too. Those are brand names for oxycodone. The company that makes them is called Qdem. The parent company of Qdem is Mundipharma. The parent company of Mundipharma is Purdue. Agreed. But they can’t lie to everyone saying the opiates cause addiction in less than 1% of cases. Then when it is proven they lied they should pay 

But agreed the way things were in the pill mill days were much safer than they are now Yeah that is the real ethical problem imo. I think many of us can agree the war on drugs is a failure. Regulated markets are better than black markets.

However, selling drugs to druggies who know what they're getting into is different from lying to patients about how dangerous a medicine is.

People trust doctors, and corruption by Purdue lead to this trust being abused. A lot of people got hooked on opiates because doctors acted like pushers and those people would not have gone anywhere near smack otherwise. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: 😂, Content: , ups: 921, downs: 0Hahaha good one. My old ass hates itit wasn’t the 90’s, but when i was a senior in high school in 2008, i was doing oxy 80’s (the old, better ones that u could just break up so easily) and even sometimes i could get the old 160 mgs. anyways, that and opana and everything else. then one day my friend got some fent patches and was like just suck on this patch. i was like “that sounds retarded, sucking on a piece of paper to get well”. now look at me 10 years later, literally putting pieces of suboxone paper under my tongue everyday. lol.YIKES!I literally love this post. It finally makes me feel understood, and included. I’m a young, newer opiate user who started with fentanyl less than a year ago, and it ruined classic opiates for me. I never got to enjoy oxys or heroin.Golden �Haha funny and trueThis is a good oneBahahaha ���..                   nm.Fentanyl is a damn good painkiller. I would love to be put on a patch.i love this memeYeah I miss that era of my use too. Around 2007-2011. Back when I could semi afford a pill habit of OC, dilaudid and oxynorphones. For some reason too no one ever knew how cheap they were selling the dilaudids and opanas and would get them cheap as fuck like .10-.25 bucks a mg. Even OC was very max .50 a mg and that was like full retail price.That fuckin sucks homie !This is what pisses me off when people want to show off their drug dick and brag how they went straight to snorting heroin or IVing right off the bat in their opiate consuming career.

&#x200B;

Its DUMB, noobs should start with codeine or tramadol because if you go straight to the hardest shit your tolerance is ruined, you miss out on that honeymoon period where you can use cheaper easier to find shit occasionally.

&#x200B;

Its like joining some public bisexual orgy for your first sexual experience, its dumb! Enjoy the small things first.I feel bad for you.i think i used to pay like $10 for an 80mg when i’d buy them in bulk back then. but then it went up to $15, then $20, then finally $25. by then i had moved on to H and then methadone. I had to go to a methadone clinic basically every day. that shit sucked after a while. It’s nice how easy it is to get suboxone prescribed where i live now, especially if u really need it. but honestly, i totally miss how cheap and simple things were back in those days.Yeah, it really does suck for people who can’t enjoy it the way I do. I have such a romantic love for fentadope bags ��Um, somebody offered me what they had. What, was I supposed to tell them to go fetch me oxys? Shits are expensive, I’m not about to be picky about free drugsI agree. I started on codeine and got a good high on 15mg. I spent a year climbing the codeine ladder until it did jack. Then I went onto oxycodone. Nearly 3 years later, 10mg is still a decent dose that’ll help pain. I’d probably need 20mg to get high.I don’t. Oxys are so fucking expensive.Nah bro it sucks that you started up using in the era of Fentalogues... Fentanyl doesn’t hold a candle to Oxymorphone, at least not for me... with fent it always felt like a short lived body load with not near as much euphoria. To each their own I guessYou got high on 15mg of codeine?My first opiate experience was IVing hydromorphone, I think it was something like 3-4 mg. Needless to say it blew away so hard. That first rush experience with the best rush opiate of any is amazing. But now I don’t really enjoy anything else except maybe some decent H if I can get my hands on some ( very rarely). 

Here in Eastern Canada the most common opiate and by far the most available is hydromorphone, it’s hard to find anything else.

I agree with what you said however. I wish I had started with Oxys or something and worked my way up like a normal junkie ruining her life. 

It’s hard to pass the needle once you know how it feels and how easy it is to prepareDidn’t used to be. I was getting a 100 pack of blueberries in 2008 for 320$. OC80s you could get 50 for 300 and this was even cold copping prices in the major north western city. 

When I heard roxi 30s were fucking 30-45$ street price now I couldn’t believe who would pay that when you could get a gram of good heroin for that price, that was 2012ish. Oxymorphone and gel fent patches kinda fucked up the game and then the crack down, and reload of really good cheap dope. 

Now Good luck getting dope without a RC in it, and it’s like 80/g. I was getting fingers of Fire ECP for 260 as recently as 2017 

Been off opiates since 2017 so i could potentially be unaware of somethingI agree with you wholeheartedlyI no joke dreamed about oxymorphone last night. Christ I miss itI loved popping ten oxycodone and being lit for a day.Yeah, but it’s not like I know what I’m missing. It’s just a generation gap. I’d love to try dillies and pandas, but they’re so expensive in comparison. And short legs is advantageous. I’ve survived so many overdoses, and I can get high anytime, because I’m sober within the hour.Initially, yes. It was more like a buzz.I pay $140 for a bundle of “heroin” which is just bags of fentadope that I love. I’ll mAre you yeezusWow, livin the dreamAh right, you must metabolize it really well. I'm at the stage where i'm taking 500mg or so daily, and it doesn't do shit anymore. Gonna have to get on the dark net and find something better i suppose.Yeah, just like the rest of you opiate addicts on here.Definitely the dream lmao�[removed]Get off your high horse m8

Edit: Relevant UsernameThanks for the advice dude, i'd take every precaution if I started getting stuff on the dw, the risk is what keeps me away.We don't allow specific markets or vendors to be named here.What high horse? I’m not allowed to enjoy my own god damn drug of choice without having everybody talk shit about it, saying “oh that sucks for you”It is so funny that a subreddit of fucking heroin addicts can't let someone do whatever the fuck they want.  Actually hilarious how delusional they are, you do you bro.  Be safe. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Revenge Hack, Content: , ups: 908, downs: 0No no no, destroy your life with drugs, feign getting clean, get your ex-back, relapse and ruin both of your life's..... Bonus points if you can trick your ex to get on dope after the relapse.Damn, this made me sad. Y’all hang in there. You can beat the pain. Seems impossible, but I promise it is not. Hahahaha �That's what I did to Church Girl. [deleted]Dam this hits home :’(Damn this turned out to be way more controversial than it should have been. Genius Fuck! I relate to this to much!It’s unfortunately meDam this hits close, my drug use got pretty fucking bad when my ex broke up with me I can’t imagine what a divorce would do to meHAHAHA REKTTTTI am one step ahead of youThis happened to me lolToo relatable lolYes because people who take drugs are really beneath contempt, let's keep that trope going. Can we have a bit more racism and sexism in here as well, please?noIt was just a joke dudeWhile I agree, pretty sure all of us know this already. Therefore it's a bizarre and funny joke.LolYou’re a beast metroFeel for you dude been in that same boat at least twice In society, they absolutely are. Whether you like that or not, that’s the truth. So I’m not sure why your point is here. No. No it’s not. The joke is, it’s not a joke ...The point being that we ought to make the attempt to understand why people take drugs instead of persecuting them. That's difficult and expensive and it's the same reason why mental health provision in general is so poor. Great advances have been made in the field of physical health but mental health lags significantly. It remains a taboo subject amongst suffers, nobody is declaring that they have mental health issues, you would be unemployable at the very least.You don't seem to understand what the phrase "beneath contempt" means. You just agreed that addicts are beneath contempt. You are trying to express that society *sees* addicts as *worthy of contempt.* Yeah, it is. It’s about revenge. They’re using it as way to get back at the person who dumped them. The joke being that it’s a very extreme length to go to just to get revenge on that person. Ummm, do you get it?Funny... I still laughedPerhaps the best way to bring attention to the subject is with comedyR/wooooshI think you're just shitfaced, sir. Do you get it dude? Lol That is usually a very effective tool.Perhaps a meme even??I kinda feel like the exact same thing should be said to you lolI was being sarcastic though lolShould have added an /s cause nothing about the way your comment comes off sounds in any way sarcastic at all...You are getting downvoted lol, it was a sarcastic comment on how yes it’s staged as a joke but it has real life altercations to people a lot of the time. Lmao lol I’m getting downvoted - by you - 2 downvotes. Oh no, better close my account!
See, THATS sarcasm � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I did a thing!, Content: , ups: 901, downs: 0I used to be an active member of the opiates community. I was on opiates for 10 years, IV heroin at the end of it. From a low bottom hopeless homeless rotten scumbag like me, it truly does get better. Shoutout dejaGood work man. I'm day 29 and spazzing tf out. Cant quit thinking about dope.Congratulations!  You're one strong willed person.  I wish you the best in your future endeavors!  Fucking love me some Brand New. �������������Congratulations!!! That is great news to see someone succeed. Awesome.I'm only at 5 months man haha, congrats. Takes some real will power.Amazing! How'd you do it!? 

&#x200B;Congrats fam. 8 months hereIs that image from déjá entendu?Coming from someone who is mostly a lurker around here and a momma of an addict who lost his battle in June...... I have tears in my eyes when I tell you how happy and excitedI am for you!!!  I wish for you a beautiful life. Congratulations I'm nearly 10 months, and you're my inspiration. Your phone background helps.1000 days and approx $40k in savings... you did remember to put all your would-be dope money in a savings account, didnt you? 




I know I sure didnt. Congrats dood. Congratulations! I’m very happy for you. Wow that’s amazing, I wish I had your strength. You just gave me the inspiration to resist my craving for the night. HOLY MOLY MACKEREL CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!Brand New?Iv been on opiates for 13 years now mainly methadone, im so tied of this feeling i just want my life back. Im reducing so hopefully next year will be the year i get off it fingers crossed.Love your wallpaper. Congrats! Congratulations!Contrary to my username, Daisy is actually one of my favorite albums of all timeWord my favorite bandUhm, what’s that app you’re using? And looks cool, only thing that Bothers me is how the white font on the bottom kind of blends in with the background a bit. Congratulations! ��This is a big step to reach.  Hopefully you can convince others to 
join you.
Great work dude! Proud of you for this feat!Congrats. Legit having that deja entendu art tattooed on my leg in two weeks Dolor hic proderit olim. <3What app is this Congratu-fucking-lations
It's always good to see people who have pulled out of this. Gives me inspiration I might as well someday.You got out just as fent was about to get really bad. That decision might have saved your life!Congrats. Going on 9 months here. You are truly an inspiration!Your one of the best in my book! I'd rather hire a guy like you who has been through hell and comeback alive then 100 other guys that have had an easy go. God Bless you man. Congrats...I used to work with a guy who was a ex-heroin addict. Now he runs a multi-million dollar company and brings in north of 500k /year home.Oh man. 2 years since I touched fentanyl. Overdoses... Dying from withdrawal seizures and dehydration.

I still feel like ass,but I feel way better. Went to rehab and everything. I couldn't do anything I wanted to die, but I got put in some psychiatric hospital because I told the doctor that. 

2 years later I'm better. All started with taking my grandma's vicodin (she didn't use them or wanted to, she threw them and I took it) don't know why she'd buy them anyways. You can deny a script. 

Then to Norco, oxy, tar heroin... Fent (first hit, OD) and continued fent for months despite almost dying. 


And these DEA. FDA people wanna get rid of Kratom but not shit like vicodin that dentist tried to give me but I refused and felt good about it.

Kratom basically is like a weak opiate feel but it's different. It's energetic for me. When I stop, I can still function. I just get stomach issues.

Not saying to try kratom either in just mad cause I've been informed about the lies FDA and shit are spreading.

Well, congrats to staying clean.Blessings to you! ��Thank you brother. May life bless youI was lucky enough to see them do the devil and god all the way through in 2016 before the shit hit the fan. Deja still has a big place in my little grinch heart though. It started getting better for me around 60 days. Once I got over that hump everything started making sense. Up until then, though, it was nearly constant. I was lucky, I got to go to long term treatment. AmenDon’t say “only” - give yourself some credit! I’m sure it took work to get there. Slowlyyyyyyyy. No but for real I went to a 90 day treatment program, a halfway house, and lived at a sober living house for 15 months before I let myself experience the real world. I’m an active member of AA and have a home group, sponsor, and good friends who support me. It is I’m very sorry to hear about your son. It’s not the same but I lost my best friend in July and can’t imagine what it would be like to lose a child. Occasionally a using thought will pop into my head and the first person I think of is my mom. Again, I’m so so sorry for your loss. Back when I was active I used to kind of idolize you; it’s an honor to be on the other side. If I had saved it all I’d have over a hundred grand according to the app. Unfortunately I don’t have that much but I have a positive balance in my account and a paycheck that keeps coming every two weeks with no threat of being taken away anytime soon!Yes sir or ma’am It’s called Sober Time. I picked the background photo so you could always choose something that fits better with the whiteSober Time, you can choose your own background photo Oh believe me, it did. I overdosed on fentanyl three times in one week before I stopped. Girl, but thank you all the same! I work in the treatment field now and it’s really cool getting to help people like me. Goddamn, think about how much heroin he could buy.I’m a girl! But thank you all the same. Saw that same tour with modern baseball and tfb  that show was epic came to see if anyone recognized the background, and quickly my heart sank after reading this comment because i’d sell my kidney to see the devil & god are raging inside me live. fuck id kill to see them live at all but now i sadly probably never will � (still clinging to hope they’ll someday soon at least do a reunion tour)I also saw their anniversary tour in 2016 where they played the whole record! At the time I was disappointed there was no new record for the show, but TDAG is my all time favorite album and seeing it front to back live was basically a religious experience for me.

And I got to see them play science fiction the next year anyways :)Thanks, I appreciate the kind words.Glad to hear it bro-  thats a solid gameplan and I'm a big advocate of sober living/halfway. Well thank you.  As my heart heals I intend to find ways to honor him and get his story out there.  It can be so discouraging but then there are stories like yours that remind me that there can be freedom and there are happy endings.  Keep killing it.  You are awesome Who is he that you idolized him? I recognize the user name but is there something I’m missing, like is he internet famous or something? Lol This is inspiring and priceless, really. Congratulations to you and keep up the positive attitude and hard work ~ you're doing so well!I have that astronaut tattooed all over my arm!Love your choice! It’s Daisy and Deja, right?!how do you help?Lol.... I think.Is it bad that was my first thought, probobly but whatever.That’s the one! I went to the show in CT. I feel the saaaameYou just learn who certain people kind of are when they have a recognizable username and post here often. Sometimes to the point of feeling like you know someone.I do intakes and admissions and I’m a counselor internIt's your cake day, you're allowed to think bad thonks on cake day.Haha same me tooI was going to respond but you got it. Exactly this. how did you get into it?YES!Nice. That venue was really cool. A couple of my friends from my old home group have various jobs at the rehab I work at, and once I had 2 years and a spot opened up they let me know and I went for it!Yeah the oak dale is pretty nice. Congrats on getting clean man, big ups to you When I was in an in-house detox for heroin, the people who helped the most were the counselors who had been addicts. They didn't miss a thing and I still remember their advice. They were a million times more spot on than the psychiatrist who you hardly ever saw anyway.

Well done and good for you helping others. No one is more qualified. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Yuh, Content: , ups: 890, downs: 0One time this dude asked me to swing by to drop off, but his family was visiting his house. Ok no prob, I said, I'll just leave it on top of the tire of your car or in your bushes. I pull up a there's an old man literally right outside staring at the street?? I park in front of the next house on the street, the old man is his dad who went outside to make a phonecall. I'm thinking okay lmao now what, so I get out of the car and shove the shit up the neighbor's rain pipe on the side of their house, get in my car and look up and see the neighbor in their fucking living room staring out the windows, behind the blinds, at me. I tell the guy where I left it and gtfo lmao"So this is the friend we've heard so much about... Like a plate? The wings are hot off the grill!

You want what, exactly? All flats? 

*slowly begins scratching head*

Flats... coming right up... Excuse me moment, if you would."

*walks inside, unlocks phone*

"Ok Google, what part of the chicken is flat?"






Sooo like all Dominicans & puerto ricans in the boston area? haha

Shit bro.. I’m puerto rican and i think its hilarious. dumb assess stick out like sore thumbs Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent 'ya! Damn spitting imagine of one of my dudes lmao. And he would do that too hahahaha.Ill always upvote dipsetOr when u pull up to meet ur plug and he has a custom bright ass burn-ur-retina paint job w/26" sprewell's... "I'm sure no one knows what just went down bro.... We r good".. lolThe whole byrd gangs in here AYI would rock this get up.Holy fuck I copped a few grams at a quinceanera one time. Was the only white dude, was hilarious. its funny cuz i pretty sure julez just got in trouble for gun and 8 blue berrys in his bag when he was trying to catch a flight. 
Its all fun and games until your uncle walks up to the plug and they know each other lol So pathetic, needing to buy your next high while at a family cookout. Free max b[deleted][deleted]What’s flat?Wait wait, who fucking grills flats and drumsticks? If youre grilling wings they better be whole from rib to tip and slathered in chiavettas, if theyre broken down you should be frying them like mama bellisimo intendedMy Lawrence dboys �Shit I wish Juelz was my dealer. Thats correct, saw it on NORE's show.Never understood drug dealers like that. Either don't respond or give an accurate time frame wtf is the point of lying or being annoying if it's someone trying to give you their moneyOh no cuz if it’s bunk you’re just trying to get free shit! Lol I had one dealer I guess who would always talk shit behind my back. Look I know a lot of people let you short them and fuck them over but I have never been that chick. I’ll say something every fucking time til I’m going somewhere else. 

It’s extra awesome when they think you need them. And when you haven’t seen them all weekend they’re calling you asking if “you alright.” Psht too late bitch!So true!!The flat part of the wing...not the drumstick aka the best part!Chiavettas! I see you're from the East coast.Caspar MilquetoastI got into a heated fight with a woman who was middling for me over this. She would always tell me she had what I needed, but after 6 hours of dicking me around it would become clear that she never had it, and she was just trying to string me along until she had it. She was desperate for her cut of the dope.

Another kid I bought from for a while straight up told me, "you've gotta make em wait to remind the customers of their place". Fuck that guy.Because if they say they arent ready you will just look somewhere elseQft!!!   I have a guy that delivers and I'll call at 5pm,me- "yo dude, can u roll thru?". Him-"Yup, I'm just going to stop get some gas and Ill that way"
Me-"ok bro thx, I appreciate it". Hr and a half later, I call back, me-" hey man just making sure ur still rolling thru" 
Him-" yup I got u, I'm heading that way now".  He lives about 15/20mins away. It's now 715, I text- "u getting close by?? "Him- yup passing ##### street now omw".  It's now 8:20, I hit him back one more time, he answers sounding aggrevated, "yeah",. Me-"just making sure u are still coming this way?". Him- " I told u I'm omw". Just about perfectly the amount of time it takes for him to get to me from his crib from then he shows up.  I mean fuck I've even tried to b like yo man can u roll thru, I'll grab my regular.. and if u can't get here for a lil it's cool, just lmk... Naw man, I'll b there asap...3-1/2 hrs later, he shows... On the bright side, allot of times he "hooks it up" for making me wait.... So I know he understands the concept of time... Apparently just doesn't grasp the idea of conveying that info my way...I've had about a dozen solid connects, and that theme holds true for every one of them!I know this isn the same but when I was selling nug in college and I remember when I started I would be super punctual and give people accurate time frames because I mean the shit sells itself you just roll through and grab the cash. After a year or so I remember getting super lazy about it and would get annoyed when people would hit me up all the time.  It was mostly annoying when these people I wasn’t friends with hit me up and I had to drop what I was doing. I can imagine selling harder drugs the people annoy you more and the hours are even more fucked. Then I got hooked on dope and I guess karma happened cuz I had such a SHITTY middle until I got introduced to my boy running a trap. [deleted][deleted]It's a way to keep you from going to the backup dope boy. I'l lbe there in 5 keeps you from going somewhere else Seriously...dont they want to make money??I had a dealer who I would weigh his product every time cause his runners were dumbasses who skimmed bags every once in a while and he loved that I told him when it was weak or missing even like .05 on a quarter. He would always replace product missing taking my word for it (since I actually never lied amazingly enough) and if it was fucked up stuff where maybe the runner cut it he would throw me extra too usually "uncut". Best dealer I ever had, got to watch him move up from running around in his beat up subey with his gf to having 3-5 runners making bank so he always treated me well. [deleted][deleted]I didn’t know that was what it was called but the flat is my favorite part. Yeah, baby!Yup, and more meat too. Western NY, i know my wings.I've heard the remind the junkie of their shit place in the world before and was blown away. Like really your gonna play the holier than thou card dealing dope?[deleted]Fine then, look somewhere else if you want to pay more rather than wait, but I know they'll be back eventually. I always try to work in the customers best interest, and if that interest is someone else selling for double my price then so be it lmfao At least he comes through. Today for example we spoke at 11:45 I call at 4:45, twice and get chewed out for “blowing him up while he’s doing family shit”. & then says he’s turning off his phone after me trying to explain that there’s no way I could know that. Um excuse me, then why did u say u were on the way at 11:45.... fucking ridiculous. I HATE every dboy I know it’s pathetic. All depends on his mood.Yeah it's annoying, especially since I work crazy long, weird hours at a real job too, but st the end of the day I remember that money is money, and I need money.Damn. Where do you live that does deliveries? If someone's gonna go low enough to roll on one of their dealers to try and escape the consequences of their own fuck-up, wouldn't they rather roll on one of their less reliable dealers rather than their #1 connect?I'm lowkey enough already that there's no way anyone is gonna roll up my name tbhI don't really care if they end up going to someone else tbh lmao. I already know I've got the cheapest, if you'd rather pay double the price for someone who's just gonna yank your chain for 5 hours like everyone else rather than wait 3 hours for me to get off work and serve you promptly then uhh that's your choice lolThey always do, but sometimes you let your personal feelings of being inconvenienced and annoyed of being taken out of something you're currently doing get in the way. The bigger you are the more likely you are to get those feelings That’s fucking awesome, you the real OG my dude!shit most the h aint even real h these days... its all chemicals and bullshit. Theyd rather mix 10 different analogues together and call it h then just get some real h... seems like a much bigger hassle having to acquire all that shit but I guess they just blinded by profit margins sadly. Sucks cuz all the old heads who actually care about running a good business and keeping custies happy are all leaving the game or dying off leaving all these idiots who only see dollar signs to take their place and the product goes from being 7/10 or better all day to, "lets play who can guess whats in my dope and how strong it is today..." ranging from bunk to OD. Brap brap! Can't say specific locations but I'm living quite near a place famous for wings.It's really troubling how high and mighty a little power over others makes some people.It’s hilarious to me how so many of them act like they are your lifeline. Don’t forget bitch, you’re working for me! You don’t come correct, I’m gone. And then of course if they haven’t seen you all week they’re asking where you are. I hired someone else mofo peace! 

Ugh you know last week I drove my connect who is on house arrest to see his P.O. this mother fucker had the nerve to say to me after driving for 2 hours “I’m on a time limit, you ain’t!” Excuse the fuck out of me? I have a life and that whole not respecting my time but demanding me to respect yours, that don’t fly with me. Haven’t seen his bitch ass since. I really cannot stand those types. Hate to break it to you, but I really don’t need your ass.Damn you sound like such a cool person! I wish you were my connect.This is true, I have 3 on rotation just for those occasions..lol. let's c how long they get irritated for calling them back hrs later when we stop calling em back:).Exactly, i don't know where unRare lives but where i'm at if you're a piece of shit you get flipped, if you're good and give extras though, credit and all that, nobody even dreams of talkingI completely agree with Project.  If the guy is gonna rat I think he gives up the connect that treats him the worstYeah that'd be really fucking stupid for anyone to roll on whoever has the lowest prices. Roll on the one with the highest with the shittiest product lmfao Dude no if u ppl just keep ur mouths SHUT when/if u ever get caught up and either comply with the police or have a sure way to escape, u will all get into less trouble duh cuz u want at least evidence against u as possible.  They can’t just go on ur phone but need to have a passcode on it and I’ve been charged with 4 sales/etc felonies a few years ago and got caught with over 50 gs of h and a bunch of different other shit, 4 phones, 2 scales but I kept my friggin mouth shut and it all got dropped after about a year and a half.  This was in Cali tho and I did have a private attorney Maybe I'm the only one who has had paranoid, rude connects. I agree it's silly, the reason I got sober was because how annoyingly hard it was to score good dope. Routinely waiting hours in my car after getting a location. You got it right though, just find that rare in my part. Poppin' OCs from the Florida pill mills and shooting real dope for 10 years without a taste of fent til just last month when I relapsed. I feel like an old man in a young persons game now. Getting back on track right now with a week clean. I don't think I can survive any longer but I have the motivation to stay clean even if it's just cause I want to be able to tell those youngsters about the good ol' days in the opi game. Same here. Of course all the famous places have crappy wings ;)Just look at Reddit mods anyplace but here lol. Or HOAs. Or mall rent a cops. Anything with the slightest hint of power can go straight to a mofos headTheres more than one popsicle stand in town. See I feel like once I get a little older and don’t have like real responsibilities and shit that I’m probably gonna just completely go Head first. My bf and I will sell our house, buy a tiny house, and travel and get high lol. Who knows, I just feel like if I’m in a good place I will probably fuck it all up.

And shit, you get clean for any damn reason you want! Lol gosh I really couldn’t imagine how much different shit is now compared to them. I know a lot of people get fent but personally where I’m at it’s pretty scarce luckily. Of course the dope is most likely not as good as it was when you were on your run, but I do love me some tar. Whatever you choose to do, I hope life treats you well! Much love!!I feel you and wish sometimes for that but there would still be sick days and my family would hate me and I'd pick up more felonies and I'd hit a hot shot and die. Luckily my real run was all powder cause just in my little relapse my veins have failed me from the tar. Hope whatever path you choose treats you well and maybe some day you'll want to get clean and if not just please be careful and don't die on us. Love right on backI’m lucky enough to be 5 years in and still not on the needle. I’ve been completely functioning, but my boyfriend has been using weekends and in the last couple months he’s really lost control. So I guess it’s time to quit. I’ve never let heroin take anything from me, but just in the last 2 weeks every single bill has been completely behind now. Worries me, that’s for sure! Would hate to have a drug ruin my relationship but I’ve never been the type to lose it all for a substance. Luckily I’ve been able to maintain some sort of control.

And I think you’re doing the right thing. Losing your family I’m sure is horrible, so definitely keep up how you’re going. Good luck fam! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: The real MVP, Content: , ups: 887, downs: 0It is illegal for them to open your mail without a warrant, (UPS and fed ex can open if they have reasonable suspicion, although average employees cant open them, they just send them up the chain). If they happen to break open and there are drugs everywhere or obviously visible, then they will send it to their security department and give it to the police. 

I worked for UPS as a manager at one of the largest hubs in the country and have good friends at the post office. We covered this kind of shit in my management training and the head of security for our hub, (who is a corparate higher up dude), told us that the major mail carriers know that they ship millions upon millions of dollars worth of drugs every year and its not really an issue for them. I mean at the end of the day, thats lots of money for them and its not their responsibility to determine if the packages are legal or not.... They, (and the feds) are way more worried about illegal guns or bombs etc. 

In my years with UPS I personally found illegal drugs once, moved around pharmaceutical drugs almost every day, (unfortunately they watch those packages like hawks) and I have seen and heard about a few larger busts too. And seen a lot of other crazy shit in the mail too. Its pretty crazy what people mail around. Honest question, what happens if the package accidentally gets opened on the way to you? I had totally innocent packages that arrived with the Box sort of torn open, I couldn't imagine what would happen if that would have been an illicit substance...

Can you just claim you didn't know it was going to arrive at your house?  That somebody else sent it to you? Or is that just part of the risk?LOVE this one Wish I was smart enough to figure out how to order them online....but with a prison G.E.D education, I'm pretty sure I'm shit outta luck ever trying to figure it out myself lolDo most people here get stuff from dark net? I've always contemplated it, but just wouldn't be worth the risk to me.
You dumbasses need to stop blowing this shit up. Will you ever get over it? Keep it to yourself. This is the type of shit the DEA displays in powerpoint presentations to their boss when attempting to get funding for dw investigations. You're just fucking yourselves. The less you talk about it, the better off everyone will be.Halleluyerrrr ��Made. My. Day. I get off on sering the mail truck in my neighborhood and think "fuck, he's got an envelope full of fent locked in there and he's going to come to me!? Too kind, sir. Too kindAnd for that, we thank you.It's crushing when he doesn't come though and you know you'll have to wait another 24 long fucking hours���The “sentencing reform act” in 1984 eliminated it for crimes committed after 1987. Part of the get tough on crime bullshit. �������Im over here like MEH.... HAHAHA aintnobodygottimefodat!Trust me they know lol Give us a story mister!  Id love to hear some examples first handYou just deny everything, there's nothing linking you to the package so unless you admit to them what you did they can't do shit.Lol.    They have no clueIf it's packaged appropriately then there should be at least one more visual layer beyond the basic envelope. So, even if it accidentally rips open they shouldn't be able to see anything incriminating.Deny deny denyIt’s part of the risk, go find a vacant house and make sure you have a tracking #There’s some really in-depth guides. All you need is a card, a laptop, and a flash drive. What risk? If you use correctly and safely there is little to no riskIdk copping in the hood is part of the experience for me. It’s an adrenaline rush in and of it itself being somewhere so foreign to me. Like I grew up in a nice upper middle class neighborhood and I had a fucked up fascination with dealing with corner boys, figuring out what spots to go to for what drugs, learning how to navigate the hood without sticking out like an easy target. All in all it humbled me and made me realize people in “the hood” are just people too and everybody’s just trying to make a living.Its not perfectly safe, but as long as you order gram or less, its way safer than the streets. Better quality too.AMENNo, they don't..Alright, biggest one I have ever seen. So I was walking into work one day, and I go through security at the front gate and there is a cop car and a cop van out front. I'm like wtf is happening? 

Well I go to walk to out office for our prework meeting and you have to walk past this caged in area where they take all the contraband/broken or leaking shit to either fix it or hold it. The cops are there with the all the higher up people and security guys fucking around pulling packages out of these paint cans. One of the uniformed cops is there just chillin so I ask what they found, he says they dont know for sure yet but they did a field test on some of it and it was cocaine. So I peek over there and see that they have probably 10 boxes, each with 4 paint cans each and they are pulling just pack after pack out of each one. 

Idk how much it was in total, and it was weird because none of us saw anything about it on the news afterwards. But scuttlebutt says it was some coca, and there was pounds of the shit. 
 
Another time a guy on my shift that was a maintenance guy, (worked on the equipment and such) apparently was pretending to work on the belts near this load from a pharmaceutical distributor and would steal boxes off them to look for pills. Our head of security suspected him, so he literally hid inside a large box near there to catch him in the act. When he did they had the cops search him and his stuff, they found a bunch of oxy and bars, some victorias secret underwear and a dildo all that he admitted to stealing that day. This. Deny everything and in the worst case you gonna need a lawyer but deny everything and say you have no clue who sent that. Lmaoooo fuck yea I've read vacant houses are a bad idea. It's a pretty big red flag when you deliver a package to a location no one lives atThe best way to hide something is to make it as normal as possible.  A person who lives at a house the mailman delivers to regularly is the best.  My mailman stole a package that didn’t have tracking.  He was starting to catch on since I would literally hunt him down for packages; most people don’t care that much lol.  I miss Silk Road 1.0.  The fact of the matter is most people don’t want to make a scene and will just deliver even if they know.I'm looking at the Dark web guide for noobs on here, I'm trying to have it make sense to me. Still extremely new to reddit, only found it after searching for withdrawal cures on google lol. I will persevere, because I live in buttfuck KY and this would seriously come in handy A credit card? Wouldn't there be risk of a vendor just keeping the funds and mailing nothing?You had to “realize” that? Lol.   Well I’m glad u did.Mailmen are drug dogs in disguiseThank you fellow afficionado, i was deeply amused, but probably not as deeply as the maintenance worker's plans for that nightWAIT WHAT HE HID IN THE BOX LOLThe only person who can incarcerate you, is you. Definitely, mailmen know what houses on their route are vacant.Back in the 90s I used the mail all the time, I had a dude that was hooked up w.people south of the border,  he went to ASU. And would send 20#s of killer smoke right through the mail. Lol..I'd just give the people of the house like 100$ or like a QP of smoke..Just bout 4 years ago a guy I knew used the same method,  to a vacant house.He had a guy that lived next door to it,  to watch for the drop , Now, this guy knew the lady that owned it, and she had moved..And I guess she had mentioned renting it out, but didnt say when?
So, since there was no "For rent" sign , they figured the coast was clear..The day the Senders put the package (20#s of killer Dro) in motion. Guys showed up to start doing some renovating to update the house,  lol..Panic was setting in..Obviously this wouldn't look good if the neighbor comes over and grabs a package NOT addressed to him, and yes..it was addressed to the none suspecting neighbor,  an older , not hip, lady that looks nothing like this kinna shit would be going on around her, another reason the decision was made to do this btw..Once the package arrives , the mail LADY actually gets one of the working GUYS to get it since it's so fuckin heavy, lol..The whole thing is going down in front of my dude that's helpless, the package is then actually left outside until the home owner gets there, SO, my buddy gets a call from the watcher and is told he has to get it,  HE CAN'T,  hes held up,  whole other story,  lol..needless to say, the home owner gets it, opens it, and actually calls the cops to turn it in..Neighbors were questioned,  but obviously no one knew,except my dude and his friend..very costly for my dude,  very..You're right,  vacant houses are a no go. Not smart at all to do that. It’s definitely useful if you’re smart and careful with it. Just look at the reviews, rating, and other such factors. Escrow helps a lot as well as it pretty much guarantees arrival for your package. You want a withdrawal cure? Here you go!! It works and I never needed such a high amount as the guy who wrote this.

Edit/Update  -- why downvote me for sharing information that can help people? Smh. This works. I've done it for years and I am happy to talk to anyone about it.  

https://opiated.wordpress.com/2007/03/26/how-to-kick-a-habit-easily-with-zero-discomfort/Yeah you need one to buy crypto currency. BTC and LTC are the most commonly used ones, but I opt for LTC myself because bitcoin is ridiculously easy to track. [deleted]Bigger risks are at customs. Because most drugs on dnm get through international customs in multiple countries before getting to the actual destination, it can get seized by them. Yeah I mean when you’re young and people talk about the hood like it’s this scary place where everyone is a thug and you hear about people getting robbed and killed on the news it’s easy to feel like it’s another world.I seen some weird shit there but that dude takes the cake on the weirdness. I'm sure he threw some dope ass parties tho. 

I found a replica of longclaw (Jon snows sword from GOT) once too. It was sharp and sturdy so I promptly used it to chop a tote box in half before replacing it in the box. I was young and dumb but it felt really cool and amused some of my coworkers greatly. He was gonna have some real fun lmaoYes my dude. There's this area there where the belts all converge that they call the pit and thats where dude was chilling taking the shit off the belts cuz there isnt really anyone there. 

But yea, this security guy put a big ass empty box down there to hide in. Little eyeholes and everything. Dude takes his job super serious obviously. He sprang out and scared the fuck out of dude tooWhat they’ll likely do is put the package back together after cataloging and photographing everything in it and deliver it. Then they’ll watch you and the sender and build a better case and hopefully catch a bigger fish. If you have a habit of using the mail they’ll just intercept every delivery and do the same with them. And when they arrest you they can show a pattern. Good luck trying to deny it then. 

I have a friend who did ten years federal time for doing just this. And there is no parole in the federal system anymore. We had a what i will call STUPID AF mailman that INSISTED my house was vacant. He was new to the area granted but NOPE my house is empty apparently. So figure out your mailmans drug of choice and hook them up for dropping off at the same exact time every day.Am a mailman, can confirm. Holy Christ that is heartbreaking. Not gonna lie, would be tempted to run up on the lady in a balaclava and bounce.I went to asu and it led me to become a heroin addict for those 40$ g thru the Mexicans they didn’t even speak English just “negro, blanca, medio, grande?”

And when they picked up the phone you didn’t know who you were taking to. You just said your cross streets and when you got there just kind of looked around for some Mexican dudes riding together. Nothing out of the ordinary in tempe. They would wave you in the store. You go in they grab a polar pop, throw it in there, you put your money in an empty polar pop and


Switcheroo right when you walk outside you just switch cups. You got your shit no questions asked and they answered all day everyday. Why would he get it in a real persons name that doesn't know anything about it? That's pretty shitty thing to do, it's like the people that live with their parents and get drugs delivered to the house. Thanks for the tips, I appreciate it, although I'm slightly weary of detailed instructions online...wouldn't that be easy for the police to look up as well? And how do I even know it's not written by the Feds to catch idiots like me? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seems like a valid concernThis... Is simply not going to work for a lot of people. Methadone is full agonist opiate just like heroin and works on mu-opioid-receptors primarily, just like heroin--unlike the author said as the reason why the said three methadone dose detox works. You will most likely get right back to being sick as a dog about 24 hours after your third and last methadone dose.Not everyone has access to methadoneCould you explain or possibly tell me where to find a good explanation on how to buy LTC or BTC? I have no idea how any of that works Actually there are so many ways to get bitcoin without credit cards. As of now, I suggest bitcoin because it has the highest value, most recognized, and most stable compare to other crypto/digital currenciesBest to order from a supplier in your own country - no customs. What’s there’s no parole In fed r u sure Lmao, rightI’ve done that plenty of times while I lived with my parents. I just said it was something I bought off eBay for my car and I needed my friends help to install it so they didn’t question me when I put it in my trunk and left Feds very well know what’s going on. They really aren’t after you unless your bringing in ridiculously large amounts constantly. They’re only after the big guys as it’s the most logical way to get big busts. Swatting a dude over let’s say 10 bars is completely ridiculous and that’s why it never really happens. Sigh. I've done this for years. So have my friends. It works. 

I am not a scientist.  I cannot explain how it works.  Actually,  scientists can't explain how a lot of things work -- like benzos, for example.  They don't know HOW they work. They just know THAT they work. 

I don't know HOW this 3 days of methadone thing works.  I just know from years of experience THAT it works.

Detoxes in NYC used to do something similar,  but with a rapd taper. Detoxes and rehabs today do something similar with a rapid taper of subs.

I do the same thing but no taper. You don't get sick 24 hours after your last dose of methadone.  Heck, given methadone's long half-life,  it's still in your system 24  hours after your last dose. That's probably part of the reason this works.

Again, I've done it for years and years as have various friends and roommates.  It works. I have no reason to lie to you. 

You can believe me or not although why you think I or anyone would lie about this I don't know.  If you get the opportunity to try it, definitely do. And when you find out it works, as you will, post about it here.

Edit/Update --  and a downvote. Wtf? Why? Look, I understand this may seem unusual.  It may be new information.  But Ive been polite and I am trying to help people.  So I don't think a downvote is appropriate. I know. But it's still good information to have.  Knowledge is power. If you look up bitcoin atms in your area, there may be one close to you. They charge a little more but all you need is a bitcoin wallet on your phone.  There’s a few sites online you can use to get them. A quick google search will help you pick :)Late reply, but check out paxfulTrue, but most methods require identification, or other such elements You do all your fed timeI just mean, weren't you worried they would bring the mail in and get raided while your weren't there or did you have delivery times set up while you were home? Seems legit, thanks for educating the ignorant lol[deleted]Paxful is a good site to get bitcoin quickly and in ways that are super convenient. Not to hard sell, but that's where I got my first bitcoin with a steam gift card. On the site I use (Paxful), I only need email verificationThank you! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Is this how everyone else got started, Content: , ups: 882, downs: 0For me it was my happiness, stability, and sanity...For me it was my Pokémon cards ��Fidget spinners are a gateway drug.Personally I couldn't find anymore free oxysI definitely started at the bottom of the drug ladder to offset being bored. I can't imagine starting off with HMine was. I got a breathalyzer in my car and couldn’t drink and be able to drive so I started using heroin instead. True story. 28 months clean now thank god It was my ex wife. It was either h or murder. I chose the lesser of two evils. I can't wait to tell my mom that she could have avoided years of disappointment and pain if she had just bought me that damn fidget spinner! relapsed cus of this���For me it was dropping out of college. Usually it's the reverseMine started with a conversation:

Friend: \*nodding off\* "I should introduce you to Harry bro!"  
Me:  "I dunno man, i'm pretty content with Mary atm"

Friend: "Fuck Mary"

&#x200B;

And that's how it started. I need to find a Delorean and go back to that point in my life.Fuck man this is bringing up feelsThis speaks to me This made me lol too hardI started accidently through no fault of my own. There I was walking down the street to go help out at the orphanage and I tripped and fell onto a perfectly positioned loaded rig that stuck perfectly into my vein and my weight falling on it made it inject into my bloodstream. Lol 


Nah really I lost a bet and the loser had to get hooked on heroin. Who was the bet with? Life.


(These are jokes for those of you that cant tell)

I love playing with that shit while I nod Lol is there anyone else when they come across the name Devon automatically think "DEVON GET THE TABLE!" ???Why not? LMAOOOOOO no but thats how i relapse ���For me it was weed, xans, booze, shrooms, in hs then adderall and xans and blues and 80’s, then snorting h, been shooting h 4 years, but now on methadone clinic at 170 mg’s with a script of Wellbutrin and xans- 3 footballs a day, I be feeling right everydayIt was either dope and slowly kill myself or immediate hanging.Nicely said. i apparently have a lot of friends addicted to fidget spinners...they always talk about get spun out all the time...it sounds like its a brutal addiction, it ruins your teeth and they cause vicious paranoia .....I dont think Im ever gonna try a fidget spinnner...how can something so small be ruining out country..this getting spun stuff is crazy.

apparently all those dudes out at 3am are all hooked on fidget spinning..Lol!
Yeah... the ones I was buying were suddenly gone, and the new ones would turn into a gel like substance. Quite inconvenient. 
So, Heroin here I come! What’s that, kind sir? $15? I’ll take two! same except first thing I tried was a few vicodin that were left by my great grandmother when she was living with us. popped 3 and fell in love with the sedation/opiate itch. other than that it was the standard stoner/hippie progression through high school... schwag-mids-shrooms-chronic-lsd and/or mdma.

strangely enough it would be another 4 years before I would try another opiate when splitting an old school 60mg oc with a homie. that's what ended up getting me hooked.i think it’s a common misperception that (most) people start out doing heroin. as if someone just out of the blue offered them heroin and they were like, “yea, that sounds wonderful!” i think that’s why addiction is so stigmatized, because people think it’s that simple, so they‘re like, “well just don’t shoot heroin in the first place.” wow, thanks, franklin, i really didn’t consider that. [deleted]Happy b day my dude metro ❤️�bitches be tripping yo....

lolDamn bro Nods in agreement So you dropped out for heroin or because of heroin?Exit the community. You're kidding right?How the hell do people get continually upped to 170?? I was shooting 3g of dope a day but after 3 weeks of 50 mgs methadone im clearly super stable on it and as much as id like to go way up i dont have any real withdrawal symptoms remaining and i feel like itd be hard to fake still being so uncomfortable for so many more weeks until im at a dose like that lol. I second that. Dope doesn't kill you, people do.psst. pssst. yo playa, yeah you. you tryin to get spun? *opens trench coat revealing dozens of fidget spinners*It’s getting “spun outta control” huh? 

Teehee. I was reading your comment all the while thinking "nice, bro" then realized I was giddy about someone's addiction story. Tf is wrong with me. 

Mine started with Vicodin too. 10years Vic's, 4 years Suboxone, 2 years herion.hey them old vicodins were the shitSame exact thing! Grandma would give me her liquid morphine and vics and percs.Then came the ocs (a month of heroin) and finally the animal that is methadone.Yeah I was very persistent on never doing dope, didn’t even get into pills. I could of counted all the percs or painkillers in general on two hands before I got into heroin. Just doing cocaine, and that progressed to crack when I walked in the bathroom and my buddy was blasting off, and he was a junkie so it was like never be like this guy. Just stayed with the hard for a year and eventually had a bunch of heroin I was sitting on and was coming down and was wondering how well it would ease the landing and really the rest is history, fucking loved it. 

Just Kratom psychs and bud now. Lol franklin was one of my rehab councilors so that put that whole comment with a picture of him at the other end and gave me a good laugh Well some people do... i mean im sure very very few as their first drug but probably lots as their first opiate. It was my first downer for sure[deleted]Lol.. Thx for the laugh. I couldn't figure out how to do it. hahahaEnter the dragonCome onThat's ridiculousI ain't trying to get spun, motherfucker! I use them *medicinally*! Now, uh...lemme hold one till Thursday...
I’m laughing so hard right now. 
(Reaching out the window and throws an empty pack of cigarettes down to the person on the street with three spinners inside)I only smoke crack, I'll never be like you, smelly junkie.i feel you. i always thought it was funny how crackheads are portrayed, all playing rug doctor and shit. i thought it was a joke. well, what do you know, first time i smoked crack and i'm looking through my sweater to see if i can gather up enough rocks for another stuffie. rocks will fuck you up, quick. blow through your money, quick. put me on a mission to stroll through the mission to sample every cornerboy's girl, looking for only the "finest" of rocks. really, i just wanted a reason to smoke as much fucking crack as i could. i associated with some very strange folks because of crack.haha, yea, that's where the reference came from, i had a counsellor named franklin at my treatment center too. any chance you went to treatment in northern california? probably extremely unlikely but it would be pretty neat if we're talking about the same guy. yea, for sure, you're right. i didn't mean to suggest that it never happens. i moved to slamming heroin from my first opiate, oxy, pretty quickly. but i think for a lot of people, they start out using to counter something like pain or depression, as opposed to just jumping right in the deep end shooting dope. but yea, like you said, there are people that do.okay, but i’m more so talking about stigma and opinions, separate from knowledge of addiction. within the field of addiction, there is generally a lot of understanding and education, like you said. but, at least in my experience, people’s opinions of addicts can be pretty narrow-minded. some folks seem to see addiction as black and white. i totally agree that general societal understanding of addiction is progressing, but i think destigmatization still has a long way to go.

i live in california. people here are for the most part very open-minded. but even here on reddit, there are a lot of very strong opinions regarding addicts — i guess with the anonymity of the internet, people feel free to express these opinions.Good for you for leaving her. I can’t imagine doing heroin to cope with an unhealthy relationship. I hope you’re in a healthier place man, in both respects.I get it.GTFORofl, happy new years brother/sister!...dips on the plugHey that’s alright. 

Crack brought my life to worst points than heroin did. I did bad and shady things for both at times, together or separate but boy did crack literally bring out my crack head shit. 

And the only thing this junkie smells like is Gucci son. It’s very easy to do. I’ve definitely been there as well. If I knew I was going to be jonesing, yet had enough to make this worth doing, I’d bust a gram up into a good bit of rocks and throw them into a preswept section of carpet, so that way when I needed something to do I could carpet surf for more. Sometimes it worked great and kept me busy all night, one time I loaded up a big old rock of cookie cream and fucked up my lungs and pipe. That shit sucked. 

I’d known people that would surf at their dudes house, people would get kicks out of it. Laughing, throwing more crumbs on the floor. It’s crazy how much pride it’ll take from you for another hit. Some of the ways people would degrade themselves for a 2 minute blast is astonishing. Yeah, I see where you’re coming from. burning bridges over less than $20 since 2009Lol, sorry that was supposed to be you saying that to your friend shooting up in the bathroom from your story.

Thought it was funny how you didn't want to be a junky so only smoked crackOh and what does Gucci smell like? Vinegar? Im curiou qhat types of thing you didPricelessYeah it’s crazy how the worked out. I told myself I’d never do cocaine either, but than when it was around, and I had the money to play, it pretty much changed to I’ll never do heroin. I loved it, and that time smoking crack was fucking amazing. He gave me a blast and a half, that short lived ten minute amazing turned around to just another twenty two more times that night. I learned to go big or not play at all lol. 

He was the perfect reason to never do heroin. To not be a Gary. The place I was staying at was a duplex, 5 of us one one side, and 4 on the other, all friends or mutual friends from high school. Always partying, liquor and cocaine and k2 since I sold it and smoked it and that’s where the cash came from to keep partying. Gary needed a place to crash and it was like why not, a few people pretty much always crash here yet don’t live here, what’s one more. He said he was done with the junk. He’d already lost everything from it and was just building back up. 

And we were always trying to stay with the best coke, always buying bags, going through me or a few others, either hoping for something better or better price, it’s just good to know what’s around and establish connections. And one night Gary had the best of the deals for the girl so we gave the money to him, like three of us, and only two of us got our girl, my buddy came up 60 short because he had to swallow the bag when he got pulled over but kept the others? And Gary later that night after our suspicions were high, came out of the bathroom nodding with pinned eyes, said he got lucky and found 4 15s at his dudes. 

4x15=60. Also only swallowed one bag of blow, kept two, and found 4 15s. We collectively through him out so fast, 2 am pouring rain throwing his shit outside telling him to kick rocks. 

But boy did that fucker change my life. Cracks fucking amazing. Crack and heroin are as good as it gets. 

And boy it smells fucking amazing. Gotta get a bottle when you can. I got one for Christmas last year and have smelt good as fuck for over a year lol.
