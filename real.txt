Title: Fellow girl IV heroin users: do any of you know a lot about how heroin effects your period? I might be in some deep shit. Help :(, Content: Hey ladies :) I know there are probably more of us than I realize on this sub so hopefully someone can help me out with this. I desperately need it. 

**I know it's pretty common for a long term heroin IV habit to cause you to stop having a period. What I *dont* know and cant seem to find any info googling is if that also means you stop ovulating? Maybe I suck at googling.**

I recently started hooking up with a friend of mine and occasional running partner. He's awesome and all but...there's no fucking way I'd have a kid with him. Or anyone for that matter. I'm a junkie and (to each thier own but) I'm not bringing a child into this shit show. 

Anyway, we got a little too into it a few weeks ago and he didn't wear a condom...I know there are other huuge risks around that considering we're both addicts but that's for a different post (I'm getting tested soon). 

I've started feeling nauseous in the morning...but the new dope I've been getting can sometimes make me feel nauseous too..so..I dont know. I'm so broke rn I'm using pennies to put gas in my car so I cant afford a pregnancy test. Ive thought about lifting one but if I get caught that's lucky number 5 and a felony offense. I don't steal from stores anymore and I'm not proud I ever did. I dont want to tell my guy that I may be pregnant quite yet until I figure out how I feel about it so I'd rather not ask him to buy me a test. I'll bite the bullet and tell him though if everyone says that it's definitely possible to ovulate while shooting dope. 

It's funny because besides a very brief fling with someone else recently (shit, I sound like a hoe), I havent slept with anyone in like a year because my sex drive is so low from dope. Of course as soon as I do, boom, pregnancy scare. Fml. 

**Any knowledge or anecdotal info you guys have would be amazing. I'm kinda freaking the fuck out. Either way, keep your fingers crossed for me that I'm not pregnant** 

Thanks fam <3

**Edit :** I love this sub and I love you guys :) thanks to everyone for sharing so much of your experience and knowledge! There were even a few saints that offered to send me a pregnancy test. You guys are amazing.

So the general consensus is that some women ovulate without having a period and some don't while on heroin...and you have no way of knowing until you wind up pregnant. Fantastic. Being a woman is stressful af. 

I made an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow. I'll learn my fate then and deal with it however it goes. I'm also getting tested for Hep C and HIV. I treat myself like shit and play Russian Roulette with my life a lot. It's not good. I'm trying to curb that impulse but it's tough. 

I honestly care about the guy I'm in this thing with and he seems to care about me too so its not completely vile. I just cant imagine either of us being responsible for another human being. That's another level of recklessness that's beyond even me.

Anyway, thanks again opifam. You guys make me feel a lot less alone., ups: 121, downs: 0Op I will mail you a few tests of you want. They’re the simple strip types from amazon.Pregnancy and periods aren’t trustworthy. My friend had spotting for 6 months before she knew she discovered she was (6 months) pregnant.I don't have any answers or nothing but fukin hell this sounds stressful af... dunno which is more stress, being a girl or being a user lol.

Hope you'll be okay though.I wonder why this post is getting downvoted? I only care because it means fewer people will see this, which will make it harder for me to get the information I need. It's an honest question from someone that's been a member of this sub for years and needs help. This place used to be so supportive and helpful...I guess it's changed even more than I realized...The only thing I’ve found through a short google session is that opiates can and have effected ovulation ��‍♀️��‍♀️ also found out that if you hate having a period, methadone will make it stop. Who knew?Bodies are weird. I wouldn’t go into this assuming that you’d stop ovulating until you’re a “woman of a certain age” lol. So this is what I have for advice:

Is there planned parenthood near you? A lot of them do free services and could run a pregnancy test for you and then at least you would actually know. That’s probably your best solution to find out the answer. 

Or if you can scrounge together a dollar and chance a lot of dollar stores sell pregnancy tests now, and while I assume they’re same as the ones from like a pharmacy you might want to get it checked out at PP either way. 

I hope that you get the answers that you want and need and soon!Female - former user.. IV heroin use will eventually stop your period. It does this by impeding gonadal function, ie.. hormones like progesterone, estradiol, FSH, Luteinizing hormone and testosterone, which are what triggers ovulation and the menstrual cycle.  With this being said, it is entirely possible to still ovulate and not have a period!!  


I have met a couple of women who had gotten pregnant while using IV heroin (no periods).  I would suggest that you get a blood test.

Edit-  The hospital can give you a test.  Planned parenthood does free ones.. check your local health  dept or DHS.All I can tell you is that I have been using for 20 plus year had hardly any periods along the way and have fell pregnant 3 times. So I guess u must still ovulate even if u dont have periods. Fingers crossed for u though I totally feel u.Hey,
I’ve read a lot about this because my period stopped for a long time while using H. I know that you absolutely *can* still get pregnant while experiencing opiate-induced amenorrhea, so keep up with the birth control, condoms, and the morning after pill, if it’s not too late!

I used to think I was safe, too, until I had a scare and did a ton of research.

Stay safe!

Edit: if you want me to try to dig up the sources where I read that heroin users experiencing amenorrhea can and do still get pregnant, just comment to this and let me know.

It was a medical journal (boring) article, if that matters.The short answer is yes, you can ovulate without menstruation. I’m not a girl, nor am I a health professional, but I recall a discussion in one of my anatomy classes that this (ovulation without menstruation) can occur in 2 ways

1. The egg gets fertilized (obviously if you get pregnant you wont menstruate)

2. I’m not certain on the details of this, but if your uterine lining is blocked/scarred then the lining wont shed properly so it will appear as though you aren’t having your ‘period’, but you will still have ovulated and can therefore get pregnant.

Either way I think the course of action to take would be the same, be smart, use protection, don’t fuck up.

Also you should probably go get tested for STDs/STIs, regardless of whether or not your friend thinks he has one, he may not be showing symptoms.Hey lady, I don’t know the answer to this one, but am curious, myself. And don’t worry about “sounding like a hoe,” we are all adults here. Also- you may have some luck checking out r/heroinheroines bc it’s the opiate sub for ladies. I wish you luck. My two cents would be, dont tell the guy unless you def are pregnant. If it’s just a scare, it might not be worth it to scare him too. If you are and need assistance/support, go for it bc at that point it’s kind of his problem too (sort of). No matter how it turns out, best of luck. I haven’t had a period all year but had one scare bc I was stealthed. I took the day after pill just in case.Do you have a Planned Parenthood or similar women's health center in your city? They offer free pregnancy testing.

[Here is a study done on opioid related mentrual dysfunction in heroin addicted women.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/236938) 

Anotha one! (Full report)

https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)41173-8/pdf

ProTip: Google Scholar is your friend when it comes to shit like this.You can get a test at walmart for like 88 cents. My wife took one and now I have a 15 month old sonI think you’re gonna be okay!! I was legit in your exact same shoes- I’m clean now and still haven’t gotten normal functional lady parts. The body knows for the most part when the time isn’t right!Every body is different. My period was whack when I was using. Once I got on methadone (7/14) it took about 9 months for it to be completely normal.

About 24 months in on methadone I ended up getting Nexplanon which I absolutely love and recommend; I literally just got my 2nd one (they last 3-4 years; my first one lasted 3 but this second one will last 4 ) installed last month. The only thing that sucks is I don't get a period at all anymore but it's due to the BC. And luckily I'm not in a relationship anymore so I don't have to worry.Maybe cross post to r/heroinheroines?Been in your shoes and most of the time it’s a fluke- especially if your body is lacking vitamins... if you haven’t had a period for over a year then I’d say take a test just to be sure because it is possible. I’ve had friends that thought for 6 months that they weren’t pregnant and found out after it was too late to abort. CPS got involved it was all a really sad occurrence.. hope you figure it out girl best of luck to you in these times of tremulous nature.Girl, take a test. Yes heroin can stop ovulation (and therefore your period), but you don't want to risk not knowing, especially if you've been using. You can absolutely still get pregnant while you're using.Isn't the morning sickness thing more of a movie myth that's not really true? I wouldn't be too worried. 

Maybe you could go to a doctor to ask if he could do a test but idk I'm just guessing here no personal experience at all.

Good luck and stay safe.Just a heads up if it happens again in the future, give planned parenthood a call the next day for Plan B. Pretty sure they can give that to you at low/no cost if you qualify. Good luck!!I think the thing with ovulating and periods is that its going to be different for every woman taking heroin. My own personal experience was that I stopped using contraception with my boyfriends ( a few different ones over 18 years of iv use, I then got clean abroad,  came back, fucked my boyfriend and immediately got pregnant.  I didn't do a pregnancy test for 3 months cos I just didn't believe I could get pregnant.  Unfortunately,  I started smoking it again towards the end of the pregnancy , and have been continuing to fight my habit for another 11 years. During all those years of iv heroin use, I always had periods,  but was obviously not ovulating.  However,  I've heard of plenty of women who have become pregnant while still using.  In the UK we can hand in a urine sample to any doctors surgery or sexual health clinic  and they will do a free pregnancy test. Try googling for your area,  I realise you're in the USA but still,  they must look after some basic health care needs,  and possible pregnancy will surely be one of them. This situation will not go away and the longer you leave it, the less options you will have.  Good luck, I hope you get the result you are after. XI'm a IV user aswell so sorry that's not going to save u  . That's terrible that ur state banned abortions fucking ridiculous what if had been rape do they still expect you to have it crazy.
I was lucky because I got a water injection at the same time and when  i went to get antibiotics they told me a was pregnant else I would of missed the cut off for a termination cuz I didn't know I wasYour putting alot of stress on yourself right now which in itself will make your period late.you can actually psych yourself into having pregnancy symptoms no joke lol.  It's good you made an appointment chances are your not cause your causing so much havoc it your body your not gonna get pregnant I actually stopped getting my period for months when I was using heavy.they sell $1 dipstick pregnancy tests at all the dollar stores now, they work just as good as the $15 ones.All dollar stores have tests..scrape up a $1 and run over..Lost a shit load of weight due to various reasons, didn’t get a period for over 7 months. Had unprotected sex around my ovulation time ONCE. Got pregnant.Your local health department  an pregnancy test you for free. 

Also you wouldn't "feel" pregnant the day after intercourse. It takes like 48 hours for a fertilized egg to start it's journey to your uterus and another 3 or 4 days for it to implant. Most woman don't feel symptoms till after their first missed period.I have heard of the Asian pregnancy test.

Ok, so you insert an unresolved rubik's cube into the vagina and if it comes out solved, there's a tiny Asian inside your body.If I get pregnant while using I'd not think twice to terminate the pregnancy. Good luck hunGo to planned parenthood.  Its freeGo to a free health clinic and get a test.. Look for womankind or planned Parenthood or just a county health clinic...they could also answer your questions...but if you are pregnant is abortion an option? Just asking cause if you ask about the using prior to them testing you and find out you are and wanna keep the baby then get ready to deal with that shit show too..dfacs all up in your life and potentially losing custody at birth. .just some things rk consider. I'm pro choice so either way IDC what u do just wanted the info there.This might be the wake up call both of you needed. Something to get clean for. I know if I would have had a child, I'd have quit everything long ago. But alas, it never happened and I've been in the methadone clinic for over 13 years. I just recently got arrested for my 1st time since 2006 for DUI, but it's a bogus charge because the only reason I was arrested was because I failed the field sobriety test due to having an issue with my legs (I was actually on my way to the ER when I got pulled over and was diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis the next day). But admittedly, I have been abusing my take-homes for years. This DUI is my wake up call. Hopefully I beat it and can move on and change for the better.  I truly believe things happen for a reason.opiates heavily affect men’s testosterone levels from long term use so i can’t see why it wouldn’t affect females, i really hope OP gets the answers cuz i’d be freaking out tooIt’s posts like this I thank my lucky stars I was born with a meat rocket instead of a ham wallet.Good luck � and keep us updated �I'm a dude but they had pregnancy tests for like a dollar at my local Walmart.  Although pennies for gas may mean that doesnt help.  Sorry, felt compelled to chime in lol.  Glad everyones been so helpful.  Addicts are more generous than any other group of people I know besides just others that have been through really tough problems.My home girl didn't have her period and she still got pregnant and had a kid when she was usingJust get a pregnancy test,only a couple of dollars here and you can get them in supermarkets.
I think for the peace of mind a negative test will provide is well worth kt.
Maybe tests are really expensive where your at,is there no free well woman clinics,again one more benefit of public health system we have here,contraception ,everything.
I really hope it works out for the best,take care.Holy shit dude hope you not preggo and just be careful in the future! Raising a tiny human is life changing but yea you gota be somewhat stable. Anyways planned parenthood? They do tests for free.

Best of luck OP!Maybe Tracy would be able to help (at least for the future) with a harm reduction pack? I can't tag from my app?
Also, I am in the South as well and there are pregnancy tests at Dollar Tree.It was a bit difficult at the time and it comes up now and again but I know I made the right decision.  I'm mean what kid want a junkie for a parent. That's what u have to tell yourself its completely rational. Try not to work urself up until u know for sure. I've had to make the decision 3 times and it's not a pleasant procedure. Finally sorted myself with a implant. One of those times I had a coil and the other 2 I used condoms so I was really unlucky. Hopefully ur not as unlucky as me but if you are trust that u know ur own mind and what's best for u personally. Good luckMy homeboys girl just recently had a baby and they were heavy heroin iv users so yea it’s possible to get preggo whole shooting dope.Hey girl just wanted to let you know I'm hoping everything works out for you luv. Whatever way things go, the decision you make will be the right decision. 

I only get a few periods a year too. They always come back. Good luck and lots of love from "just another one of us" xxoxoMy wife doesn't get her period for months and months. She's actually gone over a year while using without getting it. Still take a pregnancy test though.Unusual periods seem to be a very common symptom among opioid addicted females on reddit.Good luck with everything. Take care of yourself. If you need to vent I will gladly listen. If you want advice i will try my best☺.Best of luck tomorrow, sending hugs your wayGet a one dollar pregnancy test from the dollar treeOp I hope everything goes smoothly �

Update us pleaseWell if you sound like a hoe then..the glove fits 

Seriously if you are going to be the least bit responsible about something do it when concerting bringing another life onto this planet. 

You seem to realize you are in no condition nor have the ability to take care of a child so be responsible. There are free pregnancy tests that are offered by non profits and similar. I’m not trying to knock you but if you could read what you type as someone besides yourself I have a hard time imagining you would think any different. 

It takes 5 seconds to prevent a lifetime of pain and regret/sorrow. Just because you haven’t made good life choices doesn’t mean you can’t start. 

And eventually you will become fertile again but pregnancy isn’t something you should ho-hum guess and shrug about 

There are resources available to help broke people.  You just have to not be to stupidly proud to ask.

If a dude doesn’t want to wear protection then don’t spread your legs for him the kids should be the least of your worries if you are a needle user. 

Telling a guy no is a lot easier than explaining to your grown child years later that he got hep-c or worse because momma didn’t want to inconvenience the sperm donor.  Isn’t it easier to use protection than go have an abortion?  I totally understand that opiates mess with your judgement and decision making but at some point if someone wants anything to change they can’t use being high as a convenient excuse to be impulsive and reckless.

There are definite signs you can tell if you are pregnant after six weeks but you need to be coherent and know your body, cause it will change a lot. Bigger droopier boobs etc etc but being on the smack will keep you from noticing most anything.Aw, thanks so much homie! That's so, so cool of you to offer <3 I actually just found a clinic near me that offers free tests. I made an appointment for tomorrow. I'm terrified but I need to bite the bullet and find out what I'm dealing with..hopefully nothing but a little nausea from the dope...Thanks for replying :)

I know the correlation is weak at best. Just because I dont have a period doesnt mean no ovulation too. I was just wondering if anyone knew or had read that heroin *also* stops ovulation? Or if it doesnt have any effect on ovulation and only effects whatever causes the uterine lining to shed (*gag*).Lol, it is stressful homie. I mean I'm fully aware it's my own damn fault but this is what I do..act impulsively, get myself into a world of shit, freak out, then somehow weasel my way out of it by some crazy fucking miracle. Rinse, repeat. One day I'm going to run outta miracles but I'm hoping this isn't the time...

It's loads of fun being me /sAnd thanks for the well wishes btw. I'm really worried and it's nice to hear something kind :)Possibly bot or people who are just dicks. Good luck by the way. For anyone reading this post down the line, I'd be willing to send anyone a pregnancy test if you are ever in this situation.Glad to see this post isn't being downvoted at the time of this comment, your post and your question are exactly what this sub is supposed to be here for: help and safety for other users. People can be assholes, but this sub has always felt more communal than any other to me, and I'm glad that the majority of us seem to be supportive.

As for your problem, I unfortunately don't have much in the way of advice or anything that hasn't already been offered. But I hope this is just a small scare and that everything works out. Stay safe, yo.Interesting, if you dont mind me asking, what did you google to find that? I'm shit at searching. I know dope stops periods for some women but didnt know methadone does too. *The more you know* 

I wish suboxone had the same effect lol. Unfortunately, the few times I've been sober and on it for MAT I've started having my period again. So far, I've always relapsed before it has had a chance to level out and become regular again though :/ so I havent had a regular, full period in over 5 years...

Thanks for the reply :)They are weird, aren't they? I live in the conservative south who has been at war with planned parenthood, unfortunately. I did find one free clinic nearby and made an appointment for tomorrow, yikes. Whatever it is, I'll figure it out. I always seem to somehow lol. Thanks for the well wishes fam <3Damn, yeah I'm seeing that's the general consensus. I've made an appointment with a free clinic for tomorrow. I'm going to get tested for Hep C and HIV too if they offer it. I'm already doing something terrifying tomorrow..might as well go all in. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I was planning on going into an inpatient facility this week to give getting sober another try. Not gonna happen if I'm pregnant. Anyway, thanks for the reply :)Damn, alright well then that tells me theres at least a chance I'm still ovulating then. I'm going to look for a clinic that'll give me a free pregnancy test. There have got to be some, even in the conservative south east....

And thanks for the well wishes. I'm going to need it if the test is positive. The state I'm in has all but banned abortions so I'd have to travel out of state to get one if that's what I decide. Yikes.Btw, I'm curious what your ROA is when using? I know IV use has more negative physical effects so I wonder if it does more damage, making it less likely I still ovulate..

Thanks again, girl :)Hey girl! You're awesome, thanks so much for sharing. Every reply so far confirms what you said, lol. So you don't need to go through digging up the article, thanks so much for offering! I have appointment for a free pregnancy test at the city clinic so...I'll find out tomorrow. Yikes. And you stay safe out there too! <3Yup already on it. Like I said, i treat myself pretty poorly. I've been suicidal off and on for years but am trying to turn a corner. It's something I'm working on and this mistake has set me back a lot. It'll be even worse if I am in fact pregnant. Anyway, I made an appointment with a free clinic for tomorrow to get tested for Hep C and HIV as well as the pregnancy test.Yeah, I'm getting nasty messages calling me everything under the sun but "hoe", "whore" and "slut" seems to be thier 3 favorite insults. I knew it was coming so I'm trying not to let it bother me. 

I don't plan on telling him unless I'm sure and even then, I'm not sure I want to tell him if I am...I dont know how I feel about that though. I'm torn because part of me feels he has an equal right to know but at the same time, he's the type that would want me to keep it. Theres no way I'm ever considering that..so why put him through that heartbreak and in turn, make it harder for me to stick to that choice and go through with it? We were friends first so I know him pretty well. My fear is that he'll start talking about getting sober again so we can be a family and all of that. I'm not confident enough in either of us to get sober and stay that way for any real amount of time. Entertaining that idea is just setting everyone involved up for disappointment. Maybe that's cynical, but..I think I'm just being realistic. 

>I haven’t had a period all year but had one scare bc I was stealthed. 

What's stealthed mean? I've never heard that before. I think I know..but I hope I'm wrong...Wow, thanks for the info. You're like a google ninja lol. Basically the consensus in both reports are: some women ovulate without a period on heroin, some dont. And there's essentially no way to know which one you are unless you wind up pregnant lol. Fantastic.

And no planned parenthood near me because I'm in a ultra conservative southern state, unfortunately. It sucks. I did find a free clinic that's similar and made an appointment for tomorrow. They dont do abortions there but I can at least find out what's up and take it from there. I'm crossing my fingers it's the dope making me nauseous. Thanks again homie! <3Whaat? Are they really that cheap?! I went to cvs and they were all $10 and up. It was hard not to just boost that shit but I didnt. I'm trying really hard to curb my junkie impulses. It's just, how can something you pee on be so damn expensive?

Anyway, thanks for the reply :) I have an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow so I'll find out then. Yikes.

Congratulations on the baby btw! :)I made an appointment at a free clinic just in case. They offer free pregnancy tests so no harm no foul if I'm not pregnant but if I am at least I'll know and can make a choice about what to do.Nexplanon FOSHO! I got the 5 year Norplant (back when that was available) at the Health Department, in different Southern state at no charge, then when that ran out I got Nexplanon which is 3+ years.Didn’t know this sub existed. Thanks for sharing :)Omg, how'd I forget about this sub? Thanks for the reminder! <3Yeah, I'm not super healthy rn so I'm def lacking vitamins. I'm underweight now and havent had a full, regular period in..like 3 years. Yikes. Getting tested tomorrow at the free clinic. If its positive, I'll have to find a way out of my state to a less conservative one for an abortion. I cant go through that and I cant put an innocent child through it either. I dont know what itll do to me mentally but it's the right thing to do in my eyes. I shouldn't be a parent. Thanks for the well wishes love!I have an appointment tomorrow at a free clinic in the city so I'll find out then..I'm so nervous I feel like I'm going to puke. Anyway, thanks for the reply :) I appreciate it!Morning sickness does actually exist! Some people don’t have it as bad as others though! :)Morning sickness is a very real and gross part of early pregnancy for many women.I've never been pregnant before so I haven't experienced it first and but several of my girlfriends have gotten pregnant over the years and most of them complained about "morning sickness" even though they didnt just feel nauseous in the morning. It was usually of and on all day. Which is kinda how I've been feeling. It's worse in the morning but also comes and goes throughout the day. Smells are really intense right now for some reason. Like, crazy sensitive. I'm like a bloodhound, lol. It's weird. I dunno. I've always been a little sensitive to smells. Anyway, thanks! Be safe too homie <3Yes! I wish I would've thought of that at the time. I was strung out and not thinking but I'm working on making better choices. Thanks for the reply :)Yeah the new law is all kinds of fucked up.  It completely removes all agency from women and places the importance of the fetus over her life and wellbeing. Like we're incapable of making that choice for ourselves so they feel they should step in and make it for us. It's Orwellian and fucking wrong. 

I'm glad fate intervened for you and you were able to make a decision for yourself about what to do. I'm terrified of having to make that choice. Was it tough for you mentally or emotionally? I know its different for every woman I'm just trying to get a feel for what to expect afterward, if that is something I have to do. Because if I'm pregnant then I'm definitely getting an abortion. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to have it then give it up for adoption and keeping it is completely out of the question so...Son of a bitch. That's word for word what happened to me without the pregnancy....yet? What'd you end up doing about it? If you dont me askingOh, it's been weeks since our slip up happened. We were pretty blasted at the time too so I didn't really think much about it afterward. Then I started feeling nauseous and it came back to me. It was an, "oh God. No." moment for me. I'm stupidly impulsive and reckless. I'm hoping the damage this time is minimal. 

And I made an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow so I'll find out soon what's up. I'd have to go to a different state for an abortion so I'm praying that's not the case.Lmao, borderline racist but I still laughed. Thanks for that, I needed it :)I'm *definitely* in agreement with you on that. It's going to be really fucking hard but it's the right thing to do.There isnt one anywhere near me. Ultra conservative southern states be like that.Already ahead of you :) I made an appointment for tomorrow at a free clinic. Abortion is definitely the way I'd go if it turns out I'm pregnant. It absolutely breaks my heart and it's probably going to fuck me up for a bit but I'd rather suffer that devastation than bring a child into my shitshow of a life. No kid deserves me as a parent lol. Logistics of actually getting one is scary because I'm in an ultra conservative state and abortion is illegal here after 6 weeks. Which is absurd. Who tf knows they're pregnant before 6 weeks?! Anyway, I'll figure out a way to get to a more tolerant state if need be. I won't go the back alley abortion route or anything. Lwts hope that's not the case tho :/I definitely see where you're coming from and that thought crossed my mind, for sure. But then reality hit me. I've gone to 9 different inpatient rehabs. A bunch of out patients, detox countless times, groups, therapy, etc, trying to get sober. I've failed every time so far. I'm not saying its impossible for me to get sober. Its definitely possible and I'll keep trying until I find something that works or I'm dead but I just cant in good conscience gamble the wellbeing of a child on my ability to get sober. Those stakes are way too high and then if I fail, it's not just me anymore that suffers the consequences of relapsing...it's an innocent child that didn't choose this shit. I just cant do that, you know?

Sometimes things just happen and they're not fate they're just mistakes. I need to believe that's what's happening for me.Thanks doll <3There it is. I knew there would be at least *one* judgemental prick that would show up and call me a slut because I had sex with a close friend of mine and, one of those times, didn't use protection. It was a reckless choice not having him wear a condom. I was pretty clear about that from the jump. So no need to slut shame me. 

Also, what the fuck are even talking about here:

>Seriously if you are going to be the least bit responsible about something do it when concerting bringing another life onto this planet. 

>You seem to realize you are in no condition nor have the ability to take care of a child so be responsible. There are free pregnancy tests that are offered by non profits and similar. I’m not trying to knock you but if you could read what you type as someone besides yourself I have a hard time imagining you would think any different. 

Where in my post did I say anything about wanting to be pregnant? Or anything about keeping it if I am? Why are lecturing me like this post is about me wanting to keep a pregnancy that I'm not even sure exists yet? 

I wouldn't have posted this if I wasnt concerned about the situation and confused about what to do. If you missed the part where I said I'm literally counting pennies to pay for gas. I'm jobless and essentially couch surfing. Picking up a pregnancy test isnt something I thought I could afford because I wasnt finding anything less than $10. I live in an ultra conservative state. There aren't any planned parenthoods anywhere near me. I did find a free clinic though to at least take a test. They dont perform abortions there tho and because the one time I had unprotected sex with him was more than 6 weeks ago..it'd be illegal in my state to have an abortion for me now. I'll find a way though. 


>It takes 5 seconds to prevent a lifetime of pain and regret/sorrow. Just because you haven’t made good life choices doesn’t mean you can’t start. 

Thanks for chastising me. I dont already feel bad enough about myself so I definitely needed the extra kick while I'm down. Nicely done. 

>And eventually you will become fertile again 

That's not how women work. Abortions dont cause you to be infertile. Unless something goes terribly wrong. 

>but pregnancy isn’t something you should ho-hum guess and shrug about 

Yeah, me spending time researching on my own and not finding any conclusive answers then taking time to write this post then time to reply to every single person that was kind enough to help is definitely me being ambivalent about the situation. You caught me.

>If a dude doesn’t want to wear protection then don’t spread your legs for him the kids should be the least of your worries if you are a needle user. 

>Telling a guy no is a lot easier than explaining to your grown child years later that he got hep-c or worse because momma didn’t want to inconvenience the sperm donor. Isn’t it easier to use protection than go have an abortion? I totally understand that opiates mess with your judgement and decision making but at some point if someone wants anything to change they can’t use being high as a convenient excuse to be impulsive and reckless.

How's the air up there in your ivory tower in the land where no one makes mistakes and everyone is perfect? Bet it's nice. Down here in reality it's a little more complicated than where you're from so let me explain what it's like here. 

I already have said countless times that I'm extremely reckless and irresponsible. The reason for my behavior is rooted in the fact that I have bipolar disorder and PTSD. My impulse control is non existent but its something I constantly fight against. I said in my post that I treat myself poorly. I know this. Its something I'm also working on but not having much luck with. It's also something that I'm constantly suffering consequences from so no need to tell me. I feel the pain of my stupid actions every fucking day. 

It's not  being high that makes me reckless. I'm high *because* I'm reckless. I've been to 9 different rehabs. I've attempted the 12 steps 4 times. All of this while being unmedicated for bipolar disorder because we havent found a combination of meds that work for me yet. I cant explain how frustrating it is to know that I'm fucking up and actively trying **so hard** to not be the way I am but constantly failing. Its exhausting and makes me feel desperation, anger and despair.

None of these are excuses but until I find medication that can help me get out of my own way, I dont think I'm capable of being fully functional. Anyway, I dont know why I'm bothering to reply to you. You just hit a bunch of my buttons and I couldnt not say something. 

By the way, this is a sub for drug addicts. In case you weren't aware. If you're going to lecture every person that's made a bad decision, you're going to stay pretty busy...maybe you should save yourself some time and fuck off to a different sub.Wow. This response. Are you even serious? Or are you just an asshole? OP found a free clinic and she expressed her understanding of the seriousness of her situation. Maybe try and realize she was reaching out for support and not hate after she made a mistake. I guess you don’t know what that’s like huh?Yeah, I kinda expected to get torn apart for posting this here but I needed to talk about this and ask questions to people that *may* understand where I'm coming from and what it's like. The responses were overwhelmingly kind. The negative ones though...are rough. You should see the awful shit in my inbox. I underestimated how terrible the negative responses would make me feel. 

The kind responses and the offers like yours to send a pregnancy test have been really amazing though. I'm trying to focus on those instead :) I've got an appointment at a free clinic tomorrow. The consensus was that it's possible that I'm pregnant even without a period so better safe than sorry. Thanks for the reply homie. Stay safe :)I tried several phrases but the one that was a score was : does heroin stop ovulation

And you’re welcome. I hope that you get it figured outGood luck! And this absolutely could just be scare and your fine. You’re doing a lot of things that could cause similar pregnancy symptoms and stress also makes weird things happen. So I will absolutely cross my fingers for you that you get the outcome you want. I would definitely want an update after tomorrow if you feel comfortable doing that. 

And that’s why I asked if there was one nearby because the state of the US and planned parenthood is decidedly rocky at this pointIn the great white north, the pregnancy tests from dollarama are 2 or 3 dollars. I have been told by a nurse friend that they are the same ones they use at the hospitals! 

I'm sorry about the state of abortion in your state... If people don't believe in it, that's fine; but nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your own body. The USA makes me sad.If you are pregnant, they may put you on buprenorphine, which, won't be the worst thing. You can always stay on a small dose, like,  under 4 mg a day, and taper off after the baby is born. Should you choose to follow through with the pregnancy, staying clean is going to be something you would have to do.  As a mother of three, I can honestly say that my kids force me to be a better person than I could ever possibly have been without them.  

Babies are not all rainbows and butterflies,  but they are quite literally the only thing on this planet that you will love deeply and truly.  I had no idea what love was (thought I did) until my first child was born. After he was born, my entire world shifted on its axis and suddenly,  I was no longer afraid of anything for myself. I knew I could do anything at all to ensure his safety and well being. 


I hope all goes well tomorrow with all your tests!! Even if you end up testing + for the HIV/Hep C, its devastating,  but with current medical treatments, you would stand a much higher chance of survival and even remission than you would have a decade ago.   I had HIC/Hep C tests done every 6 months for almost a decade after I found out that one of the guys I had slept with was supposedly HIV/Hep C positive.   Scary ass shit for sure.. and it sucked ass having to tell every future partner that it was a possibility.  Thankfully,  I have never had a positive result. I am sure you will be ok too!I’m glad you’ve got an appointment. I know how nerve-wracking it can be though. If you need someone to chat with who has been through it, give me a shout. I’ll reply if I’m awake <3It’s your body and your decision. Whatever you think is best, since you know him well. My best friend hid a terminated pregnancy from her bf at the time and it worked out all for the best. You just do what is best for you. 
And fuck all those people calling names, they are clearly too immature to understand that adults have sex. There’s nothing immoral or indecent about it. 
Stealthing is when the guy takes the condom off without you knowing. I caught it, but it was already too late and he def got some thrusts into me bare. It’s essentially sexual assault since I did not consent to it. I freaked out after and took plan b bc I didn’t want to risk any pregnancy.
Good luck and keep me posted! I had an abortion a few years ago, if you need anyone to talk to about it, PM meNo problem at all! Hope it is nothing more than a scare for you, good luck!Sounds good. It sounds like you are having a lot of pregnancy symptoms, so I'm glad you're testing immediately. 

If you are pregnant and need support, feel free to reach out, no matter what choice you decide to make. 

I got pregnant with my first very early in sobriety and ended up relapsing after baby #3. I'm currently clean, but it's been a struggle.Hopefully not the case but Nashville Tennessee if it is the case and also ask about the pill one instead of the procedure it's less invasive and cheaper.First off you said you sounded like a slut not me.  All I did was validate your own words. Second you came here asking for advice I didn’t ask you. I never mentioned having a baby and keeping it but unless you lack some basic sense getting pregnant is a likely outcome of unprotected intercourse.  And you say that you had no intention of getting pregnant nor keeping the baby if you did well then there is no good excuse to not take basic precaution and use protection to minimize the risk of getting pregnant(contraception and condoms cost nothing if you go to at risk centers similar places/shelters)

You talk of all these negative consequences and bad decisions you’ve made and likely have continually made but show only regret and self loathing and pity instead of things you could do to make your situation in life better, you for instance want to have an abortion instead of avoiding the decisions you made to get to that point and then when someone like me points out the obvious I get crucified as a dick. Which is fine I really don’t care, you’ve probably had people coddle you and have learned that by playing the victim and pity card you insulate yourself from criticism until someone stops enabling you. Consider yourself lucky you have a car to put change in the gas tank, I learned that no matter how bad I think I have it there is always someone who has it worse.  I lived out of my car until it was stolen and sold for scrap then I was homeless.  So while you can find sympathy from some here most of the time you will find the opposite too because most everyone here has been there and done that. So I’ll leave the sympathy angle for those that are good at it. 

But a lot of people that don’t know addiction inside and out won’t deal with the type of manipulations and stuff addicts do because they’ve done it themselves. 

You didn’t mention anything about keeping it you just casually act as if it’s more of a burden on you to be responsible and use protection than it would be to have an abortion. 

I’m not lecturing you about keeping it, obviously it’s a lecture about being a responsible adult and judging by your admitted decision making you are incapable or unwilling to do so. 

You wouldn’t even be in your situation had you been the tiniest bit responsible   I’m not the most responsible person but I’m more so than I used to be once I realized that the inconvenience of having the tiniest bit of responsibility is a lot less harmful than dealing with the outcome of bad decision. 

I’m not chastising your it’s called advice, obciously you want to play the victim because that makes you immune to needing to take responsibility for your own decisions in life. 

We all have our issues,  but not everyone here is going to coddle you because at some point a lot of us have had to be responsible and fix ourselves because denial was just perpetuating the bad outcomes. 
Meh at do you want a pat on the back and congrats for being completely selfish?


I’m not lecturing everyone that comes thru here and you don’t me just as I don’t know you I didn’t make any assumptions I just went off the info you voluntarily divulged. 

 I was on all kinds of benzos and amphetamines legitimately prescribed and always told myself my addiction to pills are getting worse and I can only make it two weeks instead of four on the same amount of pills because my dick doctor won’t prescribe me my psych meds anymore.  

No combination of pills is going to magically make everything better( maybe just easier temporarily ) it is a bandaid for a bullet wound you say things like you won’t get any better until you find x combination of medicine and that it sucks waking up being a fuckup.  Yeah we all know that here, and some of us have gotten past the point of feeling sorry for ourselves and realized that the mentality  of victim hood gets people nowhere except further down the same tubes of the same cycle. 

I don’t know if you’ve had tough love or not so it’s worth a try is it not?  Not everyone is gonna to tell you what you want to hear but some will tell you what you need to hear. 

The problem isn’t with access to abortion clinics or being in a conservative state or being undermedicated. It is the mentality that you continue to try to fix the symptom instead of the disease.  Lack of abortion resources or money to have one isn’t the problem it’s that you think that having an abortion is your first and best option whereas had you made better decisions you wouldn’t even be in that situation to begin with. 

And you are in denial because making good decisions is a lot harder than just dealing with the symptom of making bad decisions. 

Saying you know you make bad decisions and feeling like a fuckup isn’t going to get you anywhere admitting it is the easy part now you have to do something about it to change it

Life is hard. Especially with addiction , I wouldn’t be here had I not already been thru everything I’ve just mentioned. 

Look at it this way if this sub is your opiate family then someone needs to be the asshole uncle/brother/sister/cousin. Otherwise it just would be unrealisticI'm here for you, I don't have any answers but sometimes it is just good to know another woman out there is rooting for you. Love and light.Awesome, I'll use that to do some more research myself. I got an anecdotal comment from another user though that said she got pregnant 3 times while using opiates. She didnt specify her ROA though and I think that does make a difference when it comes to how it effects you physically. Either way, I think I'm going to just focus on finding a free clinic that'll do a free pregnancy test for me. And thanks, I'll figure something out. I'm nothing if not resourceful lol.Yeah, I can definitely update you tomorrow. That's sweet that you care to know what happens to me :)

>the state of the US and planned parenthood is decidedly rocky at this point

It sucks. I'm in a state where you can't get an abortion after 6 weeks too...who the hell knows they're pregnant before 6 weeks?! Its ludicrous. I hope they over turn it in the supreme court but until then, if it is the worst outcome, I'll have to travel to another state. It discriminates against women that don't have those means. It's disgusting. Anyway, sorry for the rant. I get super heated about that topic.apparently methadone is recommended for pregnancy while suboxone is considered more dangerous for the babyI feel like gold means a lot more on this sub hahah damn whos throwin $5 around like that Cool, Nashville is fairly close to me and I think my guy and I can find a way to get up there if we have to. Thats funny you mentioned it because I was just reading about the pill option. It definitely sounds like the better option for me if it comes to that. Mentally, I don't think I could get through the procedure. Apparently, you're awake for it and the machine makes a bunch of noise. No way I'd get through that. Thanks for the tip, hopefully I wont need it thoughWhat's even more crazy, is men are making these decisions for women's.Oh I hear ya! Right there with ya sista! And then all the stuff that’s going on in Ohio about “trying” to reimplant ectopic pregnancies and the new charges they could bring against doctors and shit. They’re all losing their minds. 

I got pregnant while using and used the whole pregnancy so I just want to support a fellow lady in their time of need!Buprenorphine without the naloxone is often given in lieu of methadone in the area that I live in. As long as it does not have nalaxone in it, it should be fine.I am not sure but I am appreciative of it! I cannot imagine that many users would have money to throw around, so yeah. It means a lot more here!Yup that's the worst partWhat?! I hadnt heard about that in Ohio! Are they out their goddamn minds? When did believing in God start to mean playing God by taking a pregnancy that isn't viable and *forcing* it to be viable? Aren't they supposed to believe in God's design and all that shit? Wow. That blows my mind. 

And thanks for the support, love! nothing about any of this is black and white, good or bad. Its complicated and messy. I'm pretty sure I wouldnt choose to keep it if I'm pregnant because, for me, I just can't bring a child into my life. I'm a shitshow. But it would be devastating for me to make that choice. I hope I dont have to. I understand why women in our situation make the choice they do, either way, because your heart pulls you in both directions. It's hard. I hope you and the baby are doing well now <3The abortion debate is just so baffling to me. I can't wrap my head around the fact that so many people have this archaic, whacky point of view about it. 
For one, any legislation that tries to govern what you can do with your body (as long as you're not hurting others) is trash. Just like drug laws. 
Humans dont even start counting their life's age until after they're born, yet pro-lifers call it "murder" even though that "person" isnt even a person yet. 
And then they ridicule and shame women who've had abortions, as if they dont already feel terrible. Its like going up to somebody who just had to euthanize their pet and calling them a murderer and showing them pictures of dead animals. Who the fuck does that? Not only is it an unfortunate situation to be in, but the pro-lifers aren't the ones who have to deal with it.Yeah you can’t actually reimplant an ectopic pregnancy. Like it just can’t happen. But yeah they’re all nuts there. That bill just happened this week (they presented it) so it’s been very ��‍♀️. 

And yes we’re good now. She’s been back in my custody for just over a year now and I’m done with all the CPS stuff as of this September so yay! But it was also the kick in the pants I needed to stop all the crazy.>Yeah you can’t actually reimplant an ectopic pregnancy. Like it just can’t happen. But yeah they’re all nuts there. That bill just happened this week (they presented it) so it’s been very ��‍♀️. 

I was wondering how the hell that would even be possible. I'm relieved to hear its not something they're actually trying to do. 

That's awesome to hear that you're doing well! I'm glad you were able to conquer this shit and your daughter is with you again where she belongs :)

I'm planning on checking into rehab in the next few weeks myself pending a few scholarships I've applied for the attend a program. I have no insurance or money lol so I'm hoping someone will believe enough that I can get sober to let me into a program at little to no cost. We'll see.

Keep up the great work you're doing! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Does the opiates panel on drug tests include fentanyl?, Content: Quick question! Does the “opiates” panel on a 12 panel at home piss test include fentanyl? Or is it just codeine/heroin/morphine/etc..Thanks!, ups: 4, downs: 0if you get an at home test youll come up negative assuming its straight fent your doing.at home tests dont test for fentanyl unless it’s directly for fentNot usually on a 12 panel. Perhaps on a 15? The opiates panel is only for actual "opiates" and it will not detect synthetics like oxycodone, oxymorphone, fentanyl,  buprenorphine or methadone. Mainly morphine, codiene and hydromorphone and hydrocodone. Hydrocodone and hydromorphone are only detected in the opiates assay because of their metabolites, dihydrocodeine, norcodiene, normorphine and the like.ur golden , juss be careful bro mane theres fents out there that narcan cant touchThis if it's a at home one it most likely won't pop for fentOkay awesome thanks! It doesn’t have fent on the panelWow science girls do rock! Thank you so much lolThank yall for the replys! I hope it was straight fent it was a pressed mbox lol �I forgot to mention that hydrocodone is a pro-drug for hydromorphone, so, hydromorphone is a metabolite of hydrocodone, one of the main ones, actually. 

Thank you!Yes your good lol I used to pass every single one doing those the presses @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Outdated cough syrup help, Content: Ok maybe a weird place to ask but it does involve an opiate.

I have a very old cough juice bottle containing ethylmorphine, and its my last bottle. The problem is that the little cough juice that is left has been separated into layers, where most if not all of the active ingredients are either on top or on the bottom of the bottle in a crystal, wet powder mix. 

So my question is: Do you know a good method to make it a drinkable solution again? If not, how would I consume it? Thanks in advance!

Also for further reference: I live in Sweden and we have all our cough juice on receipt and you actually have to go to a doctor to get a new reciept, which I don't really bother to because I only use it to get to sleep when I'm on speed., ups: 4, downs: 0Sounds amazing, it’s probably a lot more potent since it’s old.I would say shake that bitch to mix it all back together and then chug itWhy would that increase potency? I have no knowledge on the subject, just curious. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: My girlfriend went through my wallet, Content: She said she wanted to clean it out. She found three different casino membership cards, psychiatrist’s card, sub doctor, my attorney’s business card (she didn’t notice it was tar stained), some card for the suicide hotline, old condom. Oh and the debit card they give you when you get out of jail. Like I walked into jail with a bunch of cash and when I walk out I expect the cash you asshole, instead I get handed some bullshit card. 

I’ve been clean for a long time so I just didn’t expect my wallet to make me look like such a degenerate. At least the needle exchange membership card wasn’t there anymore. Only other thing amiss is there’s actually a bunch of money in it these days. 


Anyway, if you ever think you can’t get out and live a semi-normal life, you can, and you’ll get there. But it’s funny to see these reminders of how you used to be., ups: 141, downs: 0The jail keeps your money here, they apply towards your bill. I would rather get a card lolYou know your not doing well when your rockin the food stamps card in your wallet.The jail here gives 41$s a day towards your magistrate level fines. If you have fines through the clerk of courts and have a warrant with them then you can either Get work release or set up payment arrangements if they are willing to let you go If the fines are Not to high. Anyways, if you go with cash you get a card when you leave. It used to be that if you went with cash they would print you out a check and then you could cash it across the street at the bank and if you didn't have an ID it would be ok. They would cash it anyways.The jail takes half of whatever cash you had when you were taken inDump her for going thru your walletHow considerate they are of the working man...Lol that’s funny. I remember when my mom and I cleaned out my purse and there was like 50 needles and 3 burned spoons and my sharps card, and omg when I cleaned out my car I just about cried. There was little brown stains everywhere, from checking if my needles were clogged by squirting them a bit, I couldn’t get them all but luckily it just looked like spilled soda. I ended up giving my sharps card to a friend when I got on methadone because I wanted her to start using smart and she wasn’t comfortable with going and getting her own sharps card (giving her name and shit). And in my state all you have to do is show them the card, you don’t have to provide proof of ID or anything. (It’s probably that way everywhere.I love this post <3Haha thanks for sharing. Pretty sure I’ve got 3/4 of those cards still in my wallet too. (Subs doc, attorney & psych) ... gonna just go ahead and throw those out now while I’m thinking about it! Not like I can’t just google them. Will be hanging on to the bail bond receipt to get that $$ back though lol.If my gf tried going through my shit. Id tell that girl its straight plasma centers, needles exchanges, a solid list of numbers with names that are obviously not real, gotta  say I was a frequent flyer at taco Bell if you know what I mean. 

Bitch you suspicious here ya go, I shoot heroin and like it. That's a first world problem. Wanna go through it sure, you know what to expect. Sorry prostitutes got good connects. Get with the game hoe, you about to turn a trick before you can even blink.

Edit: lawyer is on speed dial, money speaks apparentlyBill? What bill? I’ve never heard of you having to pay for jail.Same hereAlright I concede that is beyond fucked hahahaYou get your bail money back if you dont go thru a bondsmenOh shit!! Lmao I lost my EBT card back in 2013 and just never bothered getting a new one. How could I forget about thatMy county gives you a check for your cash less jail rent. The problem is that they release you at 12:01 am. Where can you find a check cashing place that late?What does that mean exactly? 41$ a day towards your fines? Is the they charge you $41 a day up to the amount of your fine and then you don't get charged more? I'm just now learning that jails are charging people to be locked up there like it's the fucking Knights Inn or some shit. This really makes me angry that they charge you to be in jailWhat the fuck? "Get with the game hoe, you about to turn a trick before you can even blink" is that how you treat your girlfriend? ChrissakeThey charge us 
$31 a day to stay at their lovely jailI went to jail with no money and left with a fucking bill.Here they charge you $17 if you bring cash into jail. It covers the cost of underwear, a white T-shirt, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste and socks and shower shoes and your net bag. It probably costs them $8 for all of it.Ok. I know it's probably karma suicide. As someone who was lucky enough to never get caught up in the dirt I did as a younger and more strung out version of myself; I can say that I have never been to jail. THANK GOD. But, I can't be mad that they actually charge the inmate to stay there. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what it costs taxpayers to support an inmate. Free medical care, meals, etc. are things we could all get used to. I just think it is important to think about our struggling veterans and senior citizens, who are having to choose between eating and insulin before being so pissed that an inmate isn't getting a full free ride. U/deslondes704, this isn't directed at you. I just stopped on your comment and responded.Yes it isHere in Germany you get money for every day you are there. I think its 30€. I never went to jail but some friends of me. Thats super fucked up to pay for staying at a fucking jail.What the fuck? They kick you out at midnight? That’s fucked. That has problems written all over it if you don’t have someone who can get you cab or otherwise. And no money...It was a joke on a fucking sub reddit. Don't get your panties in a knotch. No harm intended. I treat women like women should be, with up most respect. I thought the joke was appropriate for the situation but indeed now I am the asshole. Sure, I'll own it.You from the States? It's all such a cash cow for them it's disgusting, not to mention crooked as fuck. I actually feel for everyone who lives there.Fuck that. Guess when I file bankruptcy do to an extreme medical bill down the line I’ll just add that to the chpt 7.Is it one of those private for profit jails? Or are those only prisons? What do they do if you can't pay, they can't hold you longer can they? What the fuck type of country do I live in that we charge people to go to jail. Now I've never been myself but I've read about it on here and I love watching those lock up shows on MSNBC. They charge an arm and a leg to call your family, I see that now in some places you don't even get in person visits, its in front of a video screen and I'm sure they charge for that...

With each and everyday it becomes clearer and clearer that the rich in my country are out to fuck the poor any which way. They will step over you and put thier boot on your neck to get another dollar. Fuck that man, i am sorry to hear thatThat's cheap! They charge $50 here!I did a county year and they tried to bill me like 20 k lmaoThat's more than my rent.In Arizona it’s almost 200 a day �Jeez. Motel 6 ain’t even that much a night.They give us $25-50 a day credit (depending on county) to stay in ours.  BEST DETOX IN THE COUNTRYWhaaaat. I wasn never charged money for jail. I was indigent for getting my wisdom teeth removed before my end of 7 months. Still no bill after. In Texas.You may  be thinking of prison when you think of all the wonderful "benefits" of jail lol. County jail has the utmost, bare minimum, save-you-on-death's doorstep medical care possible. In fact, there are many cases of people dying in county jail for very preventable reasons only because their numerous cries for help were straight up **ignored**.  In less extreme cases, it is still medical care that barely cuts it. Have anything wrong with your teeth at all? It's getting pulled. Do you wear glasses? Did you bring those glasses with you to jail? You aren't getting them for at least a month. Oh you're blind? that sucks. Do you take any medication that isn't directly going to kill you if you don't have it? (diabetics and insulin) You aren't getting it until you see the resident doctor or psych. Guess how long that takes? Yep at the VERY least a month. Took me 2 months to get MY anti-depressants that were already prescribed and I'd already been taking.

Free meals? I will tell you right now that the free meals are something that you wouldn't eat on the outside even if you were hungry. I've met people who were homeless that directly came to jail that wouldn't eat some of the trays. That means last week these people didn't know where their next meal was coming from and they still didn't want to eat the trays. The county jail gets creative in finding ways to fill 2000 calories a day in the cheapest way possible.

Plus, do you know how expensive jail already is? It cost me $4 for a 15 minute phone call and that's on the low end. Many counties in the US have $8-$15 rates for a 15 minute phone call. Before you start doing mental gymnastics to justify this somehow many counties have been sued (successfully) for these obviously exorbitant rates because it is fucking extortion.

All the food on commissary is twice as expensive as it should be, you need to buy any comfort medication you need (advil, tums, pepto). The tablets they give you? It's another huge money grab. I don't even need to get into the prices.

You're argument is flawed in a lot of ways. Why do you think money that inmates are forced to pay to a county jail would ever go to helping veterans or the elderly? Why do you think in  such a corrupt, terrible system that money would go to anything other than making that jail and everyone involved with all of it's backroom deals wealthier? Why do you think the programs already in place for veterans and the elderly don't suffice.

If you do opiates you are LUCKY that you haven't been to jail. If you haven't quit for good don't think it can't happen to you. The cops ARE NOT your friends. The politicians ARE NOT your friends. The system IS NOT your friend. Don't **EVER** get it confused.

Edit: I see you're part of the methadone program. A quick google search shows you have [similar odds of incarceration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667939) as any other addict. Even if you are living completely clean the cops in my town wait outside the methadone clinics and in surrounding parking lots and pull over anyone leaving within 30 minutes of them walking out the door and charge them with DUIs. Drug DUIs in my state carry a mandatory minimum jail sentence in my state. Don't ever get too comfortable.Inmate's don't choose to be there getting a free ride though, you are forced to be there. Prisoner.this might have a hint of truth if everyone one this thread hadn't gone to jail for a drug related incident. Keep in mind that jail is the government locking you in a cage, sometimes for good reasons but often for bad. Using a substance they don't deem acceptable is not a good reason to lock a human being in a cage.Yeah. They consider any part of a day as a full day served. So they release you at one minute past. They say it saves breakfast money and the weekenders can go to work on Monday.*utmostUp most lol r/boneappleteaI didn't get it. That's not a funny joke at all. I mean, I absolutely believe you were just talking shit and aren't smacking up your ho, I don't think you're some evil pimp, it just was a bad joke, that didn't read as a joke.Yes I am and you are correct, it's all racketIt truly is completely fucked, the police in the US are in no way here to protect us, the US supreme court has even explicitly said that. The police forces across the US are nothing but cash machines for the government. It is absolutely disgusting. Not to mention theres not a sliver of actual rehabilitation in the prison system, hence why our reincarnation rate is through the goddamn roof.We should start a “save the Americans” initiative. We’ll start with free health care and free prison time for all!Cant do that lol government loans, like student loans or owing for jail time. The government debts arent affected by bankruptcy. They make sure you're totally fucked.My guy, if the prisoners don’t pay for themselves, you pay for them. 

I’m sorry, but if you or I get caught, we should pay our own way through punishment. 

That’s how it’s supposed to work.No, county owned. Only video visits but we got tablets in the cell and we get 4 free a week (60 minutes total) anything more is $3.75 a minute.  They take half your money that gets put on your books and charge you when you leave, but can't stop you from leaving of courseHow’d you get out of it?Which county? I never got charged for staying in jail, I’ve done 9 months total...lol hey don’t speak too soon- ya might be getting a bill in the mail one day �But, nobody forced you to break the law. This lack of accountability is why jails are so crowded now. You can't tell me a law abiding citizen is snatched up and forced into a cell while minding his own business. Preposterous!Agreed.And since I can't find the post calling me a troll, I will leave this here, too. Forgive me for thinking that people should own their faults. Fuck knows, I've done my share of paying for my sins. I guess it's the difference between a grown-up mindset and, well... All that. I still stand by what I said, consider the sources, and move on about my day.*knot"Panties in a knotch" is the best one herePrison isn't rehabilitation, and the gov. Knows that. Even where I live probation is a set up. 

I saw on the tv the other day this guy had editable lollypops and the cop was like each one of these is a felon. And treating the guy like he murdered somebody.

The war on drugs in the states explicitly started to raise funds for the USA government it's actually fucked. And Trump doesn't make it better> the police in the US are in no way here to protect us

thats honestly a pretty ridiculous statement. Just because you're mad about getting busted when you break laws doesn't mean they don't protect people. I can link thousands of examples of police stepping into the line of fire to protect the citizens.MY GUY (lol) how do you type this out 10 minutes after sharing your sob story about your job prospects being ruined by pot possession?

My guys, I invite all to inspect the post history of [-Dubwise-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Dubwise-/) and marvel at the stark hypocrisy and douchey catchphrases, my guy.  

&#x200B;

TTFN my guys.Where i went to (denmark) i got paid for being there, not worth it at all but nice to get a lil something. It was about 2700dkk for a month, excluding snacks and cigarettes on fridaysOur county jail had tablets too but I was surprised to find out that it was privately owned. I thought it was owned by the state.You're a lucky duck.

Here in a specific county in the South part of Florida, you get two kiosks on the wall for the video calls, not tablets in the cells. Your people can go to a single location in the (quite large) county and do it free, or pay $6ish and do it on their own phone/computer. You get 30 minutes. No such thing as free communication. I think they might give you 1 or 2 stamped postcards in the indigency kit, but I am not even sure about that.Never responded to the bill they sent me and haven't heard from the since, that was about 10 years ago now.Nahhh im 3+ years past the last oneAny law that doesn’t have a victim is not a crime that should be punishable by jail - my .08 dui for an out taillight (and blow in system from previous night) after having possessions of marijuana charges previously shouldn’t be enough to send me away for 30 days or more and then forced rehab. 

It’s BS.No, but many ppl spend time in jail that they don't deserve. We pay fines and or restitution, why the fuck would we have to pay a jail bill on top of it allobvious trollDon't kid yourself. 

Unless you get all of your pills prescribed to you and do not use any other drugs, you've committed a crime punishable by jail or even prison time.

Just because you've never been caught (yet, unless you're clean/100% prescribed and stay that way) doesn't mean you're any better than someone who got caught using.

Personally, my record is 100% small time drug possession unless you count a single silly incident that got dismissed.loool editableWhile some may certainly do that, [they are not required to](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html)There is a stark difference between those two statements. 

You are comparing apples to oranges. 

I was arrested for possession, I completed my probation, which included weekly scheduled urinalysis that I personally paid for. I also paid two different fines and paid for lawyers. 

In total my restitutions were approximately $10,000. But I paid it myself. 

It costs over $30,000 to house an inmate in state prison for one year. If the inmate doesn’t pay for it, the tax payer does. Why should I pay for your incarceration?

As a society We tell offenders that they will be seen as whole after they pay their debt to society. But it’s not true. I paid for myself when I got caught, didn’t expect anyone else to pay for me. 

I complained in that post because I signed a contract with the state when I plead guilty. I kept my end, I paid my debt. The state didn’t keep their end, my possession charge is still haunting me 20 years later. 

You can have a criminal history, and still want the system to work. I’m not anti-law, I’m pro-reform.

Edit: expecting other people to pay for your fuckups is snitch mentality. You know the game has risks when you choose to play it. If you get caught YOU take your lumps and move on. You don’t get to put it off on someone else.What a crock of shit! Haha. They're probably like eh let's just send one and see what happens. 

You a Modest Mouse fan? Username has me wondering.I agree with you, but I dont necessarily agree that a dui doesn't have victimsthat sucks dude, I can't even imagine.I'm not necessarily saying you should. I'm just saying I shouldn't. I'm not saying it's right for jails to charge inmates to be there. I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying, I would rather see the inmate be charged than someone who had nothing to do with his or her incarceration at all. The government sucks. Shit, maybe they should use all of that confiscated drug money and seized property to support the inmates, rather than expecting the money to come from people who don't have it.Lol I can't spell and auto correct fucks me up all day. �That's one way to think about it.  It still seems pretty hypocritical though. 

"Snitch mentality" lol.  The only one snitching is you on yourself.  Maybe it's not some perfect system of everyone owning their shit and accounting for themselves, but you gotta be smarter working within the confines of the system that exists.  Likely, neither of your cases would have ended with a conviction had you not pleaded guilty.

On the 50mg I'd take 4 pills at 10 followed by 4 more at 3 so 400mg total a day. Since the tamol-xx are SR should I be taken differently like crushing and what time should take to get similar feeling at same time as I'd get on the 50mg?

Thanking in advance. I know tramadol isn't for everyone but works well for me and I know about seizure risks., ups: 2, downs: 0I would not crush those or try to overcome the time release.  As you well know,  it could be dangerous.I want to overcome the SR to make it feel like taking the regular 50mg pills. And I'm asking to try find out any dangers as it may be on more dangerous than taking normallyAgree on this. I'd honestly just pop em. They're 200mg, and where i'm from they are popular. If you really wanna test it, put it in a soda overnight maybe. I know that works for morphine, but not so sure on tramadol. Maybe science girl can help?Breaking the time release will give you waaaay too much and might even cause serious health issues. This particular drug is not one you should be trying to fuck around with.  Take it like you should. Crushing it won't be like taking four 50mg tabs.  When taken as directed it is not more dangerous than taking normal IR 50 mgs.The soda (colas, specifically) only do this because of the phosphoric acid in them. The acid breaks down the poly time release matrices. It would most likely work for the tram, too.Always enjoy a wholesome answer. If you really wanna break the SR (come on now tho, we're on r/opiates/, i'd probs do the same) this would probably be your go-to. Ofcourse in harm reduction eyes just popping them whole would be best, but yeaaah, i get the drill. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: best way to consume Percs?, Content: Got the 10mgs, fairly low tolerance. "Used heroin few days ago, Took kratom today at 6AM, Its 4PM now" Stomach is almost empty, bout to eat some noodles then drink a ginger tea afterwards lol.

TDLR: Anyways, What is the best way to consume those? Im thinking bout crushing them, then eat them with water. or should I snort tho? 

Got weed, but thats it.

Thank you., ups: 2, downs: 0Orally is gonna be your best bet.Chew them and swallow on empty stomach or take tums first. Eating right after or before makes them not as strong. For me atleastChew them & swallow is gonna be the most bang for your buck for sure. Considering you did heroin a couple days ago, I’d go for 3. But 2 will give you some nice effects. It also makes a big difference if your stomachs full or empty. If it’s empty it’s gonna hit you harder & faster. Have a good day man, goodluck!Doing H will most likely make your tolerance very high. 10mg ain't much.So, preface, I'm taking intravenous off the table.

If they're actually oxycodone, eating them (best bioavailability other than intravenous, but obviously don't shoot pills!) or snorting them (I believe it has 80%+ bioavailability this way, but comes on way faster).

if they're presses, what I've heard is to smoke them. I wouldn't think they're pressing 10mg of oxycodone, but the people making them could care less. Next would be snorting, which I would do 1/8 or 1/4 at a time. Be careful if this is the case because hot spots are real (and really shitty!).Smoke them hands down the best wayOhh shitt I just ate, think imma take a little break then take them. Is 20mg a good dose? or should I go for 30mgs? Also do they produce the natural opioids extreme nausea and itchiness? I usually hand that by taking benadryl beforehand?THANKS, I needed this.Yeah I wont take one obviouslyHeard of it, Im not that far thankfully.. I just use occasionally.Ew what!?Yeah I didnt like smoking Heroin itself, how would I like smoking a shit that isn't made to smoke?Not really nausea with the percs unless you take too much. that mainly comes from hydro but they do make you itchy. And it really depends on the person id say wait about 1 1/2 hours after you ate and chew 2. Wait 15-20 mins to see how you feel and go from thereAnytime!lol wish I knewHave u never smoked a m box? it’s the bestPersonal preference I guessawesome thanks. Makes perfect sense and helpedDon’t smoke just pop em lolRather just snort or pop.

Been on and off methadone (mostly on and doing h with it still) for a couple of years too.

Now another blood test for the year at the methadone clinic and now they’re telling me I should really really go to a doctor and do further testing cause it looks like my liver may be starting to fail or I may have some sort of liver disease or even be getting cirrhosis of the liver. I’m really freaking scared. At 26 and having to worry about possibly having a liver disease? Been broke and without a job for a couple of months now so I have no money or health insurance so I can’t afford to go to a doctor or even the medication I would need if, god/satan forbid I actually have something.. it’s just depressing and terrifying.

I hope things work out for you.

As far as your warning: thank you for caring. ❤

Good luck to you.Get checked for Hep CWhile it can be normal for certain liver enzymes to go up and down during drug use and withdrawal, its not enough to prompt serious concern.  You will need to have more extensive blood work and possibly imaging done. 

Do you have the option to get onto medicaid in your state?  Due to the opioid crisis, many more states have been adding insurance options for drug and alcohol treatment for folks who do not have access to it any other way. The reason why I suggest drug/alcohol treatment is, if you are currently in treatment, they have to take you into a clinic or hospital and have you treated for health issues. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: how can i stop myself from becoming violent towards myself when i’m sober? does this happen to anyone else?, Content: when i have my drugs, i am able to live. but every time that i end up without, i go downhill so quickly. drugs are the reason i am alive in the first place. they are what keep me from killing myself. so without them, i end up even more of a suicidal mess. i am dry right now and all i want to do is scream and strangle myself. this happens every time. i can’t be sober, ups: 6, downs: 0I completely understand.

My first 5 talk therapists SUCKED--but I totally lucked-out and finally found one that is actually helpful to, and empathetic towards, me!

I would suggest that you start trying your hand at being a talk therapy client (patient)--it could potentially save your Life.

Also: Try your best to manage your meds so that you don't run out so quickly--I know it's difficult.

Good luck and best wishes to you! :)i have absolutely been in this place. when i used i was fine and all, but when i was sober i would self-harm by burning myself and beating my right thigh until the entire thing was purple and swollen and i’d have bruised hands. it takes time, quite a bit of time, to get used to being super. i’m currently 16 months sober as of today, and i’ve gotta say i’ve never been happier in my entire life. took probably 6 months before i was truly happy, but i gotta say it was 110% worth the workThere are other substances that are better at treating depression. Ketamine, mushrooms, lsd all work wonders for a month or so. DMT will take you out of depression for a couple weeks. You got options. In my case I used to feel like you, but time took my depression/suicidal sobriety down to such a level that I’m neutral sober. Brain chemistry isn’t stable and if you excercise, sleep right, eat right and take substances that help and aren’t harmful you’ll be better off.Yea basically the same for me drugs and my bf are the reasons I can survive/not kms. And when I get mad I also get violent against myself so you are definitely not alone.i’ve been in therapy for what seems like forever. i have recently considered quitting all together because i feel i am just impossible to helpI’d suggest OP starts off with a mushroom/lsd trip once every other week. If OP’s country has legal ketamine treatment I’d definitely suggest doing that, but only if OP doesn’t feel like shrooms or lsd has helped him/her.

The best thing to do is to get professional help from a doctor or psychiatrist.I hear you.

But could a change in therapist help? It certainly did for me. I used to be very angry and frustrated with therapists and the whole idea of therapy--until I met this young therapist: it changed everything.

It's strange how we can stumble along through Life--then, suddenly, something changes everything!

It can be a person or an event.

We just have to be open to it (change).Good add. Doctor should be first stop for sure.

Any tips appreciated, ups: 2, downs: 0Trams would definitely help. Don’t exceed 400mg. You could scoop kratom if you need in a pinch and with that tolerance it could help. Goodluck stay hydrated!Your W/D’s will be mostly mental from that low of dose. I wouldn’t expect anything beyond some diarrhea, possibly insomnia, as far as physical W/D’s. You certainly won’t be physically incapacitated. 

If you have you wait 5 days on the plug, you’ll be 90-100% of the way through withdrawal. Maybe you should consider just staying sober. As tolerance and the habit increase, everything else gets worse and goes downhill.Trams were my go to when I was out of oxy. I’d take 150-200 mg in the morning and be good all day.Benzos only seemed to help with rls for meIve taken a half a 50 before and felt weird as hell like i could feel every heartbeat and all my blood moving  super weird but since then havent felt that so ive always taken low doeses of tramValium will help at night. Get yourself some Imodium to stop the stomach aches and diarrhea. My pharmacy ran out once and I had to wait a week for my medicine and this is what helped me.

Hope youv all had a good weekend. Mine has been pretty solid, shooting speedballs and doing family stuff mainly (not at the same time obviously)

Anyways, my fucking chest hurts big time. I’m noticing more and more that I suffer, the following day after slamming

I can’t quit, I won’t quit. But I want to be there for when my boy is older. I want to be the greatest dad I can be for him. But I just can’t say bye to opiates, even though I want to

So instead of yet again trying and failing, why not just say bye to heroin. I know I can stop injecting. I can stop taking heroin, I don’t even enjoy it that much!!! But I love oxy. Why not just move over to oxy, surely it’s safer, and better than trying and failing to quit??

Iv already made the jump to bupe, I still fail from time to time, admittedly my spaces between failing is getting longer which I’m quite happy about!!

So my question is, has anyone changed their opiate of choice and route of choice, instead of failing when they know the won’t be able to quit fully??

Cheers opi fam 👍🏻, ups: 4, downs: 0I am more concerned about the fact that you said you've been shooting speedballs and your chest is hurting? You need to go to the ER. You could be having a cardiac event! Its happened to me before and luckily,  I had no permanent damage to my heart.Oxy is too damn expensive so I went to methadone. It has worked for me.In this case, it would make more sense to quit the stimulant part (cocaine, I assume?) of the speed ball, than the heroin. Given your chest pains and all...Cocaine is bad for your heart. I'd be worried about the chest pain, my friend. 

Please get it checked out, if not for you, for your son. Get off the stimulant part first.Just hearts to breathe.  Not as in my heart hurts. And it’s stopped now?? Iv just done some blood tests with the docs maybe they’ll pic something up there?? Thanks for the concern mate, I didn’t think really. Stupid of meYeh I get that. I’m on bupe. Doesn’t have the same effect though. I’m not too bothered by price at the moment, but I can see price getting silly the more I takeYeh I agree with that. However heroin itself doesn’t feel that good any more. So why not just quit injecting all together and go back to sniffing pills?? Oxy was my fav before I got taken over by the brown mist!!Yeh thanks I’m agreeing with that, it’s time to knock Iv coke on the head while I still can. Iv had a few tests with the doctors lately thank youHurting to breathe is still an issue that you should have checked out.  If the blood tests are looking for cardiac enzymes, yes, they will find it, but if not, well, there is no telling. The blood tests are specific to the assay that they are using.. they do not randomly test for everything. I do hope you end up with a clean bill of health!Cause oxy is way more expensive (usually) and h is stronger. So if you switched back you probably would have to take a lot.I hear you, man.I don’t know. They are looking for any heart/ blood infections or problems I may have picked up from Iv use that’s all I know?? And it’s come back clear so farPlus oxy is often fent pressed. Dope in my area is almost 100% fent now, so your paying more for the same thing of you fuck with street oxy.Yeh I get that. And that’s the major problem I have at the moment. Maybe a little time off to get the h out of my system fully then go from thereThen they would find troponin if it was elevated.I don’t have to worry about the presses side of it. Most of my stuff is still fent free unless I go looking for it ��Maybe. But even then opiate tolerance lasts for a long time.I have a review tomorrow il ask.

He lived the craziest life but he was honestly a great guy.Lmao, I listen to MGMT when I trip �Omg, I love that � he sounds like one crazy motherfucker!try budos band on psychadelicsHe used to cheek his norcos and stock up so he’d have a bottle of 40, and he’d just go ham on them and drive to the liquor store on his Amigo. Then he’d get drunk and keep popping norcos,. Dude just partied like a rockstar every day lol. He might’ve been80. He had needle marks all up and down his arms and we shared war stories. Then one day I blew a disk in my back and had to fight through the rest of my shift, so he handed me 4 norcos and winked and drove off lol. Dude was a hero.I’ll write it down on my notes rn so I remember for next time (:We had a resident like that at the nursing home I worked at. Bragged about how he was a millionaire from all the drugs he sold back in the day.

Management told us to crush all his meds but a lot of the employees didn’t care how he was taking them. He used to roll around in his wheelchair and ask us if he could have our straws when we were done with our drinks. Sometimes other residents would visit his room to trade their medications. 

He died recently.ive almost exclusively listened to them on LSD and I absolutely love it, so much so that even by my 2nd trip I was going to see them live, which is 1000x more incredible. Then probably saw them live for at least 5 more trips. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Are you able to browse this sub when clean, Content: So I’m back into the clean world on vivitrol and hopefully never looking back.  Just wondering how many of you think this sub is a trigger.  I love reading the threads on here but I’m scared if I keep up with my mental opioid obsession (fentanyl obsession truly)  that I’ll eventually give up my sobriety for that ol familiar sting again.   What’s your thoughts on this ?, ups: 2, downs: 0Got clean w/o meds 6m ago and I still browse. It's like nostalgia and reminds me of the good times.I've been clean for 94 days now. And I'm able to browse this sub no problem. I also literally can't use. My son's a million times more important so relapsing isn't even an option. But yeah I'm completely good. I just like to help people that need the help or have questions.A little (I'm on methadone, but I dont slam H anymore). Its easier now that dope porn got banned.

I dont read every post. I like to read the ones where people talk about the shitty parts of being addicted to this demonic powder. That's what I like to remember.It reminds me of where I don't want to be. I've been on opiates for pain since I was 12. Stopped cold turkey back in July. Best decision I ever made.

I might always crave the feeling, but at least I'm mostly free of it.I browse thru the subs when ever I get a bad craving and it almost takes the edge off. I know I’m not actually taking them but just seeing them makes it more bare able.Given that good, fentanyl-free heroin no longer exists east (and perhaps west) of the Mississippi, yes I can. Not even tempted to relapse on some fent garbage.I unfollowed this sub for at least 6 months after getting sober.

Years later I can browse casually and not get triggered but everyone is different.Dont get too remindedYea I’m on vivitrol so I can’t use unless I make a decision not to get my next shot so I feel somewhat safe and I also like answering questions bc I remember what it was like to have to learn all this stuff back in the dayThat’s so strange.  I love fent so much that I literally would give away H for free if I got some.  But it is kinda annoying / scary when you just pass the fuck out and can’t even enjoy the high so I can see where a lot of ppl wouldn’t like itLol at your usernameI had a bad experience with pressies and since I've been done done. It was good times until then. Went cold Turkey and it sucked ass. But no subs or anything else. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Am I smoking bth right?, Content: I live on the east coast and we only get powder dope, which almost all the time is fentanyl or some shitty opiate RC that makes you feel like crap, so I decided to order a gram of BTH said it was Mexican BTH. Got it today it’s cold so it was hard and black, smelled bit like vinegar and started to get sticky if I would touch it.

I have some experience vaping of foil with various powders. So I know the basics and everything worked for me.

So I vaped it and noticed it took bit longer to start smoking and running than powder, but once it starts melting in runs down the foil pretty fast. I’m getting really big hits and holding it in for about 5 seconds. It really to me taste like shit. 

I’m a little disappointed with the high honestly it took me like 4-5 hits to get a alright nod. And the euphoria is less than I expected.

So is this what BTH is? Or am I missing a step, ups: 1, downs: 0BTH is supposedly not as strong due to the way it is produced but that could just be hearsayi did the same thing as you years ago. im also in the east. bth has that real heroin feel. so if you're high and itchy then yea it should be realI live in the east coast and it’s really really difficult not getting fentanylThat’s what I hear locally as well. But who knows, the bth around here could just be low quality compared to the other types here. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: How many days or hours do you have to wait inbetween uses to NEVER go through withdrawal?, Content: Let's assume 80-140mg oxy per day.

Let's assume you have total control or assume you have a dispenser that you can or you can have someone else set a timer....kind of like a timelock safe

Also, can you for example go 7 days on (80-140mgoxy) 48 hours off and repeat forever, NEVER going through withdrawals.

I guess what I'm asking is, based on the usage I specified, how long until your body becomes physically dependent to whee you're starting to experience fatigue and insomnia. In my opinion, insomnia is the worst symptom of all by a long shot...it's not even close imo, ups: 1, downs: 0It normally takes several weeks to a month of daily or near daily use to become physically dependent, which is a prerequisite for experiencing physical withdrawals upon abrupt cessation or discontinuation. There is no magic answer that I can give you. It’s a process, not a point in time. I can’t say that at you won’t be dependent after 16 days use, but you will be on day 17 for example. 

By way of how long between doses you’ll need to avoid dependence? There’s significant interpersonal variability. The biochemical adaptations that occur with chronic opioid use, while being the same in all users, will occur at a different pace. For example, very mild withdrawal can be precipitated a mere 6 hours after intravenous morphine in non dependent users when an antagonist is administered. Obviously that is in controlled conditions and not applicable to your situation, but I use it to illustrate that there is no one answer for every person. 

Higher doses will cause a more rapid development of tolerance and worse withdrawals, but if I were taking >100mg of oxycodone a day for a week at a time, I’d want to leave at *least* a week (preferably longer) between binges. Even then, you may gradually become dependent. You sure as shit will develop a hell of a tolerance though, regardless. If you propose the 48 hour break thing (that may have simply been an example) you’ll be dependent on no time. That’s I sufficient to protect against the development of tolerance. 

Good luck & Merry Christmas �One thing I can say this will only work if you’ve never ever been physically dependent.  The first time I ever used daily it took a month and half or more to start getting sick.  Nowadays even if I’m sober for years if I relapse I have a 3-4 day window to use with no sickness.  If I use 5 in a row I’m sick.Taking 80-140mg a day isn’t really controlling yourselfI have the perspective of 10 yr experience regarding hydromorphone because i use for this purpose you described. If you use 9mg a day spread out every at least 6 hrs with hydro there is no physical or mental withdrawl and mental withdrawls will begin around 12mg a day but very minor and minor physical WD will start at 18mg a day spread out every 4hrs minimum. These are all 3mg doses that are being spread out and no higher

But ialso think this may be due to me not figuring out this process from already years of bejng in the game and getting sick enough to learn it and by that time my body tolerance would be higher than someone who has never used.

But yes i use hydro this way only and so i know this process intimately. Most ppl dont believe me, but i can use everyday and not get sick at all if i be a good boyOxy is a different ball game and even with the knowledge i have now itd take me at least a year to figure it out perfectly. But i feel like 20mg spread every 12hrs with oxy is getting really close to having no physical withdrawl. To be safe 10mg every 8 hrs would probably work @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Loperamide and suboxone.

Ingredients 

Paracetamol 250 mg 
Propyphenazone 210 mg
Caffeine 50 mg
Codeine phosphate sesquihydrate 10 mg, ups: 1, downs: 0Alright, as far as Caffeine is concerned it is moderately soluble in water, not so much in ice cold water and more so in warm water. Propyphenazone is tricky, I can’t find any information on its chemical properties that I’d trust, but its parent compound, Phenazone is soluble at 40mg/ml of 30c h20. 

Once again, like Caffeine, using ice cold water would be beneficial. Phenazone itself has a range of health concerns which is why it isn’t seen in most developed countries. I don’t see why Propyphenazone would be any safer. Even if it isn’t, data is so bare I wouldn’t risk it.

Using ice cold water will decrease the amount of desired product, but the Propyphenazone and Caffeine aren’t good for you, and reduce the subjective high you’ll experience, respectively.

All in all, I wouldn’t bother with these tablets. The amount of Codeine is generous so if you have a low tolerance and can achieve a buzz from 100mg or so of Codeine id say just eat 2. If not, don’t bother.

EDIT: I misread the OP, but just noticed you said 10mg of Codeine?! Fuck those pills.

The film features four families whose lives have been  impacted and forever changed by addiction, and includes stories from  those currently using, people in recovery, as well as perspectives from  law enforcement, health care workers, judges, prosecutors, and others  who deal with people in this crisis every day. Ultimately, the film  gives hope for the user and for the families who’ve been impacted. If  you want a better understanding of addiction and its consequences, watch  this film.

Maryland film maker, Conrad Weaver is excited about the opportunity  to make it available to general public : “I made this film for people  like me. People who think the opioid crisis is ‘Not my problem’. This  was my attitude prior to working on the film; but that’s changed, and my  goal is to help everyone understand that the opioid crisis is ‘my  problem’, it’s ‘our problem’ and we all have a responsibility to help  solve it. I hope people will watch this film and choose to become the  solution.” 

A number of nationally-recognized leaders in the addiction and  recovery community have endorsed the film. John Shinholser, President of  the McShinn Foundation says the film is, “The best current film about  opiate addiction and the family/community impact”.  Ryan Hampton,  national advocate & author of “American Fix: Inside the Opioid  Addiction Crisis—and How to End It says, “The opioid crisis has impacted  nearly every sector of our society and its far-reaching effects are  devastating to individuals, families, and communities. Heroin's Grip  does a great job of helping the viewer better understand addiction and  its consequences, and it shows that recovery is possible when a  community comes together to reduce stigma and provide resources for  those caught in addiction's grip."

I have subs but i read horror stories about fent analogues and pwd so im scared to even attempt it. Any info is appreciated, ups: 1, downs: 0When it came to fent, I've never been able to do it with subs. Just methadone. But what I can tell you is wait as long as you can. And when you think you can't go any longer? Try another hour or two. I got PWDs 40 hours after my last shot of fent.�And I started feeling like shit hours and hours before that.

But you know the world of hurt you'll be in if you don't wait long enough. Being sick sucks but when PWDs happens, death sounds like the better option lol
.I've been thru it a few times, message meyes. the first 2-3 days might be rough since suboxone won't even make you feel well if you have a decent tolerance. so i recommend getting your hands on some benzos or lots of gabapentin. it'll make it easier during stabilizationI'd recommend methadone if you can get it.You can def get methadone off the street.....many clinics where people will sell their shit...you know where if you from the state east of the walt Whitman....How much methadone do u think it would take to hold of wd. Was only using .2 at most a day for like 2.5 monthsI think starting off with 50mg would be a good start... that may work but if you needed more I'd say 70mg would def be enough...I've done everything and methadone will def help ease your withdrawl but don't stay on long term...literally took some liquid methadone and a zanny( don't recommend) but was high for 3 days....without even redosing....so it all depends on your body... @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Buprenorphine patches - what time expect?, Content: Hello,
I am currently on Oxycodone 10mg every 6 hours for a chronic pain condition. I started seeing a new pain management doctor last week and he gave me Buprenorphine 7-day patches to start taking. I have zero experience with this medication and I thought it was for opiate withdrawals? Any insight? I’ve read a bit and it seems people start using these for withdrawal. I’m concerned how the patches will effect the Oxycodone I take. I do have to sometimes take 15-20mg for adequate pain relief. I was on Dilaudid and he switched me to Oxycodone last week.

Any insight? Thank you!, ups: 1, downs: 0Horrible doctorDont take bupre when your on oxy, you will have a fast withdrawal, you must stop 2/3 Days oxy before to take bupre to avoid these effect.I am fucking amazed he didn’t tell you that you’ll start withdrawing immediately if you put on a patch too soon...You cannot mix the two. It’ll get you very sick.I’m confused I’m on subs but I thought only the naloxone is what made PWDsJesus this bloke needs to head back to medical school. The Bupe will probably help your pain just as good as Oxycodone does, so thats a plus. But you need to induce the Bupe correctly. Abstain from the Oxycodone for 36 hours (atleast, to be safe) and then begin the Bupe treatment.

I’d ask him what the go is when you next visit PM. This is pretty reckless but everyone makes mistakes.This doctor couldn’t be more wrong. Taking these two at the same time like he is suggesting will literally have you living in precipitated withdrawal. Which is incredibly painful. Don’t put the bupe patch on while you’re on oxy.Dilaudid is stronger than oxy. Check the morphine dose equivalent chart to see if he lowered your dose. Just so you're prepared if you start feeling a little sick.There was zero talk about taking me off of the Oxycodone... he gave me an entire month’s script for the Oxycodone and zero talk or taking me off of it. He said the Buprenorphine was just another medicine for pain.I have read that as well. Why would he prescribe me both if they’ll make me sick together?I’ll be honest, I have zero experience with Subs or Buprenorphine or withdrawals... my body is definitely dependent on the Oxycodone I take every day but it is prescribed to me and I don’t abuse it. I’ve also never really experienced terrible withdrawals. I’m shocked the doctor would rx this to me tbh.Is this him like trying to catch me as a drug abuser or something? It was my first time seeing this Pain Management Doctor - I’ve never been to a pain management doctor in my life, and my meds have always been prescribed by the same gynecologist and surgeon. I even brought with me all of the meds I was currently on, and have been on. I can’t believe I was dumb enough to not even ask questions about a brand new medication. I had heard the name before so I was like ah I’ll just ask the pharmacist or google when I get home. How dumb am I. Now I’m afraid if I refuse to take it (because I don’t want to go through withdrawals), he’ll get mad that I think I know better than the doctor does. But I’m not going to take it I’d it’s going to make me go through hellish withdrawals - no thank you. 

Unfortunately this pain management clinic had so, so many negative reviews and I just chalked it up to (unfortunately, and I feel like an asshole for this) pain med seekers who were cut off. I probably should’ve listened to the reviews I guess.Oh myyyy goodddddd my mind is so blown idk what to even say like..... :((( you should ask him what the actual fuck.. bupe can be used for pain with someone who has no opiate tolerance. Bupe will just try to replace the opiates to make your receptors think they’re being stroked.Some doctors unfortunately are quite unaware on PWDs.I honestly think that you’ll find Bupe works better for your pain then 10mg of Oxycodone 6h.  That’s something you’ll have to test for yourself however. 

Mistakes happen, even for doctors. I wouldn’t think too much about it, no point in creating a conspiracy. 

Unfortunately the sad truth of Bupe is you will need to withdraw to begin the regime. 40mg of Oxycodone per day isn’t likely to result in crippling, soul destroying withdrawals. Give it a go, it won’t hurt you in the long term. Your pain will be an ongoing battle for years to come if it truly is chronic. This short term suffering may help future you.Maybe I should call and ask why he wants me to take these two medications together. Everything I’ve read online says you should not take these together...Yeah, you will 100% get sick if you take them both together. It’ll send you into precipitated withdrawals.I don’t even know what that means but it doesn’t sound fun.It’s opioid withdrawal on steroids. You do not want to mess with that. Say you didn’t like the patches next time you go. Man I’m happy Reddit is around for shit like this. Crazy that this is possible.I am so glad I posted here before just trying it. I guess I should’ve asked more questions at the appointment but I assumed he knew what he was doing. I actually called and left a voicemail on the nurse line saying that the pharmacist told me I couldn’t take the Oxycodone and Buprenorphine together and asked for a call back.

But, shit. Living completely alone when being addicted to opiates, H in particular, and spiraling deeper and deeper into a dysphoric and meaningless abyss.. it's hard and miserable to endure, and feels extra meaningless when alone.

You have to switch something up, albeit, find a bitch to use with or get sober and go an entire different direction with your life. 

Isolation is a slippery slope.add something new to your routine daily, or maybe weekly if daily is too much. pick up a new hobby. learn an instrument, take an athletic class (kickboxing, yoga, etc), pick up reading, play video games online with people. find things to improve your quality of life. there’s so much to do every day, there’s so much out there. one thing i learned while i was single is i don’t need another human to experience life. i ate alone, i went to the movies alone, i took walks with myself. i really improved my relationship with me before i found someone i was ready to settle down with. 

getting clean is also something that will improve your quality of life, maybe not right away, but if you do it and stick with it you’ll thank yourself. that’s not going to happen till you’re well and ready, but it’s definitely an option. 

like someone here said, doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. switch it up, add a little change in your life.Man this is relatable as fuck. My day currently consists of just nodding out until I have to work. Half the time I don’t even bother watching Netflix or playing the ps4. I just fuck around on my phone in silence nodding off then coming to covered in drool. Repeat until I have to get ready for work. Life is hella lonely currently.Unfortunately when I’ve been using I’ve either done one of two things...got my spouse addicted bc they wanted to see what this stuff was like that I cared about more than anything else in the world, or the others left bc they didn’t want a life with an addict.  It sucks.  If you’re longing for a partner I would highly suggest getting clean first so you can have more to offer.  This addiction crushes those who care about you.My bitch blew up my entire life for drinking so badly I don't want to do anything for the holidays anymore.  

Using anything in a relationship is a time bomb.  Every day I wish more and more that I never married her to begin with.And finding a bitch to use with isn't a slippery slope lol horrible advice cowboy.This is exactly how I am when I’m actively usingBuddy sounds like he's about to Cobain himself. Sucking on a tiddy ain't the worst thing.

Also, saying girls are a "slippery slope" and calling random men on the internet "Cowboy". I think I see what you're getting at, Lance.It’s honestly kinda funny because I have an abundance of dope, my own place, I’m financially stable to a degree. I would think I have everything I could ever want. Yet I’m miserable as fuck still... I just numb myself into unconsciousness so I don’t have to think about the crippling loneliness @@@@@@@@@@ Title: How can I use a credit card number to get cash, Content: I dont have the actual card but theres gotta be a way, ups: 2, downs: 0Western UnionYou can WesternUnion to yourself. Or use Moneygram, RIA, WorldRemit @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Saving money, retiring early and enjoying heroin all day?, Content: I have this loose but very enticing life plan. I am currently a medical student I will graduate in 2 years and be making shit tons of money for the rest of my life. I’ve figured by age 30 I should on average where I live, be pulling near ~$200k yearly and possibly increase this to 300/400k over that next decade. I have been floating this idea around for years now. Hear me out.

Save big time. Literally live so simply. Save as much as possible. Never marry or have children. Simply date different women all the time. And letting them go should they wish to walk due to no marriage/not wanting kids/anything. I want to live alone in peace. I don’t want children and would get a vesectomy and store some sperm should I ever change my mind. Invest in properties. Until I’m around 45/50. Or whenever it becomes feasible financially. Then literally blow it all on a heroin/travel/culture binge that lasts years. I could travel the world. Play golf. Spend loads of time feeling unfuckingbelievable because the heroin. I’d never have financial issues and I’d have no job so wouldn’t run into a lot of the problems heroin addicts seem to. 
I’d never get sick. I couldn’t run out of money if I planned it accordingly. A serious heroin addiction right now runs about 20-30k a year. I could even afford 40k if I had 1-2million saved up in properties etc. I’d never get dopesick. I’d always have my powder. I’d have no family to look after and I wouldn’t tell anyone about my addiction or I’d try my best to mask it. 

Way I see it, it literally is perfect. I’ve never been that keen on life or living and if it gets impossible I could just kill myself. But imagine a decade or 15 years of pure fucking bliss. Heroin on demand. All tested of course. I’d have a fucking time. And come the time should things change and I don’t want to. So what. I can do other things with my retirement. I realise it is a selfish life but it would be so lovely for so long and even if I forgot it all I would know I spent a lot of it superbly blissful and relatively free of most heroin addicts problems/worries. And should I die prematurely or whatever I wouldn’t care because I’d be dead., ups: 0, downs: 0your missing one facter in your big dream...the average lifespan of a heroin addict.Well, I'll ask an important question for this bunch...what are you specializing in as a doctor? Pain management perhaps?So you will somehow find a magical plug who has unlimited amounts of clean product ? And you plan on traveling with all this ? Lol. So what happens when tolerance builds and you’re going through your stash more and more and then you have to resort to a new source, and you aren’t able to find clean product ?how do you plan on traveling with it? How do you plan on meeting a dealer who will sell only clean product in massive bulk when your 40-50? I’m not trying to knock your dream, but the stars would have to align perfectly for all that to work and even then it’s still iffy lolIt sounds like the perfect purposeless life.Right, careful with that prescription pad Doc.Fent hotspot, r.i.pI can kinda relate.  I’ve always said once I get real old like 65+ I’m just gonna start doing dope again bc fuck it.  Might as well die happyUnpopular opinion? I love it, lol. Who knows which way things will go? There is al ot to discover. Do NOT start earlier.Here’s what will really happen. You will realize it will take longer to ramp up to the income your Greys anatomy fantasy led you to believe (don’t doctors make crap for like 7 years while they do residency or whatever?) You will start the heroin habit early “cuz why not? I can handle it, I’ve seen plenty of movies.”, lose all your money and your job and if you are even alive at 30, move back in with your mom after she’s kicked you out for the second time.This is actually one of my day dreams I have every so often, well this and somehow taking all the fun stuff from a pharmacy lol. But yeah your plan is nice in theory, it would be great to have no real responsibility and a bunch of money, plus being at the age where you could give a shit about health issues or anything, yeah it sounds great. 

Obviously theres some big holes in the plan, some have been pointed out by others but its a fun idea definitely.I mean I guess, but by the time your at the age to start this and you have so much built up you probly won’t wanna waste it on heroin anymore.Exactly. Especially with that much money. If your smart about dosing & with clean dope, a heroin addict can live 15+ years. But many OD long before then. Especially if they have that much money, because you’d be doing a shit ton of dope all the time.Assuming I don’t begin until 45/50. I’d take 10/15 years of bliss then. Dying at 65? so what.No this is good. I need to know the pitfalls. I realise finding a source would be very important. But with enough money and will I’m sure I could find a good source to buy a serious amount from. For purity purposes then I’d just test the batch completely first. Like that’s the thing I wouldn’t need a constant guy on the go. I could buy very large quantities. month’s worth presumably.  and if that avenue didn’t work i’d probably order it online and just leave the package unattended for several weeks so if it was to be claimed i could say it wasn’t mine. I’m really sure it just wouldn’t be an issue if I bought from the equivalent of the dark web in a few decades. I’m sure I’d work out getting the supply easily enough with the right research and precaution. 

The travel would be another problem but I imagine I could definitely work my way around it. How do other heroin addicts manage holidays/travel? Also being 45/50 ex doctor I feel I wouldn’t be considered a junkie etc and could avoid the stigma more easily.I think there ways to solve some of this..Remember, he still has to magically be a doctor for decades. Someone with access to a prescription pad and possibly even a pharmacy (hospital). He either has to not use for a long long time or never get caught.That’s all I want.>If your smart about dosing & with clean dope, a heroin addict can live 15+ years.

CiteI’d value that extra 20 or so years of elderly life over fucking dope. This is it, nothing after this. You need to think about future herbyx17.In a perfect world this would all be realistic, but you’re more likely to be ripped off trying to buy large quantities of stuff and or be set up by law enforcement. I’ll be honest, your life plan sounds well thought out as in what you want for your future and ways to invest etc but you seem naive as to the whole drug thing. Addicts going on vacation are usually just bribing enough to get them through a week or so. You are talking about traveling all the time and therefore increasing the risk. Drug addicts don’t travel constantly, for the most part. With that being said, it’s gonna be much harder at your age and your profession to get into the drug game let alone the amounts your talking. You also mention a constant guy on the go?? So do you expect to find a traveling drug dealer that just so happens to be traveling within reasonable distance of you all the time ? Lol. Sounds like a “pipe” dream tbh lolI for one, will not travel further than from the meeting spot back to my house with my dope, at all whatsoever.

But dope tolerance snowballs and there is literally 0.00001% chance of you finding a source for completely clean and pure dope.

Also also, what's your planned roa? If you snort it you're gonna end up fucking up your sinuses eventually, if you smoke it you'll fuck up your lungs, and if you shoot it eventually you'll fuck up your veins and not be able to hit.

This is not a sustainable plan at all. Are you currently an addict?Exactly! Like I was saying in a previous comment. It seems like more of a pipe dream. Almost like when you buy a lottery ticket and automatically start thinking what you will do if you win lol. The main problem is how he thinks all of this will miraculously just work as planned when all it takes is one thing to not go
As planned and then everything else is effected by it. The main problem being that out of nowhere a 45-50 year old doctor will be able to just acquire a perfect plug that is willing to just start selling large amounts of uncut product and always be on hand when needed, especially when the OP plans on traveling frequently. As he stated earlier. Having a guy that’s on the go.... it’s like what type of dealer like that travels around the word with bulk product on hand ��‍♂️�Keep in minds that it might not always be what you want.  Addiction makes it very hard to get outside of yourself, however, that’s what people usually ultimately want.  Take a look at Maslows’ Hierarchy of Needs, again and see what you might want out of life other than the bottom levels.Simply go to bing and type in “how long does a heroin addict live”, not google because they recently decided to only show treatment centers and shit when searching about drugs. But yeah every website I’ve clicked on says 15-20 years is the average expectancy for a hardcore heroin addict. And that’s if they don’t OD. If they were to use with accurate doses and minimize risks. But of course more often then not, people overdose long before 15 years of daily use.If one where to be using pharmaceutical heroin (or opioids in general) like Diaphin, a opioid addict can live till natural causes take them. Opioids are incredible safe, as far as chronic toxicity is concerned. Its everything else that kills you. Unsterile equipment, overdosing, impure/poison impurities or just getting stabbed or shot over a gram.

The average lifespan of 15 years you see isn’t because of chronic toxicity. 

One thing this guy isn’t thinking about is that tolerance will just go up and up till he is blowing $200k a year on dope. With the means to do so, this can become a reality.But you're talking about clean dope. That's different.Exactly. Especially with that much money, dope will quickly turn into a full time job. He isn’t gonna have time for golf as he says. Or any of that stuff, because the only thing he’s gonna be thinking about is when he can get to the plug next, or when can he get to the bathroom to do a shot etc. with basically what will seem like “endless” money at first, will cause him to use as much as he can whenever he can. Which would cause his tolerance to grow more rapidly than probably any of us have ever seen.Also these days doctors are under scrutiny from government agencies. A friend of mine I met at rehab was a GP and had some issues with this. 

He failed a drug test after someone in his workplace became suspicious he was using. He has now lost his medical license and is required to seek treatment should he ever get it back. 

Money isn’t the only issue with dope. 

I know this is the most obvious statement ever to you and I, but OP seems to be underestimating this.> is required to seek treatment should he ever get it back. 

That is TERRIFYING! Do you know what that means? Here are some links:

I am so fuckn miserable though! I cannot wait to get off probation so I can use again (or at least smoke weed)... I miss partying, I miss eating molly and dancing all night, I miss the warm hug of heroin, I miss getting baked as fuck and geeking until my little heart is content, I miss doing adderall and being productive. Idfk, I feel like I have the right to do so and just being prohibited to do that and the possibility of a lengthy jail sentence if I do infuriates me... I know this is such a sick way of thinking, I know I deserve better. I know I am killing myself and my spirit by using heroin... idk I’m just counting down the days at this point. Heroin, and drugs to some extent, feel like the LOVE of my life and they’re now my ex. But it’s like that ex we’d all like to call up every now and then to fuck, y’know? Good news though is I only have 1 more drug test to take for probation then after that my drug tests are done, let’s hope it’s soon so I can get wrecked 😑 I just miss getting high so badly. 🙌 I have 232 days until I’m off probation, so let’s hope these cravings aren’t as intense or completely go away by then, maybe things will be different when I’m able to smoke weed y’know... also I’m moving to a new city next week with a methadone program so I may just get on maintenance so I don’t fuck up probation. Also, I’m on the spectrum for autism and adhd and tryna find a psychiatrist to help me with meds so cravings might be better when I’m on prescriptions. Who knows? A lot can can change in 232 days. So if you’re reading this get fuckn toasted tonight in my name pls. Someone chase that dragon in the name of dyelyn666. Peace, love and narcan my buds, ups: 23, downs: 0I feel like a hypocrite saying this because I’m literally sitting at home practicing a speech I have to give in favor of decriminalizing drugs...but you’re probably better off this way, at least as far as the heroin goes. I used the feel the same way, like heroin was the love of my life, and I would never want to live without it. When I was clean, I felt like I was missing the thing I loved most. When I was on it, I felt so good. I would have done anything to defend its honor, it was my best friend, my confidante, my reason to live. Well, there’s a difference between love and infatuation. I’m not one to condone our current justice system, I believe that everyone should have the autonomy to do as they wish with their body. But heroin really put me through it...and since it sounds like you feel the same way that I did about it, just keep that in mind when you’re off of probation. If you want to drink or do molly and dance all night, then do you. But if you could go this long without using opiates, maybe it’s for the best. If for no other reason, because  “heroin” has become incredibly dangerous due to fentanyl (which is a byproduct of criminalization as well). There’s no sense in being miserable about something you can’t change. Try to take what you can from your mandatory sober time. Heroin is never as good as you remember it being. Time away form heroin has a tendency to wipe your bad memories, and all you can remember is the good. But for every good moment, endless misery awaits. At least, unlike many people who are using, you won’t be incredibly sick tonight.That's a good amount of clean time your stronger than I.
Blaze one for the homieHey man, I'm writing this on an old account on my old phone I found.  I was in active addiction and really involved with the distribution of xanax back then.  I'm almost 18 months clean. Im not gonna preach man because I use to love heroin and xanax more than anything, shit, I still do..I just can't take being locked up any more.  I love my freedom more now. I love eating real food and not jail trays. I fucking have fun and you can to man. Dont think you are immediately turned into a fucking square because u dont use smack or whatever. Lol I have replaced heroin with pussy tho. Go live bro. I thought I needed xanax and heroin because I was so fucked up and PTSD and anxiety and whatever excuse. Fuck all that shit.  Go fuck bitches and fix your credit.  If u gotta get on maintenance try a low dose of bupe.  Best of luck homie.  Stay outta jail for now!Just DONT DONOT!!!!!! that’s the devil with his hooks in your soul. Focus that energy on something else and don’t be a slave to that shit, please please please just DONT DO IT!!!!. You  are better than that.232 days is a long time but not "secure" for heroin craving. You have to stop with methadone (that's the worst) and stay sober for 1 year or two. I've made like this and I'm off heroin from 10 year (now I'm 33). But you are a junkies, and that's because you have to find other drugs to use sometimes and not so strong like the big H. After 1,5 years of TOTAL SOBRIETY,   I start to use sometimes opium or kratom or coke but NEVER everyday or every weekend. Ones or two time for month, and I found my equilibrium. Good luckI can def relate but I’ve learned (I hope) from my 50 relapses that I just can’t use opiates recreationally.  I can smoke weed, drink, do anything else and put it down and not touch it for months but once I put an opioid in my body it’s game over.Thank you love! Yeah I have this vicious cycle with opiates that we probs all know too well... the being clean then relapsing and remembering how deep and dark and rocky rock bottom actually can be. It’s like we forget when we’re not there, and then immediately regret anything that could’ve brought us back to that dark place. Idk that’s why I’m hoping in the next 232 days something changes and I have another reason to be sober, cause once that probation is up I won’t GIVE A FUUUUUUUCK �I’m really not that strong haha, the only thing keeping me sober is the possibility of jail. If it wasn’t that I’d be higher than a kite rn232 days is a long time for something to change. For me, I didn’t stop thinking about heroin for about a year. It got easier after that. After a year, something clicked. The first year was a constant fight, but after some time it does get easier. Way easier. Now, I only remember the bad. I wouldn’t even dream of putting myself through that again. If someone put it in front of me, I wouldn’t be tempted at all. It just takes time, you will get there. The farther away you get from it, the less it will occupy your mind. Just like a break up really, a super shitty breakup with someone you thought was a soulmate. It takes time. And it’s even harder when you’re on probation and feel like you have no choice. I was the exact same way. As soon as I had to stay away from heroin, all I remembered was the good- the warm and fuzzy feeling, the numbness, the minutes that follow a good shot...but you have to remember the torture that it is too. It sounds like you’re doing everything you should be doing, and it’s just a matter of time before you feel better. I truly wish you all the best!Methadone is a pain in the fucking ass. I originally got on it to comply with pre trial. This was back in April. Within a few days, I was able to stop using. I take 80mg. And it changed my life!

Since then, I have only used one time, one regrettable night. Thanks to methadone, I only felt probably 70% of what I used, and was able to fight the urge to cop the next day. I almost did. I know I would have been back off on a run without it.

My life has changed so much. Eight months ago, I was not even 8 weeks into a relapse. I had just lost another job and was paying to crash on a friends sofa. Then, I got arrested for a couple xanax. The friend kicked me out because I got arrested. I used the last of my money to rent a room, and my gf agreed to pay for my methadone for a few weeks.

Now, my gf is my fiancee. I'm still not amazing at keeping jobs (I'm a shitty server, I guess), but there are a million restaurants and i manage to pay my bills. I have my own (very) little place in the hood and a (crappy) car. My case is still pending, but for the first time in my life my father helped me get a lawyer, so for now I can smoke weed, which helps a lot with anxiety and boredom. I take xanax infrequently (if I really need to sleep), infrequently enough that I pass my clinic drug tests (they dont test for THC) and have two take homes so I only go M-F.

Sorry for the novel! I just wanted to tell you that you should try methadone! Give it an honest shot! I was always MISERABLE before when I quit opiates. Maintenance might be the tool you need to improve your life.

And yes the clinic can be a pain in the ass, and the detox can be tough - extremely tough if you dont taper properly. But for me and many others, the positives outweighed the negatives by a LOT!I'd take it as a blessing man stay clean!Love your username haha, I wish I could take it as a blessing but I’m just a dry drunk but with opiates instead... something’s gotta change with this whole sobriety shebang cause I can’t keep it up much longer �JJ WILL BLESS YOU WITH A FAT BAG AFTER PAROLEhaha I love it to thanks buddy and good luck to youBless you I love you for this! But y’know what’s fuckn crazy!???!!! JJ has been coming through now that I’m sober! Obvs I don’t accept any of it but... I’ve found dope I’ve had hidden for months, on multiple occasions recently, found some stanky stank straight vinegar boi on the sidewalk about a month ago probs like 3 points of that. Plus my best friend has like 200 30mg adderall rn and a really old script of oxy he ain’t finna eat so JJ is around but I have to screen his calls �

(I'm going to be saying "me" in the following rant but by me I also mean to say "addicts" in general. We are by no means all the same so I don't mean to speak for anyone else but if you relate then you relate and so when I say "me" just think of whatever addict you are close to I'm life.)

What people who want to lecture me about using and tell me to stop using don't understand about my situation (and I'm sure it's true for other people too) is that at this point in my life I've already fucked everything up so bad that using drugs is not that big of a deal any more. 

Other than when I'm at my work---which mostly consists of watching tv---I literally do nothing and have nothing to do. I'm too old to think I'm ever going to start a career or family. I have nothing to look forward to and no real attachments in this world. Well, I have my brothers, but at some point I'll just be a burden to them. So much to look forward to! 

So when I sit in my room staring into space thinking I have nothing to look forward to and I don't really matter to anyone and my best days have passed etc etc when I'm sitting there feeling sorry for myself because I haven't had any reason to leave the house or haven't talked to anyone for a couple days, and when the thought of getting dope crosses my mind please don't tell me I fucking shouldn't. I'll decide for myself.

In my mind: Is it worth it? Most likely this means I'll be sick again... But what other consequences will there be? The impact on society? Give me a break.

So next time you get it in your mind to tell an addict that they should stop what they're doing please remember this and just keep your mouth closed. We have already thought plenty about what we are doing---take it from me, it's like all we think about sometimes---and we don't appreciate someone else telling us we need to get clean and that we're going to ruin our lives . You don't know my situation. You don't know anything about my life because if you did you'd know that *I'm already waaaaaaaay passed that.* I'm just waiting for life to be over really. And it hurts. That's what pain relievers are for, right? 

So I don't need your advice, thanks. I've already heard anything you could possibly say, probably a million times. Maybe you have good intentions. Still, save it. Talk shit about me all you want but don't preach to me that I should do this or that, don't tell me there is a path to recovery or any of that crap. I know what there is. I also know where I'm at. There is no getting better, there is just surviving, trying to get through the days without using... Or using. *Shrug* Some days it's just what I need to make myself feel better and to get me out of bed. 

One more time: please, don't tell an addict to get off their ass and get clean. Just keep your advice to yourself. We know what we should do but sometimes we don't want to and it's not your business to stick your nose into. Sorry if you don't like that, but it's just not. I don't tell you what to do and you don't tell me what to do. Mutual respect. And if you give me less respect than you afford most humans just because I use heroin then that's on you. It's just another kind of bigotry.

I (like you) am just doing the best I can to get by. Maybe we have different ways of doing that. Maybe you don't like my way. Sorry... Not sorry. This is who I am. If I'm not hurting anyone but myself then kindly leave me to do that in peace. Believe me, an addict who looks serene and chill on the outside can be hiding a giant storm inside.

And finally for my fellow addicts out there (really that's everyone, but you know who I mean) Good luck. That's what we need. Because using is like playing the slot machines. We put money in but it doesn't come back out and there's no way we can possibly come out on top. It's a gamble. But lots of things in life are. Good luck keeping control. If that's what you want. Good luck with everything. We are like each other and maybe you can at least get a little strength from that? Stay cool y'all. Much inspiration to everyone.

**Tl;dr:** To people who want to tell me to stop using... Ummm Did you think I never thought of that for myself?, ups: 7, downs: 0>I'm too old to think I'm ever going to start a career or family.

unless u r like 60+ this just isnt trueI may be an addict, but I certainly am not anything like this, nor do I want to be lumped in with such a groupYou can keep using and that's your choice, but dont act like you couldnt get your life together. You definitely could, you just dont want to put in the effort, and that's fair enough.SadYou don't want advice? Nah you don't want to hear and face the truth. All addicts are different but your hopeless and that has zero to do with addiction.... You sound mentally ill with this bullshit rant. Get help dude your never too old just an addicts excuse to justify using.Weak.Or unless I'm a long-term drug addictExactly. Addicts have hope and dreams. Huge difference.You don't know shitLifeYou don't know much about life. Particularly about mine. You also forget that you don't know my age or medical condition. And that's among other things. You simply have the perspective of someone who hasn't seen much of life yet. 

As far as "advice" goes, there is absolutely nothing you or anyone else could say to me that would make any difference to anything or that I haven't heard many times before, so get over yourself.Like it said above... Do you think I've never had the thought myself?

Anyway, what's really weak is *you* taking cheap shots at someone revealing their troubles. Nothing better to do? Sounds like you have just as little life as me.Ok. You define success. You might not be able to accomplish whatever dream you once had, but you can still have a fulfilling life. You could get a job, a girl/guy, have a nice place, and all that jazz. You could eat right, meditate, and actually find some peace but it's a lot of hard work and I understand why you'd choose to just feel sorry for yourself, do drugs, and be a little bitch on reddit. Doesn't make a difference to me, only to you.unless you're dead, its never too late. I was in rehab with a 78 year old man. I don't think he was judging you. It's just usually true that most addicts don't want to put in the work it takes to get sober. Even when I was loving sobriety, I still relapsed. Would I rather have stayed sober? Yes, 100%. But while I was sober, i just got tired of it.Could I stay clean? Yes. Could I make my life a successful one? No longer possible. Things have happened. I don't feel like going into too many details but there's no turning this shit around now.

Let me just give you one example: my grandpa is a millionaire but he left all his money to my two little brothers because my credit is so bad if he would have left anything to me it would have just been taken away. So my little brothers have their own business and all this shit. But it's too late for me. I also have pretty big medical problems as a result of my long term use. There is more too but believe me, *I know more about my own situation than you do.*I didn't say I knew ANYTHING about your life, I just said that it's never too late to get your life together unless you're dead.That's nothing more than a naive platitude. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: How the fuck do I stop the itching from withdrawls, Content: Been fucking around with small amounts of fentanyl transdermal patches but just ran out and won't get anymore for a week or two.

I literally took a muscle relaxer and also 8 or so melatonin PMs...still tossed and turned all nightHydrocortisone cream from the store.Ill try some more today I did take some last night though. Thank you

Edit: merry Christmas too ��If what you were doing was anything other than Methadone or Buprenorphine, it might be just about over, physically at least. Getting off most pharms or H was 3 or 4 days average for me and most people I knew. I've been mostly "clean" for nearly 10 years so I don't know If the newer pills are much different, but I would be surprised if they were. So you might want to give it another day before you set yourself back by using even a little.


Benzo's (Xanax or Valium) was the best for me and other people I've read about. The tapering off was the worst way for me because I couldn't stop just doing them all but if you have the will power go for it.

If you do try the benzo route be careful because W/D's off those were worse than the tar and OC's I was doing.Thank you I'll go buy some give it a crackWell I unfortunately have already dosed but I’m going to only try and dose at night as to actually go to sleepApply it to particularly the scratchiest areas.Will do thank you very much @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Nasal oxy vs opana, Content: Can someone tell me what would be an oxy equivalent to opana? I have the chance to get some ir opanas but idk how much to get. I only use nasal btw, ups: 1, downs: 0You should learn how to use equianalgesic charts.  I've explained how to use them here: [http://northwesttennesseeharmreduction.home.blog/2019/11/26/using-opioid-equianalgesic-charts-to-determine-equivalent-doses-of-different-kinds-of-opioids/](http://northwesttennesseeharmreduction.home.blog/2019/11/26/using-opioid-equianalgesic-charts-to-determine-equivalent-doses-of-different-kinds-of-opioids/)

I'll do the work for you anyway...

1.5 oral oxycodone = between 3-7 oral oxymorphone. 

According to the chart I've linked above, which is also available on this subreddit's sidebar, you'll find that the bioavailability of oral/intranasal oxymorphone is 15%/43%.  For oral/intranasal oxycodone, it's 87%/50%.

Divide the right side of this equation by 43/15... now we've got between 1.046 and 2.44 mg IN MO.   

Divide the left side by 50/87... now we've got 2.61 mg IN CO. 

Hooray, your answer is...  ***about 2.61 mg of intranasal oxycodone is equal to anywhere between 1.046 and 2.44 mg intranasal oxymorphone.***

*In my experience, you can expect Opana to be anywhere from twice to 2.5 times stronger than oxycodone.*

**Why is there a range of answers?** 

Everybody processes these drugs differently.  Visit Wikipedia's "Equianalgesic" page to see the ranges for yourself if you're interested in checking my calculations. 

**Here's what you should take away from this**

Opana is really strong.  You should take 2.5 times less oxymorphone than you would oxycodone in this situation, AT MINIMUM.  I suggest starting off with about 5 times less oxymorphone than you would oxycodone, partly because it's that strong, and partly because we're all different. 

**Why you can't use web-based equianalgesic calculators**

These tools are good for general equivalencies, but not when you use opioids NOT as they're prescribed.  Doctors don't prescribe these drugs to be used intranasally and, therefore, these tools you might find on the interwebs won't provide you with an accurate calculation for intranasal use.To me 5mg of opana feels like about 40 mg oxycodone. Lasts longer too high is different though, opana has more of a heroin type feel to it and is more nods imo opana>oxy and that goes for both snorted and iv alike @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Cold copping?, Content: How do you cold cop in an area that isn’t very opiate friendly?

( done before many times) same old come down, the shits , sweats, cant eat, cant stay asleep. But just so everything is out there... in that 2.5 days i took half of a 30 mg adderall 1 day ago and the other half following day.

I'm astonished! Clinic got Sublocade (Buprenorphin Extended Release), Content: Finally! They got it! Sublocade. It's extended release Buprenorphin without the Naloxone (Naloxone makes me feel really bad, and clinic couldn't give me Subutex and not Suboxone.  


But now I can taper out of opiates with Sublocade. I need to get a dose subcutaneous i think, every 14th day. This tells me that this will be the most pleasent way to taper and detox from Suboxone? I remember tapering last time, I woke up and felt shit untill the Suboxone worked. Now there's a stable blood values and no small withdrawals before I dose every morning.

&#x200B;

Am I right? And can you recommend a tapering plan? It's every 14th day. I'm currently taking 60mg Methadone. That converted into Buprenorphin would be how much (I really don't want too much)? I hope someone can calculate this for me as my clinic really wants it to take too much time compared to US methods.  


This is a picture of Sublocade:

&#x200B;

I'm so happy because my logic tells me that this is THE TAPERING substance to use to feel the least unpleasent withdrawals. So please tell me I am right :-D Ofcourse only if I am.  


And how should i go from Methadone to Sublocade? How many hours after last Methadone dose should i begin Buprenorphin?, ups: 4, downs: 0Your dose of methadone will be titrated downwards. 

From a reduced dose of around 20-30mg or so, you will  go cold turkey. When you are in moderately severe withdrawal (greater than 12 on the COWS) you’ll be inducted on buprenorphine in the vicinity of 2mg. After a couple of hours, they’ll chuck you an extra 4-8mg of buprenorphine every 6 hours until withdrawal is alleviated. 

The dose will be adjusted after a day or two of close collaboration with your prescriber. 

Once you are stable on sublingual buprenorphine for at least a week (likely 14 days) you can receive the Sublocade depot injection. This process will be coordinated with your physician. It’s not something you’re going to do alone. You’ll be supported along the way. 

Oh the normal dose is 300mg once a month. You can dose 2 days early or up to 14 days late, without worry. 14 days dosing interval seems odd? Once you’re stable on the 300mg a month, you can go down to the 100mg and drop off from there. Or so the theory goes. 

Congratulations and hopefully it all works out for you :)

Merry Christmas �Ive seen that advertised and I am interested as well. Subs never have helped me very much. I currently go to the methadone clinic. I eventually want to taper off. And then at least for a while Im figuring on either getting on either Vivitrol or SublocadeI'd be nervous AF making that switch.  You will be in some sort of discomfort if you want to make the switch without bupe throwing you in withdrawal.  Methadone to bupe is a hard transition.  I wish you luck and hope it works out for you.Thank you sir and merry christmas to you! Can I ask you if I'm right about my theory? That this extended release solution will make the tapering much easier and with a lot less pain?When I am using either of Methadone and Buprenorphin, I still wake up feeling withdrawal groggy. Also in Bupe even though the half life is long. I can feel the need for the dose. Some people can administer both Methadone and bupe every single day. Some every third day on bupeI am so toxic in the morning I tell youYou’re going to be in a shitload of discomfort when you cold turkey methadone and induct on buprenorphine, believe me on that. 

But regardless, no not really. The sublocade depot is simply more convenient for some people and minimises the inconvenience of daily supervised dosing and increases compliance. 

It’s going to make zero difference whether you have a depot injection of buprenorphine or whether you take the equivalent dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual film. I mean, you’ll be on sublingual films for a week or two before receiving the shot anyway. Or at least you would be in the jurisdiction I reside in. 

Tapering buprenorphine is tapering buprenorphine. Whether it’s a depot subcutaneous injection or strips. The films actually allow you to taper more gradually with more granularity and the opportunity to fine tune things. 

You seem to be really keen on the Sublocade and I really hope it works out for you. But I’m not sure that I share your optimism that it’s some panacea over regular Suboxone or Subutex. It has its pros and cons. But then so do sublingual films or tablets. 

You have to weigh up whether in your unique circumstances, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Only you can decide if it’s right for you. It may be, it may not. 

Have a good one :)You seem to have a lot of knowledge. I am prescribed Clonazepam for GAD and I got Zopiclone and Nitrazepam for sleep. I can cold turkey benzodiazepines without discomfort. Just need strong sedating anti histamine for a few days to sleep after quitting benzos.

So your post made me ponder about quitting cold turkey.

But I need some knowledge on preferred Clonidine dose for withdrawals? Last time I detoxed I ate them 25mcg like candy.
Helped with hot flushes, anxiety, gastrointestinal problems and other things.

You got knowledge of dose? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy street prices in Australia?, Content: Checked streerrx site and reported prices for Endone 5mg range from $5-$50 per pill with average prices around 20-25 bucks, guessing these prices are in local currency,  about 15USD average per 5mg tablet

My last use was last night around 6pm of oxys took about 140mgs in a span of a couple hours.... My plan was to fight through the day and get to 6pm the next day so it would be 24hrs to start taking subs. But at work I was WDing and found 2 pills (u36) which is "Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate"... It didnt help much, im still in slight WD and is getting worse and worse. I have subs, but do i really need to take them tomorrow morning (24hrs) or do you think I will be fine taking a 16th of a strip to help?? Any suggestions????, ups: 1, downs: 0I wish I could help but Suboxone is super finnicky for me when it comes to pwd. I've waited two days from last oxy use and still got super sick. Look up Suboxone COWS score and try your hand at that. That's what doctors go by in order to induce you.It's so not worth the risk taking that bupe yet!  I'd be sure I was withdrawing pretty hard before taking any.The thing with Suboxone and precipitated withdrawal’s is usually happens because people take too much Suboxone and it kicks off all the remaining opiates for from the receptors. If you start off taking .5 of a milligram and gradually introduce it into your system it shouldn’t be a problem. I’ve done it this way after only eight hours of doing a full opiate. It’s when people try to take 2 mg or a half a strip That they run into the real problems. But I would say take a half of a milligram or like you said one 16th of a strip after that wait an hour and see how you feel and take another 16th I will strip and go from there as long as your gradually introducing it like I said you shouldn’t have a problem @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Patiently waiting, Content: Just ranting really.

I want my life back., Content: Long story short I've been using for 6 months now. I graduated from dope to fent m30s. I use up to 10 a day. I have destroyed my finances and now am risking my job and relationship.  I'm done.  I've tried and failed to quit several times and always pussy out and call my dealer on day 2 of wd. Tears in my eyes. Depression in full force. Thoughts of suicide (I wont do it. No worries here)
Hot cold hot cold hot cold. Gotta piss but I'll hold it for hours so I dont have to walk to what feels like Antarctica to go use the toilet.  

Enough of my bitching. I'm quitting starting tomorrow. I know wds are different for everyone but what timeframe am I looking at here. I know it can last up to weeks and feelings are subjective but my plan is to work tomorrow and take my last dose in the morning. I'll get through the day and start feeling tingly probably by the time I clock out. Yall know that feeling. Terrible anxiety...body starts to ask you "what the fuck man" and the pain starts.  I will then have Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off of work. Is it reasonable to think by friday I'll be at least functional enough to go to work again ? I literally cannot take any more time off of work. I WILL do this. I am going to be as strong as I can and I have my wife backing me up. I made her take my keys my wallet and my phone and lock it in the safe. I told her I don't give a fuck if I'm on the floor crying and pleading, dont give in and dont give me a fucking thing (phone or wallet) I'm done with this shit. These pressed m30s are the God damn devil and I'm to the point where I take them just to not get dope sick. I'm not going to lie though I do chase the high sometimes or most of the times and that's why I'm here. 

Apologies for the giant run on essay but again my question is how long will the worst last ? Can I at least function by day 3 ? Or will I still be a vomiting puking mess wrapped in 3 blankets in a 80 degree house ? I'll even take guesses at this point. I'm ready to kick this shit and I need some positivity. I hope the short half life of this shit will be to my benefit. I hope to God I succeed. I cannot afford to keep this habit up anymore. Financially, emotionally, my job and my relationship.

Any comments on this besides telling me I'm a pathetic piece of shit? Anyone kick these fent pills before ? 

Thank you for your time and any replies.


Quick edit. I'm a snorter.  I do not shoot up and do not take orally nor boof. Just snort. If that matters., ups: 3, downs: 0In the same boat but on some fent analogue sold as dope. I know how u feel man its horrible. Me and my fiance only used for 2.5 months and only use 1 or 2 bags a day and by the end of day 2 im fucking dying in pain and give in. We also have our wedding in 2 months. We are going to tell our parents we need help tomorrow. Its going to be awful. Literally want to fucking kill myself. We had so many chances to turn back and didnt and its mostly my fault. I wish it didnt take this for me to realize i cant ever touch a drug again but it did. And now im paying for it. Best of luck i hope u can make it to the other side manGo watch this video , it explains everything you want to know about withdraws from a cold blooded heroin addict .  https://youtu.be/40H92hBhzgUNice description. I can relate about it taking hours to get the motivation to stand up. Orient yourself with direction of bathroom. Proceed journey one door down hallway. Try not to collide with walls. And attempt to get piss in toilet. Doing anything is like climbing a mountain but way less fun. It's just beyond words bad. There is no point enduring it for some future lesson. Things that unpleasant cannot even be accurately recalled. All I have recorded in brain is it's probably the worst thing I have experienced in life easily. But that statement carries no weight to it. It's just like reading a sign in the road. After 20 years of opioid use and a complete rewiring of how my brain processes them no way my brain is transforming back into something that it no longer is. There isn't  any working help in this county. Every junkie I know has a bag full of subutex/suboxone but wants to take it like it's cyanide. Or has been through methadone clinic too many times and will never go through the fiasco again. Sorry didn't mean to piggyback on your post but I'm just feeling the same dread and hopeless of this b.s. countries system. I wish we had fent and fent pills around here. If it was more abundant and cheaper I'd have no qualms. Just real dope would be best. But since bth is so weak I'd love to actually feel my dope instead of WDs just subsiding enough to be depressed.Day three of presses withdrawal for me. Can’t sleep, can’t eat, it’s real fun. But I’m feeling better, less clouded in my head. The days just go on for so fucking long tho..Nice tryJudging by your username we prolly get the same or similar stuff and I had a similar habit to you timeframe and usage wise and it was rough.  This stuff out now has massive legs and half life compared to fent I’ve had before.  My only bit of advice, go grab a big bottle of Kratom powder or capsules.  Use that 3-4x a day during the peak of WD.  It will def help some.  Shits actually more expensive than dope in our area by far but if you need to quit it’s been a miracle for meBro we can do this. It's tough as fuck but delete and block all dealers numbers. Get some bars and have someone hold all of your bank cards and even car keys. Make it literally impossible to go find any or contact anyone and take off some days at work and keep popping bars. Might be a shitty plan but I have tuesday wednesday and thursday off. I plan to be sedated as fuck those three days. I'm doing my last dose tonight. Let's do this dude. Fuck ruining our lives to this shit. We are better than that.. day two is the fucking worst. Just get past that.Huh?God I wish kratom worked for me. Before I got into the hard shit I used the ever living fuck out of kratom.im talking 50 gram days. For well over a year. It was bad. Now the shit even though it's been a long time it still doesn't do anything for me. And I dont mean chasing a high either. It doesn't seem to help with wd but what the hell I'll try it again but I probably fried whatever brain matter responds to the kratom because it doesn't do shit. When I first got into kratom it got me fuckin high as hell. I'd take 15g at once and be ripped. Not anymoreWell at least you’ve felt any effects from Kratom before.  I’ve only ever used it when I had a fentanyl addiction so obviously I don’t feel a fuckin thing besides less sick.  Im kinda glad it’s that way tho bc it has 0 recreational value to me so I can use it a week for WD and stop it with no issues.  I can literally take 20 grams at once and it’s like I just took 1 Tylenol. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I was 4.5 months clean, Content: I got out of rehab in July, i relapsed on heroin within the week I got out. Thankfully i did it for one day and I was honest with my counselor and IOP (intensive outpatient group) and my Suboxone doctor. They said if it happened again, I would have to go back to rehab. Well I got 4.5 months clean and yesterday, I relapsed. I’m so scared to be honest about it, which I cannot lie because I take weekly urine tests. I don’t know what to say to my counselor when I see her today for an individual therapy session. The last few weeks I’ve been talking a lot about feeling like a relapse is gonna happen and going to extra meetings for that extra support. Unfortunately, a week ago, my boyfriend and I had a domestic violence issue and the cops arrested him and he went to jail for a night. In order to be released from prison, he had to sign an agreement that there would be absolutely zero contact between us until his court date in two weeks. So far so good. We also decided not to break up but are going to talk about it when we legally can speak to each other.  But I am very codependent with him which is something my counselor and I work very hard on. So this last week has been incredibly hard for me considering normally I just get high or drunk to not think about how much I miss him and how much I’m hurting. Also the entire year before I went into rehab we were broken up because of my heroin use. I moved back into my strict parents house on the agreement i would remain sober. Last night , my dad found my nodded off in my car and he woke me up and asked what was wrong. I told him I accidentally fell asleep cause I had been awake since 4am for work. Which is true and this was the first Saturday I worked in 2 years so he seemed to understand. But after he woke me up I said I would be right in, and I nodded off again and he came back out an hour later and yelled to wake me up. I’m pretty sure he knew cause I had cigarette ashes all over me and a cig butt burning at through my sweatshirt. I tried to play it off but my parents texted me this morning saying they know something is wrong and we need to have a family sit down talk. I agreed and told them about my boyfriend and I not talking and how stressed and depressed I am. What can I say to make them not think I relapsed? If I tell them I’ll get kicked out and I can’t afford to live somewhere else. Please any advice is much appreciated, ups: 1, downs: 0Dont feel bad for relapsing.

Being with an addict is a hard and difficult relationship in itself.

Oh, yes and if it wasn’t that DB it would be another one. He has a couple in every city just in case everyone or anyone is out, he can never be out. He has driven 3.5 hours one way to get the best quality stuff. Also he can be fronted from multiple DB. Most DB don’t know different, it’s like a family business and after a couple charges and you can’t get a better job than making 10+ ph, it’s hard to say no to making a couple grand a day when you only get a couple grand a month. Most DB I’ve met are smart and nice and their group is there ride or die. They aren’t selling to kill people they are selling to better there lives .... they warn people and tell them straight up... but free will and people will make their own choices.You can do it!!Same dude but I was out of town, thought I’d be able to ration my shit but nah lolEven if you relapse/fail, never stop trying.YO WHAT UP METRO? If young metro don’t trust you I’m gone shoot! You can do it bud. I just kicked a big 5 year habit cold Turkey bc I couldn’t ration properlyYou can do it bro real talk , watch this channel for motivation and inspiration from someone who's been there .   https://youtu.be/40H92hBhzgUGet kid of him before you lose your kids. If the police are watching you and you get caught with drugs with drugs in the same as the kids, the kids will be lost to
The system where they could be abused and raped. 

This is bad.

Put your kids before the drugs and junky BF. 

Also check out /r/randomactsofchristmas or r/santaslittleelf they give lots of toys for kids in need.

Put your kids first before they lose you. Your bf isn’t putting you guys first if he is using in the fucking living room and rather have drugs  than lights and water for your kids

Life is insane man. Good lucku/mccalleze2004 let me ask you a question. Do you hate the DB?Tell him it's the dope or you and the kids. Time to wake him up. I'm kicking my habit and it took seeing my wife sleep all day every day for weeks and weeks to realize what I'm doing to myself and to her. When you're hooked all you think about is the dope. You fall into a trance until you finally "wake up" and something snaps to make you do so. Best wishes and hope he cleans up.The cops are watching YOUR house? You may get arrested and lose the kids soon. Maybe the grandparents can house you and the kids while you save up enough to rent an apartment separate from him.Thank you for the encouragement for 2020That is a very mature attitude. Thank you.ThanksIt's so so hard to ration. Do you think that putting it in dub ziplocs might help one to ration to two dubs a day or something like that.?Thank you. I am going on MMT if I fail.ThanksThanksPoor kids.Never helped me. I’d just start pinching a little from tomorrow’s bag(s) and is rationalize using more than I’d planned. 

That being said - I have almost zero self control when it comes to dope.Or vivitrol after detox perhaps?I dont trust people who can control a dope habitYeah me2Yeah, I have to learn more about that..Same @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Has anyone taken subutex before the 24 hour mark in withdrawal with success?, Content: I have a friend who pretty much swears that he can take subutex even several hours after using H and says that it will not cause precipitated withdrawals for him. I’m wondering if this is even possible or if he’s just talking out his ass.

I’m curious as I’d like to induce subutex earlier than the 24 hour mark in my withdrawals if that is even an option. TIA!, ups: 1, downs: 0He's getting straight fentanyl. 4 hour half life compared to 12 hours for dope and 36 hours for methadone. Some dealers throw a little methadone in there to keep you hooked. Don't take the chance. Wait until you're really fucking sick before taking the subs. PWDs are no joke.Everyone is different but yes I’ve induced plenty of times before the 24 hour mark with no PWDIts not about time.. its about how severe the withdrawals are before you take the buprenorphine.  Some people have a very fast metabolism and they process drugs quickly, while others are slower. It also depends on the drug and the drugs half life.I just did it yesterday after about 12 hours. Also if you still have sub in your system from only being off a couple days you can just hop right back on.Generally after the 7-8 hour mark you’re fineI used to be able to dose suboxone after ~8 hrs, but since the dope turned to fentadope,  I need to wait longer.  
     Last time I waited 20 hrs and went into PWD like never before ... it was hell.  Just be carefulFent you looking at 36 at leastI usually just wait 12 hrs and I’m good.The difference here is between SUBUTEX vs SUBOXONE. Subutex is bupe, suboxone is bupe plus naloxone in a 80/20 ratio. Precipitated WD is from the naloxone so subutex can’t cause PWD and can be taken earlier @@@@@@@@@@ Title: The Myth of the 'Opium War' - The vast majority of opium users in China were not the desperate addicts portrayed by proponents of prohibition., Content: , ups: 95, downs: 0A drug and it's users painted with broad, negatively shaded strokes?

My old methadone doc actually recommended it to me and it's a really good book on the war on drugs and the government

There's so many things protraid wrong and when it comes down to it, it's all about money for and protecting the governmentreality is both scripted and augmented simultaneously ...in other words, its more than likely a projected hologram inside of a video gameand here were are thousand years later...more heroin, more fent, more death.

britain 'abolished slavery' prior to 1839?

bullshit! they were still sending convicts to australia for thirty years after this war

...and convicts were NOTHING more than slave labour  :(Being Anglophobic is politically correct now, that's all it is.  Most reddit users who talk about muh opium wars don't even know what decade or hell, even century it was.People will call you a white supremacist if you spread this ideamy exact thoughtYeah, but we were all also trying to quit tobacco. In China the opium wars are considered the same as the holocaust, dead serious. Anytime you try and talk about harm reduction with people from Asia you get called a “stupid guijin”. Dead serious, that’s the rhetoric they use to off yaba dealers with impunity.Not at all, even in some way or the other? Without confining myself to China, the classic "town drunk" goes back a long way, and I'd have to imagine similar enough concepts go back much further, but I do admit I've yet to be able to perform actual research[Listen to me Morty, take your clothes off and get in the shower with me right now!](https://youtu.be/cnFh3QEPyjUBecause there is way more profit to go one step further and make heroin out of it. If u want opium grow it urself or go  to south east asia. 

The high is kind if low and boring compared to heroin or morphin, hell or even codeine. Funnily the withdrawal is harder than the one from HeroinActually the opposite. The portrays a historical viewpoint that is positive for a race of people other than white caucasians

Based on your comment you’re probably some Donald trump supporting loser thoughThe point is that opium was seen as a tool of war and destruction used by whitesGo ahead, call the opium wars a 'myth' dude i dont care what u do...LolNobody is calling it a myth lol, the title is implying there are myths about it, just as with most historic warsOh i didnt have time to read it lolThe title of the thread?

Others are consistent users- either way when shit gets bleak and there’s no drugs around and you ask yourself why- what keeps you going?, ups: 1, downs: 0I keep going cause I didnt reached a point where I can see myself clean or when being clean is fun. Though because of some heavy money problems I am currently clean but its not nice, so being high is just more fun amd joy for myself.I dontUsually anger, if I get pissed off it doesn’t matter how much I’m sick. I can still work and get things done. It’s terrible for me, I know, but I do what I have to sick or not. I also had an alien or angelic experience when I was younger, dead sober too. Don’t know what it was, but if I’m down all the way, then I just think about that and I’m like “fine, I won’t pull the trigger”, also my mother is still alive and I can’t let her down, at least. So basically making the choice to have faith, faith in ones self is most important thing to be successful without drugs.I can see where you’re coming from, I’m not clean by want either. Probably wouldn’t be if I had the option.I feel that, my mother finding out I was an addict was the most heart wrenching shit. I can relate with the anger thing though it’s like an anger cloud oh just float past life on at times. It’s kind of a coping mechanism for me personally- I’ll be generally angry at the world instead of my specific issues.Yeah staying clean sucks so much for me. Id rather be high all day than do any shitty tasks with other people I dont like but I have to be social. All that stuff sucks. Just let me do what I want.Yea, moms are important, I’ve been able to keep it a secret from everyone so far, but I think it’s probably suspect.

And what this behaviour is from?, Content: So I got a relative who we suspect using something but we don't know, but we notice changes in his mood eg goes gym twice, which normally doesn't, paranoid, starts a fight etc. Physically he seem to be healthy like no loosing teeth etc etc. 

When he's using we tend to go with it and whatever he says accept as we know he's not at his normal behaviour but Im starting feel a bit bad about this and we should not allow it. 
What are your thoughts., ups: 1, downs: 0Trauma and pain are the main reasons most people start using more, and some just get introduced early on or it’s all they’ve ever known in their family sometimes. Addictive behavior in general can result in an addiction to something as simple as coffee or energy drinks. Gets as bleak as meth and opiate addiction- full blown alcoholism is fuckin scary as well. All though I’m going to say boredom & filling a void are the leading cause(s) of every stupid thing and every brilliant thing humans have really ever done. Understanding the cause and relating, being empathetic that most times that person just hurts on the inside.. justt my two cents on the topicThis world is fucking vicious..How long has this been going on?

Very small ("pinned") pupils (the small black part of the center of your eye) can indicate opioid / opiate use. But if his pupils are very large, it could mean cannabis (marijuana) use. 

But people who take opioids or cannabis aren't especially known for fighting, lol.

I don't know the physical symptoms of stimulant use, such as methamphetamine, which seems more in line with the behaviors that you cite. (Anyone?)

Of course, you would be able to smell substantial alcohol use.How do you know that it’s drug related? Does this person have a past with drugs or has he given you a reason to believe it’s drugs? Maybe it’s psychological?> But if his pupils are very large, it could mean cannabis (marijuana) use. 

more like stimulant use, Cannabis doesnt make huge pupils as far as I know, more like red eyesYa the rotten teeth part seems very meth like but it could also be coke or roids. Paranoia is also a good indication.

Or maybe the dude is just predisposed to be angry, doesn't brush and may have schizophrenia.

Who kmows �‍♂️Yes he has been using ice before and also have mental health issue so I'm not sure if his behaviour are from mental illness or drugs"crchealth.com
What to look for.
Marijuana:
Dialated (large) pupils"This.
He actually been diagnosed with schizophrenia and taking meds, but he also been known using ice and hes been trying to quitting it so not sure which is whichOk just because you sourced crchealth.com doesn't mean that the pupils of users who use cannabis are always large.... Been a daily smoker for over 5 years and have never seen somebody with large pupils, just red eyesI wrote some stuff about a fam member that is very similar to yours. If you go into my post history and look for a title that says "be kind to people with mental illnesses" you'll see a lengthy paragraph about it. It was from 1 day ago.*COMMENT HISTORY, not post history. My bad..As I stated in my first post: dilated pupils COULD indicate cannabis use.

So ye, cant come also, so its pretty normal, with me atleast.I cant cum if i am high on opiates, i can get hard n fuck for awhile but not actually cumminYes that is completely normal. Me and my girlfriend did a couple lines of subutex last night and fucked for 3 hours straight, i eventually just gave up�Try sniffing petrolPretty much any opiate is a cock block. For both parties don’t worry- girls are the same can’t nut to save a life sometimes.Idk about oxy’s I’ve never had sex on them but ik for a fact you can on codeineWhy don't you want?
I love it, causes the euphoria and the inner heatYou have to drink it... dumbass..Is it safe in combination with opiates?She wasn't high on oxys, so it was much fun for her, but hard work for nothing for me�Im not sure. Maybe i get interested in other things, like gaming or playing instruments, so much that i dont wanna have sex or i dont think about it. 
Although ive noticed that my libido decreases. 

But ye okay, sometimes i get really really horny and when i do get into that mode i know that then im REALLY horny heh.Oooofffff was she aware?

She knows that I love her more than everything else and that she is the most beautiful woman for me.
Yes I really gotta keep her by my side!!!Happy as fuck for you guys truly I hope it works out, I wasted 6 years of my life with someone I thought was like that for me. Trust and communication truly is fucking everything.You'll find the right one!
I've started to reduce that shit for her and at 2020 only kratom and weed, only allways be honest @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I know it sounds completely weird...but heroin and other opioids are good for my mental health. Just hear me out, Content: So I smoke heroin and take opiates pills. I become the best version of my self. I have motivation, I have the energy to things that otherwise I would avoid. It makes me clean my surroundings, it makes me connected with people, I enjoy talking to friends and family and have fun with them. I feel alive. I started taking care of my self. I look forward to the future, I'm making plans and go through them. I am optimistic and sociable. 

I haven't felt like that since before I started experiencing symptoms of depression and then receiving confirmation from my psychiatrist. 
Then I took an antidepressant which worked for 2-3 years, but then it stopped working. Then the whole frustrating process of trial and error began and I still haven't found an antidepressant that fits me.


Heroin on the other hand....I swear I couldn't accomplish even a fraction of what I managed to achieve while taking it. I was an anxious depressed mess. 
On a scale from 1 to 10, how fucked am I?, ups: 6, downs: 0Opioids in general are profound anxiolytics. They also tend to elevate mood, banish dysphoria and increase subjective feelings of wellbeing and contentment. They have long been known to possess these effects. The issue however arises because it is usually not sustainable long term. Aside from the deleterious physiological effects that opioids exert with chronic use, a tolerance to both the mood lifting effects and a diminishing return on their ability to blunt emotional pain, means that you require escalating doses to obtain the same benefit. 

That goes for both physical analgesia and coping with emotional pain. 

If and when you find yourself unable to sustain the habit due to either not being able to obtain opioids (licit or illicit) for whatever reason, the emotional pain, anxiety, depression comes roaring back & you discover that all you were ever doing, was masking the pain.

Now you’re still an anxious, nervous and depressed wreck, who is physically dependent on opioids AND going through hellish withdrawals. If you think you’re anxious now...

I personally would try to find a non opioid approach to managing your depression and anxiety. One that works long term. If however you have an inexhaustible supply of heroin, then yeah it could work out. But if not, it’s not a great position to be in. Buprenorphine works well for depression and has the benefit of being useful in maintaining sobriety in persons with opioid use disorder. Just a thought. 

Best of luck with everything and Merry Christmas �Have you considered a partial agonist like buprenorphine?  Opiates do have antidepressant like effects but in the long term, they really aren't all that viable as a treatment. Unfortunately,  many of the antidepressants on the market are aimed at correcting serotonin and norepinephrine imbalances, and for some of us, the depression is not related to that.  

I experience the same phenomena as you describe.  I get into my work. My house is clean. I have more interest in sex with my husband.. but thats all an illusion.  I fuck up more when I am high. Sure,  I clean the hell out of my house for a few days and even get my ass out of bed, but.. eventually I will stop doing that, too.  I am actually much better at everything when I am sober.once you build a tolerance. the mental benefits will diminish...i guess you're fucked

try to get out before you spend all your money, OD, or end up homelessI agree with you. Was on bupe for like 12 years. It's side effects were worse than the oxy it was supposed to replace. I'm supposed to be getting back on it but it hasn't went well. It's a bad habit to have because of propaganda and politics. There are some people who have mental disorders where nothing else works. That's just how it is. I'm not promoting them for anyone who can function without them. Even my psychiatrist can admit that this is sometimes the case. It's not a big deal or at least shouldn't be. Humans have been using the poppy for time immemorial. Not a big deal. Now potent pharmaceuticals are a little different, new and can be a big deal. You want to know what is a big deal? People living in low cost housing paying like 10% going rate rent. Living on SSI/SSDI and sending most of that money to drug cartels and narco-terrorists. Or being incarcerated for personal possession due to being addicted to opioids or any drug for that matter. That is what I see going on everyday all over the place. I'd call that a big deal. This is the situation being created. So instead of being dependent on a script that would cost pennies on the dollar they are getting it other ways. Dangerous ways with possibly dangerous substances. Then you've got the darkweb and that whole things. We are losing billions of dollars as a country and creating public health crisis and organized crime. This is a big deal IMO. All we can do is undercut the supply and reduce the demand through regulated sensible means. We'll be generating billions instead of wasting it. And of course educated people with real unbiased information on the subject.You´re fucked. U r basically me at the start of my year Long addiction.

First time using H was like being Feeling normal first time, because of Depression and anxiety. I was for one year the best vversion of myself, everything improved. until my tolerance build up so fast and I wasnt able to Sustain my daily use financially and had to withdrawl every few month because I ran out of Money. Soon it was mainly a struggle to get dope, to get Money and I no longer was the "best" version of myselfThe Best version of yourself can't be realized when using sorry buds. Mental illness is no joke and opiates may help short term but it's not manageable and all your problems and insecurities are still there under the fog.I'm going to school to be a journalist on drug neuroscience and I'm actually currently working on a paper that points out the therapeutic potential of opiates in treatment of mental disorders along the lines of depression and anxiety. You're definitly not the only one who feels this way!You're probably not using long enough then.Thank you for your thorough reply. I started going to a clinic where I can get prescribed long term management medication. Thank you and Merry Christmas �What are your thoughts on Methadone?This. All of this.Forgot to add: congratulations on being sober!


 Indeed our experiences sound similar. Did you manage to get past the PAWS? For me it's so so bad, even worse than quitting cold turkey. I can get pass the horrible withdrawal, I've done it and I got over the physical symptoms. But when PAWS kick in is.... my mental health is so bad I really can't describe in words.Thank you, yes I went to a clinic to get this prescription. Hopefully I'll have it before Christmas.Excellent for pain, good for maintenance, complex pharmacology. But overall, I like it. When I was on it for pain, I found it extremely effective. It’s not for everyone, but used judiciously it delivers excellent results.Benzodiazepines are a godsend for getting through PAWS and other postwithdrawal symptoms. They're addicting themselves, however.When you say PAWS what time frame would you say they occur. You mentioned h and opiate pills. I'm guessing faster acting ones like hydro/oxycodone. Like past two weeks out? Too me PAWS would be at a point when things start to feel like they are improving only to feel a return of symptoms. After a month I'm not sure if I'd be able to tell the difference from normal stuff like depression. That PAWS is so ambiguous.I could not get last PAWS! That is ultimately why I went onto low dose buprenorphine.   I was cold Turkey sober for about 9 months from heroin. I was still expecting such debilitating PAWS that if was either go back on "subs" or go back to using full time.That was fast! :)Thank you very much! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Thanks for all your encouragement, Content: I posted a few days ago about being afraid to detox on vacation.

Doctor put me on MS-Contin 30mg twice a day, a few months ago. The first 10 days I thought it was a miracle, I felt younger, better.. no back pain. Then the apathy started to slip back in and by 6 weeks I was back to “I don’t want to do anything“. I started sleeping too much but I did not have pain (no life either though). I’ve weaned myself down to 15mg twice a day. I got the PA to switch me from two 30s to three 15s, then I cut myself to two 15s... now the pain is back in force but I’m still sleeping until 10:00 AM (I go to bed 9:00-9:30, sleep about 11:00 PM). 
It’s just not ok. I dont know what to do but I am SICK of opioids. OH.. now I’m diagnosed with fibromyalgia too.. wonderful! Prescribed me generic Cymbalta for that. Three weeks and I was done with those side effects!
I wish I could just get clean and give a low dose of a good strong sativa a try BUT what if I can’t make it without pain meds? Going to a pain clinic for help is like going to the police for medical help.
I am at my wits end.
Over 15 years, they used to take care of me. Now because of the CDC and DEA I get enough to have all the bad side effects but not enough to make me feel like doing anything. CDC has lost all credibility.
I see doctor next Wednesday, Then I’m going to cut another 3.75mg. I’ve been dropping 7.5mg each time but it seems to be getting harder. If my back pain will allow, I will be off around January 1. 🙏
I am open to and asking for any advice. I have 1/4 pound of both Bali white and Red Maeng Da from Gol**n M**k. 
Plus I’ll be 68 yo in January, I really don’t want to live the rest of my life in either debilitating pain or debilitating apathy. Those aren’t good choices. I also have the means to try microdosing “Lucy”. Maybe I’ll give that a try too.
Getting an MRI for the best local spine surgeon tomorrow. I have always felt uneasy about spine surgery though.
I guess I seem confused and I guess I am. 
I’m asking for help/input because it seems like most everyone here has opiate addiction problems, I feel ya’. I was 18yo in 1970 and as we used to say, “I don’t use drugs.. I abuse them”. So I’ve been there too but I’m somewhere else now and I’m scared there is no exit.
Any help? Words of wisdom? Experience? Help??
Thank you., ups: 16, downs: 0Legitimate fibro patient here and I’ve been taking kratom for the past year paired with occasional opiates for pain as needed but daily kratom (and also kava sometimes) honestly have not felt better in years.I don’t think I can be of much help but I’m right there with ya with chronic pain. I’ve had it for over 20 years. I was never a drug or alcohol user. Pain go so bad I had to go to doctors to get help and they give you the run around for years before they actually help. I was on dilaudid for awhile. I was only getting 30 8mg a month which is a damn joke when I am in pain 24/7. No matter what I did I couldn’t get an increase and had no choice but to snort pills which wasn’t even close to enough either. I was sick and tired of spending my life in pain n not being able to do shit so I started buying H. I ended up failing too many drug tests and got kicked from pain management. So I’ve been using H for my pain for awhile now without any problems. I don’t have to worry about conserving what I have cuz I’ll just buy more. I snort I don’t shoot. I haven’t had a tolerance increase in years. I’m not looking to get high im looking to make life bearable. I hate to tell people to take H but it may just be the answer to what you need. You can control your pain and take it as needed without doctors breathing down your neck. I know what you’re going through and I really hope you find a solution. So sorry!microdosing acid isn't going to do anything for your back pain.  you'll get used to the side effects of oxy.  if getting them isnt a stressful unsure thing, i wouldn't feel worried about being on them at your age, unles you worry you will start over using them.Morphine does that to me but hydrocodone and oxycodone do not. Have you tried one of those? Both give me less pain with more energy. I take the lowest possible dose of hydrocodone so that I can knock the edge off the pain but still function. I also take it with coffee or some sort of caffeine if it’s before 2pm or so. It might be worth a try.I would look into low dose naltrexone. It's not necessarily compatible with opiate use because even at 1mg it'll affect opiates in your system, *however* it is being evaluated as a potent treatment for fibro. I take it right before bed every night so I can take painkillers for my pain during the day if I need to.

I deal with chronic nerve pain and it's helped knock my pain from like a constant 6/10 to a 2/10 so I no longer need any opiates.BTW, I feel no “high” from hydrocodone. If I take 60+ mg in mg in a day I get a little chatty because I feel a little better but never any itching or nausea.. I take half of a CVS brand magnesium tab every day and never get constipated, that’s ALL I ever get at CVS, they act like they know better than the doctor. Their magnesium just breaks pretty evenly.
Publix pharmacy fills my scripts, no question asked.. as long as it’s ok with doctor and insurance they fill. CVS acts like the police. Sad.Ive had them years ago, lots of x-rays and CT-scans. “arthritic changes, degenerative disk disease, facet syndrome”... my biggest problem is that since the CDC guidelines care has gotten worse and worse. 10 years ago I was on 5mg fentanyl patch every 48 hours along with 3 7.5 Vicoprofen every day, I was active, working and playing.. NOW... it’s like pulling teeth to get 40mg of hydro a day. There’s a difference. 
A couple months ago I had ulnar nerve transposition surgery. I was in the 30 mg of ER morphine a day and for 2-3 days took a 10 mg hydro every 4-6 hours. I actually felt normal. 120 mg bio equivalent of 120 mg of hydrocodone... I did not feel high, I felt like a human being and for a day or two did some of the things I used to enjoy but NO... I have to take 40mg a day... still hurt and feel bad too.
THAT is the problem. Poor medical care. If I got good care, I would be happy and productive but NO... the government has V a problwith me feeling good because addicts are dying from street drugs so in their wisdom the only choice they leave me is to go to the street or live in misery! But, I’m trying all my options first.
TY haa a njs for asking, �I'm in pain 24/7. I broke my back in 88. All the meds. The Doctor prescribes for my pain is hydrocodone plus Lyrica. 4 hydro a day and 2 Lyrica. The pain is with me. I like you am tired of Pain Management. The thing is I try to ask if there is  something that can help me  better. I tell you one thing I'm lived with the pain for 30 years. All I can say st strong.While I can’t speak to your back condition because I’m not a doctor, my dad had severe back pain and he was opposed to surgery as well. His doctor never prescribed opioids but after trying numerous other treatments such as cortisone shots and physical therapy. Eventually the sciatica nerve pain became to great and he agreed to get surgery. At this point he couldn’t move or sit up comfortably. He had surgery and was armchair-ridden for a week and his doctor prescribed Percocet. My family didn’t let him take them just to be safe and after a week he felt almost painless and some physical therapy helped him gain full strength and mobility at the age of 63. All I’m saying is look into doctors and specialists in other cities because no matter the cost it’s better than the price of addiction. Good luck!Man, I don't think I can help really, but I do feel for you. I fell into using being an irresponsible kid. You're a little older than my dad. I can't imagine being thrown into that situation at more than twice my current age. Wish you the best with this.It sounds like morphine is not the best pain killer for you. It can be very sedating. Oxycontin made me motivated and took care of my depression along with any pain. They try drug after drug when trying to find an antidepressant that works for people often to no avail. There are many different pain meds out there for the same reason. People respond differently to them and certain ones work better with different types of pain. To try MS-Contin and have it work but then have the common side effects become a problem isn't exactly exploring that class of meds. Many people say that about MS-Contin which is why there are other more popular ones. That stuff is very expensive as well. Morphine is pretty strong stuff but your dose wasn't very large. I agree how screwed up it is having the DEA actively involved with simple pain management. They should hit the streets not Drs offices.What’s causing your back pain?Consider giving a higher dosage of Cannabis a try like RSO, you can take it orally, maybe on some toast etc since it’s not the greatest tasting.

Maybe consider dosing multiple times throughout the day AM/Afternoon/PM and or in combination with a sativa so you’re not drowsy, or if you need something more switch to a indica dominant hybrid and or straight indica for more of a pain management. This could potentially help you to reduce opiates to a low dosage while allowing you to utilize something more natural to mitigate the pain threshold. Cannabis will definitely help, if you need more clarity from the cannabis a sativa will be better but I think a indica would be better suited for the pain as it’s heavier but will definitely give you more of a couch lock vs a sativa that will be more uplifting/energetic type of stony high. 

Lifting you up and hoping you feel better.People like kratom as an alternative to opiates, I haven't tried it cause it's illegal here but it sounds goodYes Hattie, I was on 4 10mg Norco a day, before that 4.5 but in my ignorance I ran my mouth that I had a good month and had gotten by on 4 a day... so from 4.5 to 4 I went. I managed for about a year and then asked to go back to 4.5... dr decided to once again put me on ER meds, they never work well for me. I’ve been on Avenza (morphine 90 Er with three 7.5 Vicoprofen... same with fentanyl patch, Nucenta ER, Butrans patch,... back to Norco (hydrocodone 10mg) 4.5/4 a day. Then the PA tried me on Percocet, 7.5mg at 4.5 a day. Percocet works very well for me but it comes on in 30 minutes and starts to fade in 2 hours, in 3 hrs it’s pretty much gone. Norco takes 45 minutes to get going but lasts 4-5 hours for me...
So, last February when I asked to go from 4 Norco a day to 4.5 the doctor decided I needed the ER AGAIN... first it was the new “abuse deterrent” formula of OxyContin called Xtampza ER..  stay far away from this drug. It works but is hydrophobic, so you have to eat a high fat high calorie meal with it, you can do with a medium but the more fat, the better it works. It is made with carnival wax and (iirc) coconut oil. In three months I gained 10 pounds and went from pre-diabetic to Diabetic, so now I’m on Metformin too... BAD MEDICINE!
Then they wrote me a script for generic OxyContin which too half a day to figure out.... you cannot get it, no one has it! Then they wrote the MS-Contin and here I am.
Yes. Hydrocodone works best for me. I take two when I wake up (8:30 AM), 1-1/2 or 2 around noon, two  butalbitol/APAP/caffeine and 1mg clonazepam at 3:00, then a half a Norco at 5:00... in a perfect world. Another clonazepam at bedtime with melatonin and I sleep through the night. It works for me but sometimes I need a little bump, I never run out. If I have 4.5 a day I usually have 15-20 leftover every month, it’s how I made it through on 4 a day, I had 190 stuck back because I no longer trust my doctors.

My conundrum.. if I stay on the morphine... maybe I can keep cutting back until I get off. If I go back on the Norco it’s hard to stick with a taper, but I reckon I can do it. I guess it’s the best. I’ll push for 4.5 but after what the CDC did with
their stinking “guidelines” it is hard to get enough to have a life.

Thank you for the reply, it helped me to think through things and see what I need to do . Well, MRI tomorrow but I just have a bad feeling about surgery. Don’t know why.

Here’s to being awake! �❤️ 

Thank you again. 
From Georgia USAThanks... I’ve only tried it as couple of times, it’s a PITA to prepare and take. I did notice it reminds me a lot of the old Mexican Brown, warm fuzzy.. don’t want that.Will keep that in mind! I may go through with surgery then go to things I believe will help like microdosing, Sativa, and maybe low dose Kratom,Nah... I have oxy. hydro, and morphine... I always hold back. I use it, in over 15 years I’ve never run out early or gone doctor shopping. I don’t really like opioids. I much prefer more of an upper. 
The only reason I ever take opioids is for pain.
I always liked acid, I have no fear of a microdose, I just can’t seem to find the right time. 
I realize I’m not 20 and I’m not going to take something like Sunshine or a Windowpane.. I don’t want one of my kids to knock on the door and me not know who or what I am... lol. Not that, not anymore. It had its day but perhaps it can be a medicine! It mimics serotonin and I believe dopamine. If I have a good headspace, and I usually do, I’m not depressed by any means.. maybe it’ll make me feel better, maybe it will help me decide to feel better.Morphine is more notorious than other opiates in producing tolerance. A combination of opiates (eg. methadone and morphine) will greatly help with tolerance if you're gonna need them for pain relief. You might considering trying that.All things considered I’m just frustrated, in pain, would love to be off these meds and feel like doing something again. Maybe this is just part of getting older, I dont know but I’m gonna try something else because this isn’t working anymore because of the government’s “opioid crisis” which I am not a part of other than being a victim of the solution. Maybe this will all work out well. Desperation moves things along.
I know I can only do so much without risking what little care I’m getting.
Thank you for the replies.
Going to get a NEW MRI tomorrow and will go from there.
Thanks again.
I’m sorry if I am confusing.... I am confused.
I’ll leave it there and check back later in the week.
Thanks againHave you tried going to a chiropractor, deep tissue massage, Cupping, acupuncture?I understand your frustration.  I was a pain clinic patient for 7 years (2008-2014).  I had two spinal fusions around age 30.  Got hooked to every opioid they threw my way - Norco, Percocet, Oxy, up to Fentanyl patches with Morphine for breakthrough.  I’m lucky to be breathing.  Then came the depression and massive anxiety regarding my next prescription.  Finally I got popped on a drug screen for meth.  It was the craziest day getting kicked out of pain mgmt, deemed the “least likely” patient to breach their contact.  

Honestly it was the BEST thing that ever happened.  Cold turkey detoxed off Oxy and Percocet at a much higher dose than you listed, and it really wasn’t that bad.  A week into it I was back at work, in an outpatient rehab program, and starting to take care of myself again.  It was much easier to suck it up once then deal with the small dosage cutbacks every 30 days.

It’s coming up on 5 years off any hard narcotics.  I take Lyrica, the occasion Valium for back pain, one 50mg Tramadol a day, and an ADHD med that has worked wonders.  These are all prescriptions and taken as written.  3-4 times a week I partake in weed (to sleep or to have a productive weekend day when I’m in pain).  After detox, I noticed I wasn’t in nearly as much pain as my body thought it was while on opioids.  If you leave pain mgmt on your own, you can always go back.  I‘m not sure I’m welcome unless I need another surgery!  Sending positive thoughts your way :)You get it. Thank you.I'm a stage IV cancer patient and I totally feel you. I hate pain and I also hate being emotionally numb. Kratom worked pretty well for me without making me all apathetic but my oncologist doesn't want me using it because it hasn't been studied enough and he doesn't want it to interfere with my treatment (which I agree with). Give kratom a try but keep in mind if you ever decide to quit it can be very difficult for some people to get off it. Edit: I have stage 4 breast cancer that metastasized to my spine and left hip. Cancer in the bones is painful afYou can’t find generic OxyContin anymore. Brand name is not covered and would break the bank. The MS-Contin is really cheap. Both insurance and cash pay are under $20 for 90 pills but I’m just sick of it. It’s either off completely or back to 60mg. No use in having pain and crummy side effects. My option is off, if I can do it. I’m at that point of indecision. I have to remember that I’m trying to get off. A couple more dose cuts and then jump. I just worry that the pain will be too much and I’ll have to go back, that will be discouraging but at least I’ll know. 
Thanks �I highly suggest doing some research on kratom. Go to the aka (American Kratom association) for scientific evidence, dont just Google it because you will come across a bunch of horror stories put out by big pharma cuz they are losing money from millions of Americans switching to kratom. Watch "a leaf of faith" on Netflix, very insightful and if u are on fb search kratom support group, you will fi d thousands of people in your same situation that have gotten their lives back from this incredible plant. 

It saved my husband and I from a 10+ yr addiction (both stemming from injuries) that at its worst was costing us 40k/yr to buy pills. No motivation, sleeping all the time, financially crippled and worst of all still in pain. Kratom gave us our freedom back. We switches cold turkey to kratom from about 400mg/day oxy (yes, a ridiculously high number) to taking about 6grams kratom every 3-4hrs and were still able to function like normal adults. By day 3 felt like new people. But I cant stress enough do your research and speak with people who have used it long term. It is a mysterious plant but 100% a lifesaverThe best thing to do is stop being "scared". What the hell of you scared of? You can't stop what is coming. If u are in a free state, go grab some heavy ass Indica  distillate, dump 2 grains of rice size dabs on a pill and down it. You will be flying in no time[deleted]It's sad but true, your case is classic. This is what people have to resort to to get relief from chronic pain. I can't believe that this is reality and not a screwed up dystopian movie. I'll bet they don't even have a clue of the statistics yet.If I could find it I would but that’s one thing I can’t seem to get a line on. I can get blotters or weed, but H is elusive for me... obviously not for BBC a lot of people. BTW, I wouldn’t shoot either. Did when I was young but not now.
Thanks! I’ll keep an eye out and my ears open!
How much is a quarter T these days?Thank you, I’ll look into that!Sounds more like your family wanted them percs.Arthritis and degenerative disk disease. Finding out more with MRI.Pain clinic here... doctor is like police. Urine testing, cut you off if you fail., cannabis will make you fail. I’m in Georgia. That’s why I want to get off opioids so I can try other things without risking everything and being labeled an abuser by the doctors.
Thank you!
It’s been a couple of years since I tried it. Street name was LOUD and it was, SKUNK. 
I big toke, one small toke.... perfect. I’m sure with regular use it would take a little more. It’s side effects trouble me a little, especially not dreaming. In the 70s I didn’t dream for several years. When I stopped smoking every day... about three days later I was dreaming in my dreams.. that can’t be really good for you, to not dream.
However, when I tried it a few years ago it was like the top of my head opened up. It cured my ADHD and pain AND... I felt at least 20 years younger!
I am just confused right now. I’m in pain, the meds help a little but I can’t stand feeling so controlled!
Thank you.Kratom will cause the same apathy and oversleeping problemsWould help tremendously if you would reply directly to the comments that a given post is addressingTY but no, I don’t want to get in deeper and from what I read that stuff is tough to kick,
I might try the fentanyl patch again. Last time I was on it I was on the Mylan generic. It’s a film patch and though they say you cannot, you absolutely CAN cut pieces of it off and slowly make it smaller over a month or more and get off it with no withdrawals whatsoever. I did it with a 50ug per hour patch... easy!I went to chiropractor and deep massage a lot, early on. Chiropractor helped until one day he made it worse. I have a slight curve in mid thoracic. Somehow he managed to tweak the nerve that goes from there around to the area/muscle just at the bottom of my rib cage, next the the sternum, I was on my stomach, he raised the table and when I went to oust myself upright that muscle spasmed, it’s done it regular ever since, especially if I bend over to tie my shoes or such. It started all of a sudden and has just been a part of life ever since. When it happens I have to stand up and lean back a little while taking a deep breath. That usually stops it.
Deep tissue massage has never done a thing for me. Last several times I hurt more the next day then back to normal.
I hope I can just get off the opioids and see how I feel without them. Maybe I’ll feel better, maybe worse but at least I’ll know.
I’m not telling my doctor anymore though. I don’t want them to cut me back more then me realize I need more. 
We will see but chiropractor used to help when my neck and shoulder got knotted up. Massage.. never.Bless you, please beat it.I’m not.. I’m in the backwards state of Georgia. I’m scared of surgery. Surgeons can make you better or they can make you worse.
I really don’t like indica and absolutely hate “headband”... I like a cerebral sativa that gets me up and makes me forget I hurt, makes me work with my DAW and do things I love. Indica just gives me couchlock. I truly love a landrace sativa like Columbian Gold, Jamaican, Vietnamese Black, Thai Stick... though the best I ever had was Gainesville Green. I was sitting on granite steps in downtown Tallahassee and someone I had never met asked me if I wants to smoke a joint.. SURE! He pulled out this “pin joint”, we smoked the little thing and the steps disappeared... I swear, there were sand dunes, a caravan, and an oasis. I dont know, maybe it was laced with DMT but that really isn’t DMT style... second was Vietnamese. I had a VW camper-van, smoked a bowl. GF was curled in the floorboard crying. I looked back and the camper van was at least 30 ft deep and looked like a hunting lodge. Indica don’t forget that!
CBD does nothing for me but really good sativa distracts me from everything, alas.. first I have to find a way off the opioids, I have to find my own way because the government approved way is just not working for me! 
TYI’ve been through all that years ago. I know what disks are bad, at least in the cervical area. Tried PT, tried trigger point injections (broke out with roaming eczema for three weeks each time, only thing that has worked has been opioids... massage, worse next day. I dont know...
Thanks for the ideas though!You’ve been going to a pain clinic for 15 years and NOW you’re getting an MRI??I haven’t dealt with pain for that long (since 2012).. but in addition to my back pain (same as yours) with two lumbar surgeries, I developed a movement disorder similar to Parkinson’s.. so my docs put me on FENTANYL during this time.. after I got severely addicted and ruined my life, I finally JUST had surgery for the spinal cord stimulator. It was outpatient, not too awful recovery, and my pain is SO MUCH BETTER. I’ll have pain my whole life, so I’m trying to choose options that let me live medication free. Maybe that’s an option? Do you live in a state with MMJ??Same here. I have 4 herniated discs to throw on top of it. Mine are all in the thoracic area.I’m sorry, what did you ask me?
I’m trying... I see a post click on it and answer. If I’m not doing it right, gimme a break please, I’m trying.I think I see what you mean . Somehow I was seeing answers in a list, separate, not like a thread and was answering there. I cannot even find that now. Maybe tomorrow or Tuesday I can copy/delete/paste and put everything in order. I’m sorry, didn’t know what I was doing.I see now. I was looking in my inbox and clicking the envelope ✉️ I con, I didn’t realize it was making a mess.. ��No MMJ. I know what you mean. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Drug users union, Content: Learning about harm reduction was pretty integrated into my addiction, and obviously it's something I've gotten pretty passionate about. Recently I've been listening to Crackdown Podcast (absolutely worth checking out) and their most recent podcast in which Garth Mullins goes to Scotland to investigate their overdose crisis, and gives a presentation on starting a drug users union.

Are any of you members of a drug users union? Have you thought about organizing one? Would you be interested in forming or joining one in your city? I'm just super interested in the idea of creating one in my city, and want to get your ideas, experiences, and feedback!, ups: 3, downs: 0There's [INPUD (International Network of People who Use Drugs).](http://inpud.net/)

I’ve never used drugs because of depression I don’t even smoke but I’m at a low and so confused with this girl I’m struggling. Hoping the hydros take the edge off I need to think about anything other than her. Any advise on what to expect the high to feel like, also is 10mg enough to even get a high. Also is it a bad idea to drink after taking these? Btw m21 210lb 6’2, ups: 2, downs: 0If you’re drinking to forget, you have my blessing. But stick to the booze. Don’t add the hydrocodone into the mix as well. Especially if you’re opioid naive (don’t have a tolerance). It’s dangerous and I really don’t recommend it. 

Two hydrocodone and a beer won’t hurt. But if you’re emotional, they lower inhibition and it’s very easy to intend to have “a beer” and end up staring at an empty bottle of Jack Daniels. If you have depression and are emotional, taking opioids and getting shitfaced can be a recipe for impulsive:

“Fuck the world, fuck this woman, I’ll show everyone! Now where’s my .357...” type behaviour. 

Opioids lower your respiratory drive (how often you breathe) as does alcohol. Both are CNS depressants. This doesn’t end well. Stick to the booze and save the hydrocodone for another time. 

We’ve all been there man, plenty of fish in the sea, time heals all wounds and all that stuff man. 

Take care of yourself.pick 1 and stick to itI’m done taking stuff for tonight but how much do you think I have have to take to feel any sort of high?Ignoring everything else and just answering the question, then if you’re opioid naive, 10-15mg of hydrocodone should give you the “ensconced in a warm fuzzy blanket feeling” that you’re after. 

That’s roughly equivalent to 10mg of oxycodone, which is the maximum I recommend anyone try for their first time or when they have zero tolerance. 

Good luck and Merry Christmas � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Who else is gonna be sick tonight?, Content: The title says it all lol. I've been just getting by. I lost my job Wednesday found a new one Friday that is 10 times better I started Saturday worked today and I'm done training. It's a bar job at a country club so there is good money to be made just not the cash tips I'm used to. I've cut down and ran out of money today. My last shot was at 9 am. I took some lope earlier and I have some more to get me through but damn I really need some dope. Friday is payday for me and my bf. I'll have a paycheck from my other job and maybe a 2 day pay from this one I'm not sure. I Don't know how I'm gonna make it through. I seriously broke down and cried in the parking lot of my job going home because I couldn't go score sad but true. I'm trying to hold it together I really am but damn I need some dope. Ugg I hope you guys are all doing better than me atm. Be safe guys, ups: 4, downs: 0Congrats on the new job!!! Fuck. I’m sorry you’re in this spot, just gotta hold out till Friday, yeah? :(

I recently decided to give myself a tolerance break later in the week, so I bought a shit ton of ketamine and am gonna see how long I can k-hole myself through WDs to get a little break from the dope lol

Lope is indeed magic though, is your tolerance low enough for it to help at all, or does it just dull it a little?

Sending junkie good vibes your way! �����Bruh I’m not here to judge or nothing because I love pills and coke but if u crying because u can’t get dope maybe it’s time to take a breakThere could be a chance that people might tip you as well. Unless they only ever pay using a club account or something. People at those type places like to throw their money around lol so you might end up being surprised.Sorry you’re in that spot but at least there’s an end in sight. And congrats on the new job! Out of curiosity, is the lope holding you okay? Do you mind me asking how much you dosed? Good luck OP.r/borrow/r/CryptoCurrencyGet some kratom to hold you over. Do research on how to properly take it cuz many people dont take it correctly and then end up thinking it's useless (myself included the first few times til I did some research) you'll have to get from a smoke shop which is shit quality but it helpsi will be soon ���Aww I wish I could k-hole through it lol. Thanks it's actually a really good job but I'm gonna need a piss test which I'm pretty sure I can use someone's piss lol. Lope is doing ok for me of course I have to take alot of it but I'm actually ok.i was looking and with my bank account if I get a paycheck like I think I'm supposed to they will pay me 2 days early so I might have money Wednesday I'm not counting on anything at this point but I'm hopeful.i got my schedule and it's pretty nice so I'm happy. I'll tell ya what though Friday I'm partying like a fucking rockstar no questions asked lmao �. Good luck with your breakYes, this!. This isn't an attack by any means. It's time to snap out of it and clean up. Each wd day is hell but each day completed is PROGRESS@@Well the girl I trained with tonight made $80 cash tonight so it does happen she said it does. It's just going to take some getting used to be budgeting myself .Thank you !! I'm using right and yes lope helps alot.I really dont think anyone is gonna loan me money lol I mean I'm good at paying back but my post history is pretty much here �Yea but she’s broke.  If she had money she could get dope lol.  Kratom isn’t exactly cheap especially headshopYeah I get that. At least there’s the chances of walking out with cash when you don’t expect it!When you get your money, buy suboxone, kratom, lope, Tylenol 3, gabapentin and other comfort medicine. Plan that when you run out of money, you can fall back on your comfort medications.If you can show good financial history many will take the chanceIt's a blessing and a curse lolThat is the most solid plan I have seen yet. I am for sure taking this advise for real. I'm not getting in this position again. I mean I usually have lope on hand and I must say it is a big help for me. I used to have a script for gaba which won't be hard to get back .Really ?? How do I do that ? I mean I'll give it a goI took your advise im hoping something comes through I really do pay my debts lol that's why I'm broke I pay my bills first always .WDs will be reduced, so that you are only uncomfortable..Yea I figure that much thank you though @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Do you, or does anyone you know, chip H successfully?, Content: Simple question. For those of us with habits we are way, way past this point, but I'm curious if long-term chippers exist. I know personally of at least 2, but both were alcoholics and I think the only reason they didn't get hooked is that alcohol was their DOC. I'm sure people like this exist, but they probably don't advertise it, for obvious reasons. And of course, once you've been hooked, there is no going back to chipping. Those neural connections are formed, and will spring back once heroin is re-introduced, but I'm wondering if there are people that have avoided that trap. Not "tried it once and never touched it again", but people who use it sometimes for a long period without getting hooked.

Is this you or someone you know? Are these people just a myth or are they just secretive?, ups: 6, downs: 0I knew one redditor in this sub who shoots smack three consecutive days every month and that's that. If there's anything in his story that makes chipping possible, he works in Macau and will only travel to HK to score. Hat tip to the all chippers out there.I don't know anyone like that but I went from using everyday to chipping and have been for the past almost 6 monthsthey're a myth. people who chip end up making the smart decision to stop for the rest of their lives. or they fall into developing a habitI am currently in an MD clinic so I no longer have to worry about withdrawl. I do dope now whenever I CHOOSE to. When I can afford it and when I have the appropriate situation. The big deal for me is that using, or not, is now totally up to me. When I was using daily, I had to have it, period. One way or the other. Currently my normal routine is to pick up either a G or a half G sometime around payday (every 2 weeks). Other than that I may use again maybe one more time randomly during those two weeks if I have a friend that brings some around or if I hear that theres some real fire around or something. Now, all that being said, I am under no illusions, if I was suddenly no longer in the MD clinic, I would be screwed and probably back to daily use.hi that’s me ! i’ll occasionally get a gram of H and use a little a day til I run out. Mostly because heroin/opiates in general are hard to find where I am. It’s like a nice treat really.I started using kratom daily when I quit using meth. Now I do a gram of h every couple months for the last 2 yearsOxy.  But yes, I chip.  One a week on the weekend.  5 or 6 years now.Not really sure if I'd consider this chipping but..I mainly use kratom now but I'll have some small binges here n there. Used h for like 3 years prettyy hard and dont wanna go back to that so yeh.[deleted]Thats an impressive move going from daily yo chipping. How did you do it? Did you have a plan? And how did you feel when you initially transitionedthat's great man. How often do you use? I hope you manage to keep it up and I hope it's not so regular that a negative life event could cause you to go back to daily. How long was your habit for before?? I've *tried* to chip since being hooked, but since it only takes 3 days for me to get physical withdrawal now, I always end up pushing it a little too far and then getting ill and caving and going back to daily use. I've thought maybe if I quit for a long time and came back to it, *maybe* then I could chip, but no way could I do it anytime soon after giving up.Exactly my situation rn. But I'm using more than I would like to admit. Have been on MMT for around 1,5 months and had around 20 clean days during that time. I'm on 8ml levopolamethadon (appr. 80mg of methadone but without a buzz, just no WD) and the cravings are still there when I'm not using.where do you live? When I first got into drugs, I didn't have the first clue where I could get H. I didn't know any heroin users, and the dealers of all the other drugs I took - weed, base, coke, pills etc - didn't fuck with H. I assumed it was at least rarer than those drugs. A few years later I got friendly with a H user, who introduced me to my first dealer, and then it was like a whole new world opened up in front of my eyes. It turns out that I was so wrong - heroin dealers were more pervasive than any other, even weed dealers. They were on 24/7, unlike any of my other dealers. It actually turned out that 2 heroin dealers lived *on the street where I grew up*. The same fucking street!!! My point is, you may think H is rare where you are, and though you may be right, if it is at all an urban area or close to one then you probably just don't know where to look. 

can I ask how long you've been doing this?? How do you feel when you run out?? I assume no sickness, but do you feel depressed/fatigued/bored etc??Are your binges H or kratom?? If they are H and you use kratom in between then I'd say that's definitely chipping. How long have you been doing it like that? It doesn't take quite the same degree of self control as using H sporadically then having no opiates at all, but it takes a HUGE amount of discipline every time you put the heroin down and go back to Kratom and for that I admire you, especially since you've had a heroin habit before. I tried something similar with bupe, and though it sort of worked I was never very happy on subutex and found myself looking forward to my heroin sessions constantly.You mean the Chinese government?I was basically forced into it. My life turned upside down in one day and wound up moving so when I moved I don't have a plug out here and my dudes far from where I'm at so I can't see him as much as I'd like. I had no plan I didn't expect it to happen. And it sucked for a bit still sucks now honestly but it's whateverI live in a city in Australia. 

You’re probably right - I know a lot of users but only a few people who do opiates, and all of them get their stuff either from finessed scripts or the deep web. 

I’ve been doing drugs since July last year (so not very long lol, but I’m only 19). After a heroin binge I don’t really have any negative effects that I could name. I usually have benders during my uni breaks so afterwards I’m right back to studying. Kinda like going on a lil holiday. It’s refreshing, really.H binges, I use kratom daily (apart from when I do dabble with h). I meann since like a month or two after I got out of the hospital around April but its not a "once a week" or "planned" thing like that. Just once in a while I'll get enough for like a day or two then back on my kratom after that, I dont really have the $ to support a habit for one and two I really dont want to go back to the way I used to be..No IV either so just plugging and monkey water usually. 

Thanks man, I went through a lot of shit last yr thanks to dope so that's a pretty big deterrent. I'm usually happy with kratom and some bud.hahah, man. Your other post gave a different impression. No offence, but if you literally have no other choice then I think you're a chipper just by circumstance. Do you think if you still had connections local to you you'd still just be a chipper?? Are you using regularly enough that you don't get sick but do feel pretty depressed & shitty when you're sober?I grimaced when I read this post. My automatic first thought was that I'm reading the post of someone that's going to become addicted to heroin in the near future. I really, really hope I'm wrong, and I don't want to be an asshole, but I have seen it happen countless times & we have all read the stories.

Answer this question to yourself - you don't need to post your answer. Imagine that for some reason someone told you that you'd never be able to take heroin ever again. How would you honestly feel about it? Would you think "that's a shame. oh well" and that was it? Or would it cause a sinking feeling in your chest, a deep sense of loss & sadness? If you really consider this and find that you honestly would feel equanimous about it, then maybe you'll be OK. If it's the latter, then you may need to think about your relationship with heroin. I really don't mean to be a dick here, but it's just almost textbook "honeymoon phrase"" - the calm before the storm, the time we all had before our first withdrawal changed our lives forever. I hope I'm wrong, but please, just do some introspection and figure out if you have the handle on this you think you do.I hope you keep it up. I don't want to rain on your parade, but a month or two isn't very long. Don't become one of the cautionary tales of why chipping doesn't work. If I were you, I'd set strict guidelines about how often you will let yourself use H, and then start being very very alert if you start relaxing those boundaries. I know you don't want to plan it, but if you are vague & entirely loose about how often you want to use, then it will be easy to talk yourself into doing it more & more regularly, until before you know it you're getting sick & the Kratom isn't stopping it. 

btw, a little off topic but I tried Kratom once - I think it was "bali" - when I was starting to withdraw from heroin. I did some, waited, did more, waited, then did loads and loads as the H withdrawal started to come on and I was extremely eager to do anything to stop it. The Kratom may have taken the edge off a little bit, but other than that it did nothing - the withdrawal still came and I certainly wasn't *high*, at all. Does this mean Kratom just doesn't work for me? May it have been the wrong brand or type? Did I not take enough?? Is it worth giving another try?Also I feel ya on getting excited for the h..sometimes I still get too excited for my dose in the morning then I cant sleep or get up wayy too early (tho that could be coz of meth too lol).My bad I feel you lol I'm just saying that's how things are now and if I had connects local id be doing it a lot more often. I get sick sometimes because sometimes I'll pickup a lot but yeah basically just shitty and depressedprobably moreso an “oh well, that sucks” for me. I’m in law school and plan on practicing, so I know I’ll eventually have to stop using everything. For me, drugs are a hobby. That sounds stupid - I know, but it’s true. 

Heroin isn’t really my drug of choice, it’s for sure in the top 3, but my #1 goes to ketamine. 

You might be right, maybe eventually I’ll be an addict, but I don’t know, I really doubt it. I don’t have an addictive personality (that’s what they all say, right?). I did have a rough few months with xanax last year and after that, I definitely don’t plan on letting myself get hooked on anything else anytime soon. But you’re right, it absolutely could happen. I just sure hope it doesn’t.Thanks. Well been maybe about 6 months or so but yeah that's not super long, though last yr I literally almost died from endocarditis (coma for a week, intubated etc) and was in the hospital for about 4 months. So pretty safe to say I'm not gonna go back to how much I used to use, cause if I do I WILL die. I appreciate your concern though and might need to think something up when I start getting more $ but honestly at this point I dont like using more than a couple days at a time. After a little while it's just too much..that and many other reasons.

Hmm well whenever I get off the dope binges and go back to kratom theres always a couple days where I won't feel much of a buzz but do get relief from withdrawal (if I have any, which I usually dont) but after those couple days of taking kratom I start getting a real nice buzz again. Probably something to do with tolerance and letting the receptors clear up if i had to guess. 

Anyway yeah I think it's worth another try, could've not worked for you cause of that reason, or could've been cause you didn't take enough or it was just shit quality stuff. You're not gonna be getting a high exactly like heroin or a real opiate but it is somewhat similar to a low to low-mid dose of opiates with an upper edge.if you had connects you'd probably have a habit and be a daily user, right?? Man, the thing is sooner or later you'll find someone where you are. It's not hard to find H dealers, especially if you have a little disposable cash and then you'll be back to where you were before. How often are you using H?? I found that before my habit when I used heroin a couple of times over every 2 week period that in between I'd be fucking miserable - bored, sad, empty, totally unmotivated, lethargic etc. Nothing on actual withdrawals, but a really unpleasant way to spend most of my life while waiting to get high.Firstly, heroin hooks many people that don't have an addictive personality. It's on par with meth for its uncanny ability to turn disciplined, conscientious self-controlled people into addicts. I say this as someone who had used all manner of drugs - weed, alcohol, speed, MDMA, benzos, even opiates like oxycodone - extensively but had never had a problem with any of them, until I got into H. 

Secondly, if you really had a totally non-addictive personality then why did you have some trouble with Xanax?? I'm not really a downer person - I always used to love stimulants and never saw the appeal of benzos except as a tool for stimulant comedowns/sleeping, and many times have had packs and packs of diazepam/lorazepam/temazepam sitting in a draw and was never tempted to take them recreationally. Despite my preference for uppers & my lack of addictive tendencies, heroin ended up getting me, just like it gets the vast majority of people who fuck with it. 

>I definitely don’t plan on letting myself get hooked

Did you plan on letting yourself have a problem with Xanax? Or was it just something you enjoyed that you started taking more regularly and you didn't even realize it was a problem till it was too late? Nobody plans to get hooked and nobody lets themselves get hooked. That implies a lot more agency than there actually is in the process - it's not as if they make a conscious decision one day to fall into addiction. It starts with people using as you are now, then the frequency may increase a little, the amounts they're using are nudged up a little bit, the gaps in between the sessions get shorter, more reasons are found to do it again, the time in between using gets a little greyer and a little duller and the desire starts to increase. 

Every single step of the way is incremental so that it's rationalized away easily. "I'm just stressed right now so I'll take it a little sooner", "I deserve it this week, I'll make sure I go a month without after this", "I have some extra money, might as well stretch the weekend session into the week" "I may be doing it a little more often, but I don't plan on letting myself get hooked, so I don't have to worry". 

H is so insidious because at the start you get away with using entirely consequence-free. It's similar to benzos in that respect, but IMO heroin is way more deceptive. No big hit to your wallet, hangover, comedown, regrets - it's all great at the beginning because you're experiencing something so pleasurable and paying absolutely no price for it. It lulls you into a false sense of security, but then once you slip up one time and use daily for just a few days more than the time before or up your dose just a bit more then all of a sudden you'll get your first withdrawal & then the days of using like you once did are over, forever. From that point on you won't be able to get away with using for more than 2 days without getting the sickness, and the sickness only gets worse the longer you keep on using, and then the real fun begins. 

I just get the impression from your post that you're paying lip service to the idea of caution and the reality that it could happen to you, whilst the subtext of the rest of what you've said shouts out that really it's never going to happen to you. If you had told me you were a cashier at a 7/11 or something I wouldn't be bothering with this follow-up post, but you're young and going to law school! You could have a really bright future ahead of you, but I promise that there is nothing on this earth that can derail your life more utterly and quickly than heroin. Your aspirations, dreams & entire life are in one hand and heroin is on the other. Even if you can't be convinced that the chance of you getting addicted to heroin is anything more than slim, wouldn't you agree that even taking that small risk considering what you have going for you is monumentally reckless and short-sighted?? Wouldn't you agree that, even if the odds of it happening to you are small, the very fact that there's a chance makes it crazy to continue?? I can't guarantee that you will or won't become hooked on heroin, but one thing I can categorically 100% guarantee is that if you do get hooked, law school will go out the window. At some point after that, so will your friends, family, hopes, self-respect and everything else you value.

I hope you know i'm not trying to attack you here, I've just seen this happen time & time & time again to so many people, including myself, and I'm just telling you a short excerpt of the things I wish someone had told me at 19, a year before I started using (not that I'd have listened probably, but still). Heroin addiction isn't something that only happens to people who are stupid or undisciplined or incautious or short-sighted. It isn't something that is picked up only by people with no other ambitions, no hopes, no dreams, no feasible way of living a good life. It's not something that exclusively afflicts people without self-control or rationality or intelligence. This may be hard to believe, but there are scores and scores of heroin addicts who prior to heroin were the most disciplined, intelligent, conscientious & driven people you've ever met, and heroin bought them to their knees. 

We all think we're the special one who this story doesn't apply to. We all thought that our brains, objectivity, self-control, discipline or any other number of traits had made us the exceptions. Please, I implore you to just consider the fact that maybe despite being intelligent, rational and disciplined, you aren't one of the special, unique ones who will be able to keep a handle on H forever.Was the endocarditis from IV heroin? It's my understanding that its a pretty rare condition where vegetables grow in your heart but that it can be caused by injecting?? I can see why that would make you become a chipper. 

If that was the case, have you stopped injecting now altogether or do you still do it when you dabble in H? I have been fortunate enough to never have personally overdosed or even had a scare or complications other than the occasional abscess that cleared after antibiotics (the fact that we haven't had the fentanyl epidemic in the UK that has ravaged the US is to thank for that), but I feel that the fact that I've never even been close to any kind of scare like that makes it easier for me to justify relapsing/continuing using. 

In the US you literally have to consider the fact that you are risking death every time you IV because of fentanyl/fentanyl analogues and since short of buying fentanyl tests you can't tell if your shot will get you the high you want or just kill you then I feel as if that must make it a little harder to tell yourself that you'll get away with fucking around with H. Maybe if I was in the same situation with that morbid possibility hanging over me, I would have found it easier to stay away.I'm actually gonna be moving soon so I'll have to look all over again, but yeah if it was up to me I'd have a habit. Right now I'm using once a week/once every 5 days. And yeah man the waiting is killing me. For example I have money right now but I have to wait for things to come together so I can get againYes. It was from IV use. And it's not rare..its pretty common with IV users. Also not "vegetables", vegetation lol but I'm sure you meant that. The vegetation is actually caused by a bacteria that's on the skin and gets pushed in a vein or something then gets stuck in the heart. Was the 2nd or third time I got endocarditis but it was way more serious that time, soo like the 3rd hospitalization I've had from dope. I continued shooting after those first few times, and even while I was in the hospital for an internal abscess in my hip I was STILL shooting speedballs. Ridiculous.

Yepp I haven't injected one time since I've been out! I only boof or monkey water now. I've never had an overdose myself either luckily and have not gotten fentanyl (that I know of, p sure if I got it I'd know) through my 3 years of heavy using. Yes it's around in my area n shit but I just have a good connect that doesn't fuck with that.maybe you aren't giving yourself enough credit, man. When I was using, one time I took way too little H with me for a month-long trip to the other side of the UK, and ran out 2 weeks in. After being robbed 3 times trying to cold cop, I ended up taking a bus, 2 trains and another bus on a 7 1/2 hour journey just to get back to where I lived to score and then do the journey back. My point is, no distance could have kept me from scoring when I was determined, so maybe the reason you haven't been commuting regularly to score is because part of you doesn't want to get hooked again??hahaha, I realized that it wasn't literally vegetables growing in your heart but I did honestly think that the words vegetation and vegetables were interchangeable in that context. Only realized how silly it sounds now! 

good for you on putting the syringe down. I know how hard it is to go from injecting back to a less efficient ROA, and it takes a lot of self-control. 

Does your connect use himself? If he doesn't, then he could easily sell you fentanyl and not know that's what he was doing. Not every dealer is knowingly, actively fucking their customer base over by selling them fentanyl laced shit - a lot of them don't even have any ideas that's what they're doing. You run way less risk tho since you don't IV anymore so you have that going for you.Tbh it's because I don't have the money I wish the reason you gave was the actual reasonHahah yeah I thought so, didn't think you thought it was actually vegetables like carrots n shit. 

Thanks man, Kratom helps a lot and I just dont want to go back in the old cycle. Fuck. That. Also I like living, lol. 

Yess she does use, I know watchu mean though. Gotta be careful no matter what. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Precipitated Withdrawal, Content: So.. if you take sub, which is stronger than heroin, too soon after heroin, you get sick, ok.

But then you take fent after being on suboxone and get high.

Both have higher binding affinities than the other, yet one makes you sick and one gets you high. Why?, ups: 1, downs: 0Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist. Fentanyl is not.

Merry Christmas �Partial agonist/antagonist
Full agonistMust be why my dope got me high as fuck last night.  Yesterday was day 2 off BTH and 8mg Suboxone wasn't helping my withdrawal so I caved and smoked which gave me the relief I needed to finally pass out.  Going to try again today to just take Subs.  Wish me luck!I thought bupe has a higher binding affinity than most fent types? Or am I thinking of naltrexoneJust gotta suck it out. I’m in the same boat but I don’t have money or a way to get my dope @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Edibles and tolerance, Content: If you can enjoy weed and not get anxiety I highly suggest trying to mix in edibles with your DOC. Lately I’ve been taking 30-40mg of oxy throughout the morning and afternoon, and then late afternoon around 4 I’ll eat 100mg and be chillin until 10-12. And at that point I can either eat another edible or take 10-20mg and get through the night, with a couple bong rips throughout it. I was taking 100mg of oxy per day the last few weeks, and I only get RX’d 60mg per day. So I was running out too soon each month. Now I am able to make it last longer and I honestly enjoy taking my oxy so much more because I’m not just blowing through everything I have, but figuring out how to conserve comfortably. I work at a legal dispensary and I am able to get 100mg for $0.01 to $3.00 depending on the brand. So I have to say I’m lucky with that. But with how much some of your habits cost, I figured this could be an alternative to making it go much further than it normally would. Cheers and I hope you have a great night. I just took 20mg of oxy and I’m feeling pretty good. I want to take more but I need to bring my tolerance back down so I don’t run out. Share your edible usage if you want. Curious to see how others mix it in. Peace ✌🏻

Edit - I just wanted to add that my pain levels are definitely increased because the edibles barely do anything for that. Which is why I try to make the oxy last throughout the day as long as possible without being in horrible pain. Idk just trying to figure out how to not run out early and be comfortable. It’s tough when you experience chronic pain. I’m about to be 25, this is really what the rest of my life is going to be like? The thought I try to push as far away as I can every day., ups: 2, downs: 0Like the idea, next time i get my hands on some good edibles (live in illegal state) ill certainly try it out. I love weed but my tolly is too high to get much out of it alone. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Smoking subs??, Content: I heard some one talking about smoking subs didn’t say wether it was subutex or suboxone.. is this even possible?? How if possible would u even do it .. I can’t see it ever getting to the temp requirements for any effect, ups: 1, downs: 0Well there fkn idiotsU can smoke some tec but not suboxoneYeah smoking a sub strip off foil is a nightmare. Tried it once because my fucking up addict mind thought it would be a good idea. Just a total waste. Under the tongue is best for subs.Huge waste get real. It's a fucking maintenance med. Same with smoking oxy or hell smoking any pill is a horrible idea. If you want to get high skip Buprenorphine and get something elseThat’s what I was thinking lol.. as we know all substance need to reach a certain temp before they become a gas( smoke) and I don’t thing buprenorphine has a low temp . Not a chemistry guy but I’m not sure about this tale of smoking subsU can smoke subutex??? How do that on foil ??Yep, just like a roxy @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Help- No sleep while kicking 🦵🦃, Content: So I decided to use this holiday week to kick it cold turkey. I had a big 5 year habit- 2-3grams of high purity IV dope/day plus benzos, ketamine and ice. On day 6 and it feels as though the worst is behind me, but haven’t slept a fucking wink in 120 hours. Any suggestions? At what point does a lack of sleep become dangerous? Tried kratom, NyQuil, no access to benzo’s where I’m at. Thanks in advance 🙏, ups: 2, downs: 0I went cold turkey not too long ago and I only used Xanax to knock me out. Only took those the first 8-9 days though so I wouldn’t get dependent. I ended up going to the doctor at around day 17 or 18 because I thought I’d be in psychosis soon from no sleep. She gave me some meds that didn’t work of course but she said to come back if they didn’t work for me and she’d prescribe me Ambien. I would’ve done just that if my sleep hadn’t started to improve on it’s own at day 21. Oddly enough, several people on here told me to hold out until day 21 and it would get better. I didn’t believe them because who could be that precise? Sure as shit, it slowly improved after that. I’m at day 49 off everything now and I sleep completely normal. I even slept like 10 hours the other night. It gets better, I promise you. Your sleep cycle is the last thing to get back to normal - it was for me anyway.Gabapentin? That'll knock me out if I take enough. Excellent job dude! Proud of youKetamine helped me to cope with the shit at day time. And 2-4mg alprazolam for the night would help me catch some hours of sleep the first few days untill it gets better. Also i used about 600mg lyrica aday it helped with the symptoms aswell, but be carefull not just to  get addicted on another thing same with the benzos.

Lack of sleep can fell shitty but its not dangerous.You have access to cannabis?  Strong edibles helped me sleep while I kickedInteresting, thanks for the insight Tmac. I’m just surprised it’s taking this long to sleep because when I kicked last time I was sleeping on day 2, but I guess it can be different every time. So how long did you go without sleep? Was it after you stopped taking Xanax until day 21?Xanburgers only helped so much for me, gabapentin and clonidine were the real MVPs (and some Kratom, although the first two will work). Helped me kick a couple of times and other couple of times to subs.

It gets harder every time, though..Nyquil always made things worse for me. I don't jive well with diphenhydramineThanks for the suggestion my fellow bropiate. I will inquire with a physician about Gabapentin. And thank you for the encouragement, it’s really motivated meThanks brother, sounds like you were fucking stocked up for detox in a much bigger way than I am. I would kill for ketamine, but I had a daily IM k habit that I wanted to quit, same for alprazolam/diazepam . Pregbalin would be interesting, but no access at the moment, perhaps I will ask a docNot at the moment , but I can look around, thanks for suggestion dry heatYou could give melatonin a try, it’s legal, cheap and easy to get. I was skeptical but used it a couple times and that shit knocked me out. I wasn’t in withdrawals though so not sure if it would be as effective. Worth a try.Pretty much. Even when I was taking Xanax, at night I would sleep about 5-6 hours. When I stopped taking them, I would consistently sleep about 3-4 hours. Which is at least something, but having to get up and go to work on 4 hours of sleep for a few weeks was horrible. Everyone’s different, so maybe it won’t take as long for you. But I now put my trust in the 21 day rule lolThis! Exactly right, detoxing this time is so much harder than the last time I did and it’s not because my habit is bigger. I’m convinced you’re right and it just gets harder every time. I don’t have access to gaba or clonidine, but have carviderol , it’s also a blood pressure med, think it might help?Yea I drank 3 caps and it didn’t do shit besides take up my daily limit of 4 grams of acetaminophenGabapentin and clonidine are the only things that really keep me sane when detoxing. That and some Kratom, if I can get it. I then try and jump on Suboxone if I need to get back to work.My doctors are so against prescribing me gabapentin for WD.  Pisses me off.  So I get by with Kratom and clonidineYes good thinking my friend, I’ll give this a tryOh I see, I literally hadn’t slept a wink for 6 days, but per your wisdom I will also put my faith in 21 day rule � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxys & cigs, Content: So, I don’t smoke a lot, a pack will last me a few days to even a week sometimes. 

Also I don’t do pills that often tbh, I really don’t want to be dependent on them like I have been in the past for a short while. 

I can do either and it never makes me nauseous unless I smoke a lot or snort a LOT.

But it seems if I even do just a few pills (even as low as 20-40mg total) it makes me throw up almost guaranteed! Like I can do 100mg in a night fairly easily without feeling sick. 

It’s something about the combo that just makes me sick as a dog. Any tips to prevent the vomiting?, ups: 3, downs: 0I smoke a shit ton more when I'm on opes than I do normally.
It seems to increase the buzz, especially on the come up (or down, however you look at it)
But I know what you mean,it can turn my stomach a-bit sometimes. 
I never vomit from it though, but I do have quite a strong stomach drugs-wise.

Try having a can of ginger beer or some form of ginger when you start feeling the oxy onset, it calms my stomach amazingly.Me and my girlfriend noticed the same thing with vapes... nicotine in general seems to interact viscously with oxycodone and boosts nausea to a point where you wanna puke...In my day there was always a boot and rally mentality.Thanks I might try that. I usually have a good stomach for drugs also, pills and shrooms are the only thing that have made me throw up and that’s only if I’m really bingeing on a lot. And edibles lol.Damn, I've definitely threw up after a strong edible. Although I'm a heavy cannabis user, often smoking a joint every hour or two, i still underestimate the effects of THC and always assume I can handle more than I really can �Haha I felt the same way! I don’t smoke pot very often anymore, just don’t have a reliable plug right now. But I used to smoke a lot and the first time I tried some edibles it took me down a hole I couldn’t climb out of for a good couple hours!Yea man it does that, I stick with smoking mostly but I love a good weed milkshake, definitely tastes weird but the high is lovelyLmao I’ve never heard of a weed shake I might have to try that one day! I love milkshakes and I’ve only tried these like weed gummy’s that kinda just taste like sugar coated roaches�Just simmer some whole-fat milk with a low heat, make a kinda tea bag contraption with some bud or hash and cheese cloth, then just drop it in and simmer for an hour.

Some people add a little butter to help the THC bind to the fats but I never feel a lot of difference in the high.

Then leave it to cool and blend with some ice-cream (it's nice with blueberry or strawberry).That sounds pretty good! Think I could just use some wax or oil? Or would that taste a bit too funky? Never used concentrates for edibles so idk if that would taste better or worse.Never tried to be honest, the shakes taste quite funky anyway so I guess it couldn't hurt to try. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Tramadol urinalysis, Content: I am wondering if Tramadol pops on most urine tests? also wondering if Soma hits on a urinalysis.

This time is worse mabey higher tolerance or something. Main symptoms are legs back neck and skin are literally burning with an ache that does not subside unless I get in my parents spa which helps for mabey 45min and then comes right back. On top of all this shit my dad threw away my old suboxone and I told him I relapsed to get some and agreed to go to detox and hes got none!!! Fuck me. Luckily they were empathetic enough to give me 4 5s norcos and it made me feel 25%better for an hour. Fucking norcos dont do shit when I'm kicking serious shit.  So I'm abt to go to detox where they use suboxone tomorrow but in the mf mean time I have to endure this hell. And it truly is hell I cant think of a worst feeling then kicking opioids. I'm broke and no kratom or left overs I'm so fucked for the next 24 hrs. My girl is being supportive abt it but she did mention this will be the last time or she cant do it anymore it's really only been twice where I was on suboxone secretly the first time and more recently relapsed using alot of coke and the fent presses. I guess there isnt a question in this I guess support or advice wld be nice. I honestly wish i cld stay on suboxone for the rest of my life but my girl and parents do like that idea cuz it can constipate me but I was taking too much. I have never been sober more than 2 weeks in 12 years literally. I have no idea how to live free of drugs it's all I literally know and deeply woven into my Gene's as well which scares the shit out of me. I imagine seeing myself like these normies who go on road trips and dont smoke weed or do pills like how the fuck does anybody do that? I honestly feel like I will never get there and I will always need to be on something and it depresses me. Love love to my addicts out there, ups: 15, downs: 0Honestly when I was trying to kick a 130 mg a day of methadone cold turkey on my 5th I was so foggy on the head I couldn’t type or think straight.   I don’t know how you are able to type so well man.    

Hope you make it through 




My withdrawls were getting so bad on day 6 and 7 after it was all said it done I had mild ptsd for about a month.Super relate to the always wanting to be on something and sober life sounding boring as shit. I can’t imagine living without the rush of coping and getting high. 

 Luckily my wife feels the same way. We withdrawal together when we run out of plugs or money, and we use together for however long we can on whatever we can get. 

Good luck with everything, man, really. I hope it all works out for you.You have to decide what you want in life and do it. It won’t be easy. Anything worth it is never easy. Keep your head up man.Kick this shit and it will be the hardest thing you ever do. After that, you can do anything. You have to find a new purpose in your life because that girlfriend and her parents that love you? They'll be gone. Cash out while you can. I've lost everything because of my addiction. Don't let it happen to you.Keep it up bro i know the exact burn ur talking about. I had it on my back chest and stomach. Its fucking unreal. Ive never felt anything like the wd from fent. I was on day 3 this morning and had to give in i couldnt take it. And u have no idea what i have riding on this right now. Keep it up i wish i would of just kept going bc im back to the starting line again. Once u get to the detox ull be ok just hang in thereIt sounds weird but one thing that helped me get through my last kick was whip-its.

You only get relief for like 30 seconds at a time but that made the whole process just a little more bearable.Gotta get yourself some subs mateI have lots of 8mg subutex.. I don’t take them but use H daily . Smoking roughly 2/2.5g a day .. question is if I start to take subutex will I get withdrawals?? I have heard u only get with drawals from suboxone is this true ??Oh yea kicking done is the longest hardest kickDon’t fancy going cold turkey off 130ml of meth .. that’s roughShit i know... DONE is the worst WD. 

Glad to see more 504 cats around.God that sounds like me and my husband.  We share his meds bc we both have chronic pain and I can't get anything good for mine because I abused my prescription 1 time 5 years ago.  We are currently wd-ing and I'm making myself feel better by sharing in other people's misery.  I feel like a sick puppy.  We stuck w mediocre weed and coffee.  UghGive yourself 24 hours+ without opiates and then take them and you’ll be good.As others have stated 24-48 hours is a good rule of thumb, but every person is different, your metabilism could possibly be slower or faster than average. If you want to be 100% sure I would use [this](https://www.mdcalc.com/cows-score-opiate-withdrawal), its the exact same way treatment centers determine timing for subs. Just make sure you're absolutely honest with yourself about your symptoms and you shouldn't have any problems.You wont go into precipitated wd with subutex so take it whenever you feel wd starting. But make sure it truly is subutex and not suboxone otherwise you'll be in a world of hurt!That’s shitty that you can’t both get decent scripts. WDs suck but having someone you love next to you while you suffer makes it better.Yeah at the very least 24hrs. Try to wait 48-72, you will want to out a gun to your head if you get thrown into precipitated withdrawl, especially with a fairly big habit such as yours @@@@@@@@@@ Title: On suboxone for chronic pain, I'm high as a kite., Content: I was on fentanyl patches and hydrocodone, but switched to suboxone. They gave me 2 milligrams films that melt in ur mouth. Man things are strong as fuck, I was on 25mcg patches of fentanyl patches before and I thought I would not feel shit at all on subs, I stay high all day and night. Music is awesome on Subs and my pain is really low. I'm loving it, so glad I switched., ups: 16, downs: 0They definitely get you high.  Seen many accounts from people saying this.  Just be aware of long term use, as coming off of them is a much longer process than short acting opiates.  I guess that won’t be an issue if you plan to be on them for life though.Did nothing for my pain and I took 8mg but good for you man pain relief is the best high imoLucky you. Your tolerance must be a lot lower than you thought. Subs won’t get anyone with a moderate tolerance high- they just keep us out of withdrawal. 

Glad you got the relief you needed. Good luck.I'm really surprised you were on fentanyl and subutex gets you high. Heroin is my DOC, and even when my habit was *tiny* (had been using less than 6 months, .1 a day if that) and I was put on 8mg subutex a day I didn't feel anything much. I remember trying to get high off it by taking like 24mg and just feeling weirdly blunted but no pleasure at all, and then of course 2 days later when I tried to use H the block was still in full effect. I guess you're one of the lucky ones that gets the bupe high. I've heard of people with serious habits say bupe is almost like an upper for them, and I've sold pills to friends with no opioid tolerance and watched it fuck them up, but for me they don't do shit. They are absolutely fantastic for maintenance though, a godsend for the times I've had to quit and was trying to stay clean.Methodone better gheeI remember doing subs before u ever really fucked with opiates and I'd just be drooling nodded off my ass off 4mg. Just fucking gone. This was like a decade ago when they had the big chalky pills.yea it was i. pittsburgh pa. the dr there could prescibe that amountthats so weird. i was on 32 mg of subs a day and it didnt do anything for my muscular pain. i guess it depends on the type of pain.Damn lol I posted in here a couple weeks ago asking if subs could get me high and 5 people said no.way better. i loooove methadone. love it.Yeah, I get 2mg pills and I give about a quarter to relatively non-tolerant people, had them been high for DAYS off this shit.They gave me two boxes with 60 subs in them. A lot.It is more effective at lower doses (recreationally anyway), and there is a sort of ceiling effect (I was told that it occurs around 30mg, but that was also way before it went totally "mainstream").Holy shit that's a lotI mean everyBODY is different and all, but OP is the first person I've heard who could get high off subs after using something potent as hell like fetty on the regular... he is wasn't on the fent long enough to get a dependence or quit using it for 2 - 3 days before using bupe, otherwise the bupe would've triggered AWFUL precipitated w/d.

Anyway, if you're opiate naive yes subs/bupe get you high but for a day or 2 tops. Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect, more does absolutely nothing so once your body is used to it the only thing it does is prevent dope sickness, whether you take 8mg or 40mg.Take less at least for now. You are already close to the ceiling for those positive effects. If you need pain relief keep some powder dry.What? The ceiling is like 5-6, maybe 8mg.yea 30 seems to be right for the ceiling effect. im on methadone now and it works wonders for pain. makes sense though on the dose that im on72 mg. thats like 800mg of morphean convertedI've known several people on H who went on bupe and though it didn't get them high like heroin they said it was almost like taking a stimulant, with a positive energy boost, optimism etc. It's never worked like that for me but I have seen it, though it is surprising that OP was on fentanyl and feels the bupe. All I can think of is that fentanyl isn't exactly known for being euphoric, so maybe OP has built a tolerance to the sedation/pain-relief of opioids but not the euphoria since fentanyl provides very little and that's why the bupe is giving him a buzz??I definitely see/feel a difference between 4mg and 8mg, or even 8mg/16mg, etc. After a certain point you just aren't really changing anything by taking more.Yeah that's a pretty good guessthats weird that u say fentanyl isnt really known for its euphorie. i got out of the game right before fent showed up but i got my tonsils out and they fave me iv fent right after the surgery and ive never felt such euphoria in my life. super itchy face. hospital fent must be diff then compared to whats out on the street or web. funny thing is she shit me up and im like i dont feel anything so she gave me another shot...still nothing and gave me one more shot.

   everytime rhough i was rocked i just didnt say that so i could get more lmao. one thing i can say is the fent didnt have any legs on it. wore off aftern a couple of hours but. that rush was GODLY.That's interesting, I find it comes much faster. Never felt anything different the few times I've done something like go to 8.You're right, I wasn't being concise. What you were having was actual fentanyl, most of what heroin is being cut with on the streets today isn't actually fentanyl, it's analogues like carfentanil, orthofluorofentanil and a handful of others. These analogues are many, many times more potent than fentanyl itself (which is already extremely potent when compared to heroin) to the point where literally a few grains of the pure chemical is enough to OD on (thus the skyrocketing overdose rate). This potency unfortunately applies to sedation and respiratory depression but *not* to euphoria, pleasure, warmth or any of the other positive effects that people use H for.  

As a result there are thousands of reports of people snorting/shooting up etc and feeling totally fucked up and nodding their ass off but reporting it as feeling "cold", "empty" and devoid of any mood lift, let alone euphoria. It stops their withdrawal, but doesn't provide the bliss that they're looking for. They're addicts though so it's not like they can stop taking it just because all the dealers are selling carfentanil laced shit, so they keep taking it so as not to get sick. 

The kicker is is that if this goes on for long enough (especially if they're upping the dose in a futile attempt to get the euphoria H used to give them from a mixture that consists of 95% carfentanil to 5% H), the potency of carfentanil and its far stronger binding to the opioid receptors means that if their dealer gets their shit together or they find a new dealer that's actually selling heroin, they can't get high off it. They can't even get well from it. Their tolerance has skyrocketed, leaving them dependent on a substance they don't even enjoy and unable to derive any pleasure from the drug they were after in the first place. These people are the lucky ones. The unlucky ones have overdosed and died. 

It's an awful situation, and IMO the worst thing to happen to users & the illicit opiate market since  drug prohibition itself. Since colloquially people refer to the various fentanyl analogues as just fentanyl I didn't specify that I was referring to the analogues rather than just plain fentanyl, which to my knowledge isn't widely used as a cut to H when compared to the cheaper, more potent and shittier analogues. I have heard of many people enjoying the high from fentanyl - not so much people with heroin habits (I've always heard that people on H would always choose H over fentanyl), but it doesn't surprise me too much. You're totally right though and I was implying the wrong thing when I said that fentanyl had no euphoria - it's the analogues I meant.thanks for all of the information. that was very informative!! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Am I okay to sleep?, Content: I know this is a stupid question but I took 80mg of oxy on Friday, haven’t been able to re up since so today (Sunday at like 4pm) I took a 8mg sub and ripped it in half. 

Long story short I’m like actually nodding and feeling like the days I’d be on 250mgs of oxy 

Can subs be that strong???? Can it slow my heart down? I’m also still experiencing withdrawal issues like the bathroom so forth but I’m still nodding, ups: 3, downs: 0You are fine. Subs have an incredibly high LOD. Its damned near impossible to die from respiratory depression off of subs, unless you are a toddler or a small child or maybe even an old womanHe’s right, you will be fineIm a she lol @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Do you guys have any stories about scoring drugs for unbelievable cheap prices?, Content: So, here's mine. In 2018, I knew a dude who used to sell me boxes full of hospital-grade fentanyl amps for less than R$80,00 (20 dolars) each box. Those were boxes who were meant to be sold to hospitals. I don't know how the guy got it, he maybe worked in the very factory where those were produced, but that's a ridiculous price. Each box countained 50 vials of fentanyl citrate! It was such an absurdly cheap price. To give you guys an idea, each individual vial was worth about R$32,00 (that is, 7 to 8 dolars) in the black market. And again, each box countained 50 of them! I used to sell each vial for RS32,00 to a businessman who suffered from chronic pain and used to profit so much. Each 10ml ampoule = 78,5mcg/ml of fentanyl citrate, equivalent to 50,0mcg/ ml of fentanyl base.

I myself am an opioid addict, but am alergic to fent. I had awful reactions shooting those vials. And to be honest, I prefer so much more my IV morphine, heroin, and my oxys over the fentanyl. Yeah, the rush was alright, but the high was all about passing out and waking up one hour later with the drug already wearing off some moments later. You need a shot every two hours when you use this, because it has such a short duration. Very "synthetic" and inferior euphoria and such a short duration. But man, do I miss the profit I used to make selling those damn things. One day that guy just disappeared. Have no idea what happened to him., ups: 16, downs: 0Wow that sounds like an incredible score! What a treat it would be to have a come up like that to fund your habit.

The best thing I personally ever had going, was a once a month pick up from a lady with brain cancer.

110 Count of V 48 11 Oxycodone 15MG IR. 

I still couldn’t believe the first time her son quoted me $3 a pill, this is back when Roxie 30mg were $20 a pill. I thought I had hit the fucking lottery �1998 was the first time I encountered a Oxy80, I bought 5 pills for $30, the old man didn't know what they were.i used to get hydromorphone for 50 cents per mg..  those were the days �From 2000 up until 2015 I got 90 diludid 4mgs for 1 dollar apiece every 10 days.  The guy thought since they were only 4mg they couldn't be any good.  Same guy also sold me 80mg oxy's for $10 apiece going up to $20 in 2010 I got 90 a month from him.  He was my stepbrother he knew next to noone and was very reclusive.  He also got 360 perc 10's a month which was all he took.  It was a good 15 year run until he got kicked off pain management.  The last 4 years have been tough I'm a member of the local methadone clinic nowadays.  I couldn't afford normal street prices after being spoiled like that.Guy gave me his whole script of ritalin in high school once cause he wanted me to think he was cool (he is a good dude, just a bit down on himself and wanted people to like him, still friends now) and another guy in high school crashed his motorcycle into a tree and didn't like the codiene they gave him. I was at his house and said howany for $20, he threw me the whole bottle. Good day for a 17yoUsed to bulk buy oxy cdn 80s (real ones) and would pay 10 piece and they were selling for 40 or 50 to people who didn’t know or you didn’t wanna sell to lol. Now I hear they are like a dollar a mg here it’s stupid. Some guy though who didn’t know anything about anything sold me a bottle of 120 Xanax bars and 90 Hydromorphcontin 30mg for 300 lol10 € g of opiumdamn fent citrate is nice. used to get fent citrate powder.  kicked my ass. anyeay my buddy who used to sell K would give me 30$ grams. sometimes 4gs for 90. too bad he passed away. he was an amazing person.One of my best buds has a pharmacist friend. He steals bottles at his family owned pharmacy and fudges numbers/orders more to cover up to sell to friends.

I get oxyneo for $0.09/mg, IR oxy for $0.38/mg and hydromorphone for $0.50/mg


Just got 1.5g of hydromorphone delivered today. Not bad.



Adding to this I just remembered about 10 years ago I met this guy and became friends with him. He had a script for clonazepam and one for 5mg ir dexedrine. He would get 200 a month of each and give me the both whole bottles for 20 bucks. He ended up killing himself about 6 months after I met him. If he didnt I'm sure my life would have taken a different path i was getting pretty damn addicted.The comments make me realize how expensive this shit is in us. In Europe it’s easy to get a box of 28 x 80mg oxy for £140Got a bottle of hydro 10-325(if I recall right) from a condo I rented. Was in a single locked pantry in the condo, but the lock was easily jimmied and boom.I had the joy of experiencing a rare occurrence for me (and for many, I'd imagine). 

Upon leaving my Scoot pad this A.M., I was rather surprised by a call from what the hippity hopper youngsters around here call the "pog", aka one of the round, poker chips emblazoned with a picture of one of those grody Ren & Stimpy concept characters and bugs known from the myriad beloved RAID ® commercials.

Anywho, since the holidays made plentiful pilgrim style progress in some bank closure butt fuckin', I was fortunate enough to score a small front from this relatively new to me dboy to help heal me bum until moneychecks.

Now, excited as I was to get the bag floated and build some trust along the way, it honestly wasn't enough to get me by, even if rationed at a stage zero, which is where I'm dead and not using opioids at all. So, being pretty broke and not wanting the front to hinder a purchase, I slide across town to old reliable (who's quality has taken an unfortunate and uncharacteristic dip in quality) for dope that will hopefully see me through this home stretch. Nerp, not even close... Then the phone rings, bringing us full circle, and some early morning, out of the ordinary interaction suddenly blooms into the stiff and majestic opi-bone that could only arise when proffered the sacred, at times damning, front on top of front action. Wahoo, I did say.

And I did fap. Fapped till done.Nothing too crazy (except for prescriptions or darkweb prices GODDAMN) 
10dkk (1.5$) for 7 10’mg actavis oxy’sapparently afghan heroin is 10 dollars a gram on the DNM now.here in the Netherlands u can buy 1gr pure #3 afgan for 15euro and 100gr for 1000 euros still going today

ghb and speed hella cheap also but i ddont fuck anymore with those anymoreI used to get boxes of prop from SA for £17k .. would make it into 0.8 wraps and sell them for £60 each that’s £72k return . Was a nice earner as I was doing almost 1 box a week .. done that for 2.5 years .sadly the LE caught up with me and I got 4 years ( served 2) but hey it was some party while it lasted . Some crazy stories partying with celebs going 5* everywhere. Getting called at 4am to go to parties full af A listers .. WOW I HAVE HAD A MAD LIFE LOLMexico and south central LA back in college. Plus the finding older people w bottles of pills that have no idea the price. Midwest when I was young (b4 Molly was a common thing) Epills were $25/30....met my buddy Pacific northwest a JAR FOR $650.....$6.50/PILL...fucking blew me awayProper coke 90+% which was a rare thing as most people jump on it where as I got the best of gear and had the ethos that Quality product means good customers.. dam I was rightHow much difference is there between grade #3 and #4 ?? Also what about tar ?? What do people think is best.. in uk we don’t get fenNever even heard about heroin in Brazil. How expensive it is?Does my 3.5 grams of morphine each month for $25 count?Great score on the Fent: few things come to mind: 700 gram bricks of double lion brand China White for $20,000 and how it all started for me (and many of you I’d imagine) 80mg old school OCs for $20 each back in 2009I had this interaction with a gas station cashier this afternoon:

C: *so quiet I can barely hear* Yo dog

M: .....what?

C: You smoke weed?

M: Yeah?

C: You want some?

M: Dude I'm putting $4.60 in my gas tank, I'm broke

C: Don't worry man I got you, just go pump your gas

I set the pump up and within a minute this dude walks out, hands me 2 grams of weed, and says "if you like it...I'm here like all the time." On top of that after he went inside and the gas pump was finished I noticed he threw an extra $5.40 on the pump without even saying a word about it.Lived in FL during the opiod boom of 2000s. Roxy 30s for $8, original OC 80s for $30. Hydro 10 for $2 and I had a guy who got 100 yellow Xanax bars a month. He told me he took quaaludes by the handful in the 70s and these bars weren't shit. For 8 a months he traded me 100 yellow buses for a zip of mids that cost me $100.. If you lived in FL late 90s to 2006 or so you know what I'm talking about. Easier to get pills than weed. And then the pill mills everywhere. $200 for MTI and $150 cash every month and you walked out with 120 Roxy 30s and 120 Xanax bars.And about a month ago I dude at my work gave me 23 perc 10s for $20Back when you could order fentanyl from almost any Chinese chemical company online. 10 grams of fentanyl hcl for $800. Of course that price didn’t last long and went to $500-$800 a gram.Rubbed my dick on the plugs ole lady for percDamn, I'm assuming she didn't last long?Yeah the cancer people are the best. They just want a friend in their last days.Hohohooo! Did you get all hopped up on the hop and proceed to do 90s things the whole day?I miss 15 dollar hydromorphcontin 24mg or 6 for 100 30mgOh, I love it when people don't know what they have, and I'm coming to take that from 'em. Nowhere near as good as yours, but I once was supposedly buying a 30ct bottle of 10mg hydrocodone as a teenager, and the guy wanted like 30 bucks, and upon realizing they were 5mg, I got 15 back.Wish good opium was around. It's not even very easy to get picking onions.[deleted]Uhhhhhh..... OkYou might have thought you wrote this eloquently but no one here can understand what the fuck you just saidr u sure? Heroin that cheap sounds like fentI got 0.8 of #3 for £11 so about $12.50 .What's prop?lol no one paid 30 dollars for e pillsUhh, it really depends where you are, who it's from, quality...

Why would you want it?Dude this is not allowed. Why fucking risk this and not just DM him without telling everyone on the sub what you're doing? It makes you seem like a lazy idiot. If you wrote in a comment 'message me in DM' I would only do that if I wanted to scam you. I don't understand why you break the rules for something so easy tk avoid.Right-o, friend. But let's not dwell on my bored ramblings and focus in on the real, errr... treasure to be found in this thread... Chock full!Thank you for confirming my suspicions...that whole post had like WTF?   LollolCan confirm, single grams are like $15 and you can grab 10 for $120 shipped from some people.it's uncut, from NLnicefrom the US, but I just found out it's "proper cocaine". really high purity like 85%+. 

please correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not from the other side of the pond.Yah I'm lying about something like that u retard. This is 16 years ago in a Midwestern city NOT close to any major cities. Mind your business if you're going to be a hater for no reason.Yes, they are very sick. You are correct.Yeah mate, the lower mainland to be specificYeah, basically a non-addicts/hippies opiate, I'd see it as. If I wasn't on buprenorphine, and had the chance, I'd absolutely source a few G's of opium to vaporize with friends as a treat, do things like smoke it with hashish...puff it on psychs.I love it for just a chill session with some friends.I actually like it prob because it was the first opiate I tried anyways my favorite roa is oralIf u know i am that lazy,
Do u think i read “rules” ?
But thanks, now i know.
Deleted the comment.
And probably wont trust.
But you seriously think i trust a guy on the internet? I mean i wrote that just for seeing how the scam goes. I would never ever proceed.

Take me for a guy who didnt know about this rule, fair, but please dont take me for a fool bruh.ohYea but arent inbound packages from Netherlands highly scrutinized by customs?so you were just ripping off ya friends that's funfigured.. don’t think they got hydromorphcontin in the us... not that it’s a bad thing anyways.. they suck compared to ir dillysYou’re absolutely a foolU r an idiot bro. That was the GOING rate back then in THIS AREA OF THE US at that TIME period. Go fuck yourself dumbass.way better than dillies. You just crush the beads lol it’s easyi know, just a bitch compared to ir hydro @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Bad morphine experience, Content: This is a follow up to my last post- 

I found some expired (prescribed 2006, take by 2008) 30mg morphine sulfate immediate release pills, and after extensive research decided to take one. I figured the worst that would happen is I wouldn't feel anything due to them degrading.

After about 40 minutes I started to feel weird, felt a bit out of it but also really nauseous. I threw up everything in my stomach and then some. I then spent the next hour and a half in excruciating pain, while also kinda high. 

I felt super out of it and loopy, but also like I had a hot ball of lead in my stomach and shooting pains up my back. 

I found a position to lay in that made the pain go away a tiny bit and laid there until I fell asleep.

Did my body just have a bad reaction or was it because the morphine was expired- what do y'all think?, ups: 1, downs: 0not the first time i’ve heard of this kind of experience with morphine. one day a couple of friends of mine took some(new morphs) and they just ended up feeling like shit/wanting to vomit the entire time til they eventually did.IMO I think you just had a bad reaction to the morphine itself, Back in 2016 I did quite a few MS contin 30mg and Codeine Contin 50mg that had expired in the late 90's or very early 2000's. They both seemed to hit perfectly fine but it's important to note that I already had a tolerance to opioids at the time. 

Some people are just more sensitive to opioids than others, often to oral morphine in particular. 30mg was likely just too much for you especially if you have little to no tolerance. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Need a navigator to Detox!, Content: Hello my fellow bangers, smokers, snifters, and boofers! Can anyone lend me some advice? I’m about to come off a 6 week habit of smoking 2-4 dime bags BTH a day. Unfortunately I bartend at a nice restaurant and with it being the holiday season am working 5-6 days a week.  My next shift is in 60 hours! This is my first true stint with opiates and withdrawal so I don’t have any personal idea of what to expect or how to manage 

I have at my disposal:
2 dime bags left (for weening maybe?
.5 grams of crystal 
300mg Tranadol
Both green and red Kratom
A bottle of 50mg hydroxyzine 

Any idea or personal experience on how to map this out and maintain/work through this detox??, ups: 1, downs: 0Watch this video . https://youtu.be/40H92hBhzgUYou definitely have every thing u need, Iv gotten back on h about 4 times doing it every day for 2-4 months and once I get tired I'll keep a mix on the side to take like 1 small line before work but mostly just do the red kratom and meth, I'll do like h one day, then one day of kratom/meth, then do tar for a day, then two days kratom/meth, then a lil h, then 3 days kratom/meth and just kinda taper down from kratom after those three days and usually the only withdrawal symptoms I have are runny nose and cold chills, if I ever gotta do double shifts I might do a lil line before work, but only if I feel like I really need too, basically I just sub the tar for meth then get off the meth, heroin withdrawls suck more because there physical, while meth seems a lot more mental. Who knows hopefully it works for you, just gotta see what you feel like and know what you really want, one of the hardest things about me quitting is I just get tired of it, I don't feel like its neccesarily destroying my life or anything so after a while I'm like fuck it why not do a lil bit? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Vivitrol is a pain in the ass., Content: I was a long time, daily opiate user who has been through several rehabs, sober houses, bullshit 12 step programs, and on and on.  Have been on Vivitrol for six months now.  I did not go on the shot for me or for my "recovery".  I did it because my family and girlfriend could use a break from worrying, and I made no bones about my distaste for being on it.  They are fully aware that I'm only doing it because I want them to get some sleep at night.  That being said...

I chipped here and there for the past couple years without becoming dependent, and I have complete confidence in my ability to have a one-off dose every couple months or so.  I have been through the hell of years of dependence, and that life is a few years behind me now.  I refuse to be a junkie again.  Refuse.  Total abstinence, however, is not in my game plan for the rest of my life. 

I miss being able to grab a small quantity of dope every once in a blue moon, enjoy it for a day or two, and put it down for a long while.  I've done that more times than I can count.  I'm at about week 3 since my last Vivitrol shot, and I'm certainly planning and plotting right now.  I'm thinking about grabbing some later this week.  Anyone here have experience with Vivitrol and getting high toward the end of the shot?  I'm sure it won't hit me as hard as it would without the antagonist, but surely it would do something, no?  Or should I push my next appointment back a week?, ups: 1, downs: 0five years ago, i had a naltrexone implant that stopped me feeling the effects of opiates for about eight months

...WORST EIGHT MONTHS OF MY LIFE!

i noticed that for the last few weeks of the implant i was getting a small bit of the opiate's benefit, and bigger doses certainly helped, but cost a shitload more and also increased the risks of overdose

perhaps put the next shot off a coupla weeks and try having some gear about five weeks after your last one?My buddy used to get the shot, n he'd pickup n use on like the 27th, 28th day. I'd prob push ur next app back so u can at least enjoy it.. hope this helpsJust be careful if you push back your shot. My doc never warned me about up-regulation of receptors from it and when I first used after my last time being on it 9 months. 1/4 or less of a $5 bag of fentadope had me puking / nodding my ass off.  If I woulda even tried to do 1/2 the bag I’m sure I woulda OD’ed.  Start smallAnd shoots up your tolerance trying to breakthrough the shot.   Just think if you just wait till it clears your tolerance would be so low and therefore cheap spendingThanks, that's probably the best way to go about it.  I'll bide my time for a little bit.  I'll continue on the shot for a little while longer for my loved ones' sake, but no way am I staying on it for more than a year.  Hopefully I can postpone the next appointment without too much friction.  Appreciated!Thanks, this is good advice.  No sense in dropping $100 for a $20 high, if that.  I remember the bad old days when I'd take sub because I didn't think I'd score later in the day, then I'd somehow get a front or come up on some cash.  Race to the dope house, shoot a ton of dope just to feel something .  No bueno.  I'll be waiting another week or two for this chemical chaperone to piss off.I'd expect to have no tolerance and would definitely start small, but wow.  Thanks for the heads up.  So I would be more sensitive to it than I would even if I hadn't used anything and hadn't been on the shot?Yes lol.  It’s pretty cool actually I was getting high as hell off $5 a dayWell damn, that gives me something to really look forward to!  Lol thanks again. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: My life is pretty much over, Content: Not sure why im even writing this. Maybe it'll serve as a warning to others. 2 summers ago i got out of rehab and was in iop for 7 months. Relapsed then went from using once a month which led to everyday past 2.5 months. I was only using a bag or 2 but had no idea it was fent dope until i took a drug test recently. 

I am getting married in aruba in 2 months. My fiance who never did a drug in her life kept finding my stuff and decided to try it. She got pulled in too. Its all my fault tho. I just didnt think it would get to this point stupidly. Past 2 weekend we tried to detox at home. Only making it 2 and then 3 days. The wd from fent dope is unreal idk how ppl do it.

Now we either have to try 1 more time to ride it out starting tm and will have to call out of work all week. But then if we cave we will be so fucked. If her parents find out id never be able to face them again. My parents would be upset but they already know of my issue so it wouldnt be a huge surprise. But omg if her parents find out it will be so horrible.

I havent said anything to mine bc i will get sent to detox and i cant say no bc i work for them and they will just cut off my money until i go. But i cant just leave my fiance here to face this alone bc she needs someone here with her. We are both literally crying in disbelief and having no answers.

We tried kratom and lope but by day 3 its just fucking unbearable. If we try again starting tm im hoping that our combined 5 days of detox in the past week may not set us vack to square one but idk. Im at a complete loss and tbh im literally contemplating suicide at this point. Our wedding cannot be called off, everyone paid a lot of money to go. We have about 2 months to get off this shit and we need to asap but im losing hope. My parents think i have the flu right now bc i needed to buy some time but now im going back to day 1 so no clue how long it will take now if i can by some miracle even ride it out.

This is such a hopeless situation. Idk how i never encounter fentdope but the wd is just impossible idk how ppl do it and i was doing such a low amount i had no idea how fucked we'd be. And if our parents find out it will be so himiliating and i cant leave her on her own to fight this herself while i get help. At this point i dont even know if a detox can help me bc i heard subs dont work for this shit. Had no idea. I cant think of a worse situation to be in and its all my fucking fault. I pray to god we somehow make it out of this. Please if ur clean and thinking about using any of this shit dont risk it its truly not worth it. I really am so hopeless and dont know what to do..., ups: 10, downs: 0Have you seen a doctor / clinic about some form of medical assistance such as subutex/suboxone? I feel like your situation is ideal for that. Otherwise if that’s not possible you have two weeks to taper down to a manageable dose then two more weeks to taper with Kratom. What was your starting habit and starting dose of Kratom. A lot of people fuck up how to do it by not taking enough or by taking it the wrong way.

Seriously, you’ve got to pull yourself together and figure this out. It’s not the end of the world.Have you thought about methadone in lieu of subs?Have you tried Suboxone?Brother just go to a methadone clinic all of your problems will be solved.  You'll feel great in a week.  Get to a stable dose through your weeding and honeymoon then start a slow taper.  I have been in almost your exact situation I promise you it will make you and your girls lifes so much better.The wedding doesn't matter at this point. You should probably get help separately and work on yourselves as individuals. Too hard trying to get better while holding up each other. You're putting more pressure on yourselves. Bottom line this is about saving your lives!! Good luck. Seek suboxone or whatever works. Disappointing your family isn't the end of the world and isn't the big picture here.What kind of work you do? Can you and your girl both just roll out for a week and go to detox...her parents don't need to know..just tell them your going somewhere, like away for a few days...OK you need to chill the fuck out dude holy crap you're being dramatic. Have you guys thought about going to a medical detox or is that not possible?Get yourself some diazepam/Valium it has a long half life perfect for wd and the wd from it are nothing in comparison to dope man and please don't commit suicide man your loved you can beat this demon if other humans have then You can too and I'm talking with expertise in the subject as I was in your position but I know it's different for everyone but YOU CAN DO THIS. Much love. The community loves you also.Dude I’m serious I did the exact same thing you’re thinking of doing and got clean off fent. You have to make it through the first 2 days and then on day 3 you get high and skip the nonstop throwing up and general unbearable nature of day 3. If you don’t get high tomorrow you’ll probably still feel fine until tomorrow night, and even then, it won’t be as bad. Tomorrow night kratom mixed with hot water, lemon juice and sugar should actually get rid of your symptoms unlike the first 2 days where it barely does anything noticeable. I got high on day 6 too just bc I knew I could (I was doing this in preparation for a drug test) but you probably won’t need to.

Don’t beat yourself up over this, but don’t use it as a reason to give up completely. I swear it works so much better if you do it this way, doing it all in one stretch sucks so much more than it has to.I get that..i really do. Ok..for your situation seek MAT for both of you. You have time to do this successfully. Your life isn't over so focus on one thing at a time. You both can do this. I'm glad to listen anytime. Take care and knock off the negative talk. No time for that. Focus on your well being and go from there.It’s more about getting away from ur usual routine .. as we know the first thing u do with a habit is wake up and take a charge just cause u think it make life ok .. getting away from that mind set is critical..I used ~120mg loperamide a day and ~15g kratom every 3-4 hours when i quit. Fwiw, it can be done. Hard as it seems now.Not dosing kratom enough you need to be taking much more!!! Higher dose would probably even make you feel slightly itchy with the Bali stains.. seriously with such a low tolerance you shouldn’t feel this way until you’re doing a half to a g a day..If you're concerned about precipitated withdrawal, you could try the Burmese method where you microdose buprenorphine and slowly increase that while slowly decreasing your regular opioid dose.

Here's a link to the article on how to do it.  It's a journal article, but explains pretty straightforwardly how to do it.  Good luck, I would recommend talking with your doctor about what's going on.  They can help you, and it's pretty common these days for providers to prescribe Suboxone.

https://www.bcpharmacy.ca/news/microdosing-buprenorphine-induction-bernese-method

Also, just getting off of the dope is one thing, but learning how to heal while also entering into a legally binding agreement is another.  I would definitely think about counseling at the very least, and would suggest thinking about whether postponing your wedding for health reasons might not be a bad idea.  You only get one shot at this.

Much loveThings actually get a lot better day 4 ...getting to that point is rough thoughYes, fent withdrawls are typically a lot more intense but shorter time wise 4-5 days you’ll be out of the woods with the physical part...you will still have to conquer constantly thinking about it for a few weeks also the insomnia drags out but just keep your mind set on it will be over with quickly. Good luck manMethadone is your best friend right now. There is no risk of precipitated withdrawal and you can pretty much bypass acute withdrawal symptoms with methadone. 

Take a dose that makes you feel normal -- not high, just normal. Take that dose for 5 days, then stop.

That's it.

You can't get addicted to methadone in such a short time. And you won't have acute withdrawal symptoms.Try to get some gabapentin or pregabalin(lyrica) Not sure how it works, but honestly, it kicks WDs ass. Not sure how easy its gonna be for you to get, but I buy it over the counter here in China. Lyrica is best. I get 50mg capsules, usually take them all at once (8) at night time on day 2/3.Methadone. Get Methadone. I swear by it. The sooner you start the more likely the clinic will let you carry doses for your wedding. Bupe is hard to figure out when it comes to fenty presses. The half life is short but it still is hard to figure out when to take it. Methadone is the best bet if it’s an option.I know it’s expensive but the OPMS Gold Kratom Capsules really helped me. Don’t get me wrong you’ll obv miss the high but it makes it bearableThe thought of the wedding not happening as planned truly sucks.  But the thought of you two not getting clean, and healthy, and in a better frame of mind is far worse.  It broke my heart to tell my husband of 4 years what I had become.  Not to mention all our friends and family.  That was honestly my point of coming clean... telling them what they all already knew/suspected/or made complete sense in hindsight.  You will get though this but professional help is probably your best path.  Trust that they all love you and just want you to be happy again.  You have the desire, just need the tools and support system.Why are you stressed about needing to get clean for the wedding? Sounds like you guys just need to hide your shit better. Me and my gf have been using together for years and haven’t had any problems. Also if your parents have that much control over your life and you can’t just tell them to fuck off, I would suggest you hold off on big shit like marriage until you’re a more independent adult.How are you doing today?If you’d like a quick fix, go to a suboxone doctor (you for sure have a provider in your area, just go to the drug website and there should be a search bar for providers). They will make you feel completely normal. I’ve been off oxys for 72 days and 48 days off subs. I didn’t taper properly from the subs, so I basically cold turkeyed it after I ran out of the subs. I 100% would’ve relapsed at around day 3 if I didn’t have Xanax for that first 8-9 days. It was the only thing that helped me. If you go this route, know that it does get better and, trust me, if I could do it, y’all can too. My patience and self control is always at 0% lol. I refused to go to a detox or doctor though, so if that’s an option for you, then do that.I'm from your area...if you need any recommendations of places or programs to help message me....I had many years and relapsed over a year ago...just hit a year clean again beginning of November....Im just going to have to give this one more shot ct b4 the absolute catostrophy of breaking the news to our families. I dont even care at this point how her parents look at me i just want her to get out of this ok. She never did a drug in her lifs until 30 yrs old and it was bc of me. She didnt deserve this and i feel so bad. I just feel like my body is so beat the fuck up from detoxing 2 weekends in a row. Its roughI see why you have no hope but i doIts just defeating when u make it 48 hrs and 72 hrs and throw in the towel. Especially with whats on the line. We both were only using about 0.1-0.2 a day. Thats why i cant believe how bad the withdrawal gets after 48 hrs. And my kratom does was about 5 grams every 6 hrs. Plus about 20mg of immodium a day. I have a few subs but im scared to even mess with them bc i read so many horror stories about pwd with fentdope and i was already sensitive enough with pwd with reg dope. Worst case we just have to tell our parents and get this figured out but im going to try to ride it out one more time. I just hope using a little bit today doesnt put me back at square fucking oneYea i just dont know if the starting doses they give will be enough to make me ok. And i dont want to be on mat after detoxSuboxone helped me get off doing 1.5 grams of fent a daySuboxone don’t really work for me I have to use methodone gheeGreat advice!Very true but this is her dream wedding and everyone spent so much money for this to happen. We still have 2 months to figure this all out but realistically if we dont do this this week my family will find out regardless which is ok idc. I just dont want her family to hate me and i know she is so upset about if her family finding out. Its a legit nightmare and i cant think about anything else. I think she can ct it bc shes only done opiates for a very short time where i am on off for 10 yrs. Im going to try to stick it out. If not we will just have to come clean and hope our families take it ok and both get professional help. Never felt so low in my life. Please keep me and her in ur prayers bc i really need it very very badI know im prob being a little dramatic i can get real negative sometimes. Just sucks bc this time last yr i was sober and everything was great and i turned things into a nightmare situation. I dont want my future in laws knowing im a heroin addict and worse i got their daughter hook on the stuff. Yea its possible we can go and thats our best option. Im prob going to tell her we just have to just come out and say what happened and get help even if it is extremely embarrassing and sucks really bad. Both of us work for family companies thats why we can't do anything without them knowing whats up. All i know is whatever we do we have to do it now and not put it off any longer or itll just make shit worse than it is nowThank you i appreciate itWere u on fent dope? And how much were u taking?Do u know this from experience with fent dope?Horrible parents think i have the flu. My finace took the week of work. We finally realized we need help to get thru this so were going to tell my family tm morning and go from there. Shes so upset bc shes never done any drugs b4 these past cpl months and shes afraid what my family will think. Im just upset bc my parents will be pretty disappointed but is what it is. Thanks for asking thoThats awesome man. Do u have any experience with fentdope?I’m willing to bet that you two are feeding off each other’s misery during withdrawal making them worse than they actually are.. That’s a relatively small dose, tmm. As to the subs, take them as instructed and you’ll be fine.You need to really up your kratom dose if your using it for fent WD I'm talking like 40 grams a day and then you will taper from that.And please dont kill yourself my friend that's giving in, why make life pointless by ending it over this.Get methadone!!!!Bro those are rookie numbers. Back when I was using and in WDs I'd be dosing 80mg lope 2x a day and it worked pretty well for me (just don't do it long term)

And the people that use kratom reccomend doses of 15 grams multiple times per day. 

I can say without a shadow of a doubt that if your WDs are as bad as you say, the 80mg lope doses will def help.IMO the subs should be the next thing you try. I've always taken 8mg the first day sick and 4mg the 2nd or 3rd day (if i can make it to the 3rd day). Here's my logic (take this with a grain of salt, I'm no doctor): Buprenorphine is only a partial opioid agonist, so when you take it, I think you're still moving forward in your detox. However it is possible to trade one addiction for the other if you take enough fora long enough period, which is why I take so little. Everytime I've used this method my withdrawals were more tolerable than usual, and I was using a lot more than that. 

As for when to take it, everyone is different (every treatment center I've been to was reluctant to give me any before 24 hours even though I'm always in severe WDs by 16 hours), it comes down to your metabolism. If you use [this](https://www.mdcalc.com/cows-score-opiate-withdrawal) I don't think you should have any issues. Make sure she tests you and you test her, though, some people have trouble with exaggerating when testing themselves.That’s why you use the first few days until your dose is high enough to deal with...You’re talking about suicide but you haven’t even gone 100% actually trying to get off the dope. You used kratom and lope? What about subs, methadone, clonidine, benzos, cannabis, hot baths, acupuncture, massage, beta blockers, exercise, etc.?I used for the first little while I was on it. Most clinics won't kick you out for use unless it is totally abhorrent. Explain your situation to the staff and start from there. At my first clinic, I started on 25mg, went up 5mg a day to 50mg, then 10 a day from there (to 90). Even 25 will help immensely, but regardless, inside of a month you will both be stable.You don't have to be on MAT. Just don't go. You can get methadone at a clinic or you can get it the same way you get any other drug. It will definitely help.Yeah dude you need to bite the bullet and go to a clinic and either get methadone or subs. By the end of the first week you should be good. They start at 30mg which will help maybe 50% but it keeps building and by week one you should be quite comfortable. 
Like the others said give it a try. I lost so many jobs due to being sick and onlynwish I had not waited as long as I did to just hit the clinic. No more withdrawals again. Figure it out if you want it long term after the wedding. They give travel bottlesEverything you put before your addiction you will lose. #1 tipYea my life def isnt over by any means but it really is an absolute nightmare situation that is prob going to cause a lot of issues between our families which sucksabout .8-1.5g a day, idk for sure if tge H was cut with fent, but i was also using fent pressed pills a lot, the first two weeks i was incapacitated by w/d even with kratom and loperamide, but after that i was at least able to work. I still take kratom daily. Its a never ending battle. You and your fiance can totally do this. Drink water friend.I tried getting clonidine and benzos with no luck. I just read a lot or posts saying day 3-6 is the worst of it and on day 3 myself i was bad. Cant imaine sticking it out 3 more days of that. No matter where i go tho im going to have to so ill have to find a way thru it. And i did notice going outside for a few mins got my mind off of it. Def helped. I just have to stick this out somehowHopefully detoxing last weekend and this weekend has helped a little bit and not put me back at square 1You can do it! I was just trying to give you motivation in my post. I feel like you were missing the most essential tools from your tool chest. I don’t really know how you can obtain benzos or clonidine but those and cannabis (especially oil) are very helpful.Bro if you can get fent you need to just look harder and find some bars. They will seriously help you get through this, don’t abuse them and just look at the positive, if you’re writing this you’re still alive and have a chance to have an amazing life with your fiancé soon to be wife. Get to the wedding as clean as you possibly can and use eachother not to get high but to keep eachother clean because that’s the only way you’re going to get out of the vicious cycle. If you’ve fought withdrawls for 3 days then you can do it for 4,5 you really can do this man. 

EDIT: ALSO wax. Cannabis oil. RSO. Eat 1000mg of edibles. Do something that will incapacitate you that doesn’t harm you in the long run. Stay safe. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I'm 19. Been on heroin 3 years nobody knows but I'm at my huge breaking point please read, Content: I been crying all day I have no one to vent to. It would mean a lot for blunt advice I have never asked for advice..I'm 19 a guy I started using at 16. Daily at 17. I'm now 19. I have a job I side houses. I'll bring home at least 500 every Friday. My family doesn't know because I snort heroin 

             Hiw much heroin I snort and spend


So when I got paid friday I immediately called my dealer my h dealer is 19 just like me except shes a women. She gave me .3 for $100. I did all that in 4 hours went to sleep.

Saturday morning i. woke up crying my back hurted.
So I called her and I said "hey why do you keep giving me .3 for a 100 this is the 20th time in a row" 

45 minutes later she called me and said I'm outside. So I go give her $100. 

I go back inside and weigh it. It's exactly. 37. Omfg. Such a RIP off I think. So I did all that and I woke up Sunday crying again almost fr at my breaking point. I'm I crazy or something?
I call her and say I cant stand u giving me .3 give me 2 grams and make up this shit come on u got me crying. 

So she comes and gives me guess what. .4 for $100 she just came a hour ago.

I did .1 so far. And I still feel sick. But I cant do more because I'll have to call her.

Shittyplugz

Zhittyplugz, ups: 7, downs: 0it's super easy to find a new dealer... not exactly safe though... pm me if ya want some help. but yeah i used to getta gram of fentadope for $80... fuck her almost not worth the struggleSounds like your getting ripped off hard, where I am $100 is 1.5g street priceYou’re getting ripped off BAD. Tell you want 2 grams, wrap a $20 around a bunch of $1’s, and then block her #. Fuck that bitch.[deleted]That ganger slut deserves a slap around the fucking face. You need to find a new dboy my man.where i am 100 is about 5-7 small capsules of fentadope.Rob the bitch take your money back and give her a slap.[removed]Dude no don’t be spending that much ever!!! Literally would be doing yourself a favor finding someone else to go though or drive to IL honestlyHey man! I can’t really speak to your dealer issue, I have a great documentary about teenage opioid use that you might find helpful. Please pm me if you wanna check it out!!Tell her you're not gonna pay anymore unless you see her weigh it. Then (if you want to pay her a fair price) only give her $10/.1 MAX. Personally I'd find a new plug, then try to get one over on her to make up for the straight up robbery she's been committing, but if she knows where you live this may not be a bright idea. Find a new plug either way though.Bruh why tf u putting up with a dealer like that like come on there are probably like a million h dealers near uDamn dude this blows, luckily my dboy hooks it up with 80 Gs and 250 balls. But I’ve dealt with countless fucking skimpy ass plugs that just rip you off over and over again.here in the Netherlands is can get 1gram 15-20euros pure #3 afganFr!!!!!!! After I get a new dealer.Nope I like Detroit I'm not saying I'm there so dont report this comment I'm just saying I like Detroit I'm not living their tho ;).1 capsule ?You are breaking more than one rule with this post. Read them, only warning.They said there gonna pay me back. So I'm waiting for my friend to pick me up then were gonna go to themIn UK its like £40 a gram of 3Lmao man, 100 for .3 cut dope, just go cold turkey and if you want to keep using find something decent ffs this takes away ALL self respect.[deleted]Usually .2 they are 00 size and packedK deleted it3g for 40 ? Thats great price.Yeah that's what everyone's saying. But right now my friend is gonna be here in any second. Then were going 25 mmminuttttesss into the town to get our H. She said she will give me some for freeI think he meant #3 heroin. Not 3 grams. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Any ideas on why I can’t get high from IVing H?, Content: I’ve been using opiates for 6-7 years now, the past 2 of which I’ve been smoking heroin. Ive recently had about 3 weeks off all opiates, and took suboxone a few times early on during that period. A few weeks ago, after not taking suboxone for a week, I smoked some H and had a decent nod going, but the next time I smoked, the high was very much diminished of course, so I decided to IV it.  I’ve never slammed it before, but recently have had my friend give me shots, yet I feel nothing. I know the dope is good cause he nods off all day from a single shot and I can sort of feel it when I smoke it. It’s been a week again since my last suboxone (4mg) and it was just that single dose, with no other subs in the past 7 days, yet I’m not feeling the H like I know I should when slamming it. I know I’m not missing the shots, the dope is good quality, and the suboxone should be out of my system, yeah? Can anyone explain why this is happening? Am I some mutant that can’t get high from IV use?, ups: 1, downs: 0Probably just not doing enough, ive never smoked H but im pretty sure it comes up faster when smoking it

At least thats how it works with fent.What is the shot a .1? Either way you should feel something from the dope after a week of no subs @ 4mg. Maybe try boofing? Or monkey water.Yeah, I wondered if that was the case. Thank you, I’ll try a bit more in the shot and see! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Trying heroin once, Content: No, don’t worry, I don’t plan on doing this. From what I’ve read before I’m definitely not going to risk trying heroin. 

However, I’m just curious, is heroin really in that different a ball park to other drugs (except other hardcore opiates like fentanyl)? I’ve tried oxycodone a few times and didn’t get addicted, same with cocaine, Xanax, lean etc. 

I’ve never tried crack, meth or heroin and don’t plan on doing so - but how addictive are crack and meth - compared to heroin, and compared to the other drugs I mentioned? And are there any other super addictive drugs I’ve forgotten?, ups: 2, downs: 0Much plan, many try without immediate negative consequence...Used to be addicted to oxys up until recently. I once tried shooting H because I was very young and stupid and thought it wasn’t any different than the oxys I was doing. I was violently ill and literally couldn’t stay awake or move much immediately for about 12 hours, couldn’t even drink water. Thank god I had that reaction or I think I would’ve been way worse off - not that I think I could’ve brought myself to shoot myself up every day. Someone did it for me the one and only time. So technically yes, you can do it once and not be addicted. Oxys used to make me a little nauseous at first but continue to do them and you’ll start handling it better. Making things a habit or doing it too often is what does it to people I think.Before I'd tried H, I'd done most drugs - weed, psychedelics, speed, coke, crack, MDMA, mephedrone, benzos etc. I'd even done other opiates - codeine, tramadol and oxycodone - extensively. I'd never had an addiction issue with any of them. I thought if anyone was in a position to try H and not get addicted, it would be me who had been fucking with oxys for years without getting hooked. Me, who had smoked crack many times without becoming a crack addict. Me, who had never done coke two days in a row. I figured I'd be able to try H and then put it down, like *every single other drug I'd tried*.

I was wrong. Yes, it is different. Why is hard to explain, but for me it's like heroin touched a deeper part of me than any other drug, even other strong opiates. The feeling of contentment and peace on heroin hit me right in my core, in a way that felt more fundamental than other drugs. Don't get me wrong, MDMA, base & coke made me more "euphoric" and feeling *happier*, but heroin fundamentally changed my relationship with myself, my life & reality by giving me a taste of what real, true, deep fulfillment, bliss & contentment can feel like. It gave me a peace that nothing else had. It was like going back to the womb. I'd have tastes of that feeling with high doses of oxy, but nothing like the deep gut-punch of bliss that H gave me. 

Initially after trying it I tried to forget about it, but I found it on my mind constantly. I started to think & fantasize about it all the time. Suddenly alcohol, weed, socializing, sex, friends and all the normal elements of life just didn't feel satisfying in comparison. I obviously wasn't *physically* hooked the first time, but mentally it had snared me. It showed me such an intense feeling that it was impossible to resist for long. 

Yeah. Heroin is different. People don't just say that because they're the kind of idiots with no self control who would have gotten hooked on anything put in front of them, they say that because there are a lot of us who had tried and put down everything else and then found to our eternal regret that when people said heroin was different, they weren't fucking lying.It’s addicting cuz it’s cheap (at least at first), it’s dangerous because of cuts/varying potency. Relatively same high tho25% of people who try heroin become addicted. 75% do not.

No drug is more addictive than another -- it depends on the person.  I don't like alcohol, but some people get addicted to alcohol easily. I like opiates but other people hate them.  So it's not the drug. It's the person.Thanks for sharing man, I sometimes feel the temptation to try it just based on how good it sounds, but I’m well aware that it’ll be 1000x more tempting once I’ve felt it, so I won’t. Have you tried any other opiates by any chance - is there an intermediate between oxy and h addictiveness, like maybe morphine, I wonder?

Hope all is well and you’re able to get sober, love.Same high as oxycodone?Are those actual statistics or a rough estimate?I've tried oral morphine and found it lacking. I know the BA isn't great, but for me it was like morphine had all the sedation of H but without that extra quality that made H so blissful. If you must use a strong opiate then morphine is probably more advisable than H, especially if you only use it orally. I've been told by others that when injected there isn't much difference, but I can't speak on that as I've never injected any opiates except H.

By the way, a note on the addictiveness of H. I've seen quite a few people use H their first time, and all of them went on to get hooked. A typical experience was a friend of mine. He smoked it, and he first reported it was underwhelming. He was expecting something more intense. Nevertheless, a couple of days later he does it again. Again, he says its underwhelming. However, when he's high he starts talking about how useful H can be - how, unlike coke, there's no comedown, and it's so cheap, and how he really enjoys nodding but is sure that he won't get hooked because he doesn't like it *that* much. Within a month or so he was using daily. My experience with H was love at first sight, but a lot of people report feeling underwhelmed as they went in with crazy high expectations, and then use the fact that they were underwhelmed as justification to continue, not realizing that it's pulling them in. 

That feeling I got when I first started using H in the honeymoon phrase, that incredible bliss & serenity, became elusive quickly. These days I get it only if I *really* push the boat out, which becomes dangerous quickly. IVing added a whole new dimension to the addiction, since the H rush is a beast in and of itself, and obviously feels amazing at first. However, every single story of people trying heroin ends the same way - a lot of regret, misery, addiction - and they're the lucky ones that are still alive. I was arrogant enough to not listen to the advice of everyone who tried to stop me, thinking I knew better, and it started with me toying with the idea like you are now, and progressed over a period of time to me deciding I'm try it one day, then actively sourcing it, and then eventually doing it, conning myself the whole time. 

I hope you don't go down the same path. Have you tried codeine?? Before strong opiates, codeine gave me a really really nice high. It was a great taste of opiates, but without the pull to compel me to do it again & again. Tramadol was stronger than codeine but an odd high due to its mixed action and it just wasn't quite as pleasant. Morphine was really nice, but it was too sedating and not nearly as euphoric as H or even oxy. Oxy was great - I know a lot of people get hooked on it, but I was able to keep it to once every month or two I'd binge for a couple of days then put it down. 

I've never tried it personally, but it sounds like what you may be looking for is hydrocodone (Vicodin)?? My understanding is that its stronger than codeine but not in the same tier as oxy/morphine/heroin, and if you are opiate naive then it should get you a nice high. I just implore you not to fuck with H. On /r/drugs and the drug-specific subs, you see threads all the time about how thankful people are that they've found X drug - molly, weed, shit even then /r/stims board have been known to make threads singing the praises of fishscale. When was the last time you saw a thread about how thankful someone was they started doing heroin?For the most part. I’ve found that oxy, tramadol and kratom have more of a stimulating high for me, and all the others are more sedating. They are all sedating at a high enough dose. With h tho, that high dose could be a bag or a match head sized amount where as with a pill you can take your dose according to your tolerance and know how much your getting, unless it’s pressed.That stat is kind of misleading. If you are already addicted to opiates or love the high then your odds of addiction to h in the future is much higher.Actual statistics from NIDA, National Institute on Drug Abuse.Yep, exactly to ur last point, don’t worry I’ve pretty much concluded in my head it’s not worth it.

I’ve done codeine a bunch of times, it always feels very subtle, to the point where I’m not sure if I’ve placebo’d the whole thing. Codeine with promethazine in lean I feel much more, I really enjoy doing that from time to time. And I’ve done oxy a few times - orally it makes me too nauseous to enjoy it, but I fuck with it snorted occasionally (when I can get my hands on it). Hydrocodone has always sounded ideal to me, I honestly prefer the more subtle feeling I get from codeine and lean to oxys - but I live in the UK where I’ve literally never seen hydros being sold, and I don’t wanna use the dark web. Think I’ll just stick to a bit of lean here and there lol. 

Thanks, uv definitely helped reinforce my opinion on not ever trying to get HI tried heroin (China white or whatever the fuck it was) once and was really underwhelmed. I was expecting what you described. That feeling of bliss and contentment and peacefulness. Do you think that that’s just how some people react? Or was I doing the wrong kind of H? I want that feeling you said you got but I’m wondering if maybe I’m trying the wrong kind of H.Yeah igy. What’s the order of strength of the opiates uv done in ur opinion?Yh I get uThe stat is talking about people who try heroin, not people who are already on it.I also live in the UK and that's also why I've never done Vicodin. I used to use oxy as it was prescribed to me for an injury - how did you get your hands on it?? As you know, dealers don't sell it in our country. How did you get lean as well?? I didn't know we had that here either.

What dose of codeine were you taking? To get high I used to have to CWE an entire box, so roughly 300mg, and I ended up increasing it to 450mg after the first couple of times. It definitely wasn't subtle  - it didn't have the punch of the stronger ones, but there was no doubting I was high. 

If you are ever tempted again to use H, I'd suggest getting to grips with the dark web and getting hydrocodone. It's honestly not that hard to use the dark web markets, and it opens up a whole new world of drugs. Round where I live there are literally zero psychedelic dealers (believe me, I looked A LOT before I found the dnm) so being able to finally try LSD was such a blessing, and it never would have happened without the DNMs. It's not that hard to use once you read a guide or two, and as long as you follow some simple rules like not bulk buying, using reputable sellers and never signing for the packages then the chance of you getting busted is way, way lower than buying drugs on the street. Just something for you to think about! btw how old are you?> By the way, a note on the addictiveness of H. I've seen quite a few people use H their first time, and all of them went on to get hooked. A typical experience was a friend of mine. He smoked it, and he first reported it was underwhelming. He was expecting something more intense. Nevertheless, a couple of days later he does it again. Again, he says its underwhelming.

Did you skip this part? If you live in America there's a very good chance what you took had little or no actual heroin in it and was primarily a fentanyl analogue. The phrase "china white" doesn't mean anything anymore. It used to denote a specific kind of heroin, then it meant any good heroin, now all it tells you is that its not black tar. I'd put my money on you getting some heroin that wasn't actually heroin, or had very little in it. Dose could be the second factor. If it was cut you may have done enough just to get sedation but no actual high. Another factor could be ROA. How did you take it? Many people love heroin the first time they try it, but everyone falls in love when they shoot it, because where heroin really really shines is in the needle. Fourth, as I described above, some people just don't take to it at first - they may have a naturally less responsive mu opioid receptors and a proliferation of the subset of delta receptors, meaning they're more susceptible to sedation than euphoria. For these people they would need to habituate for a while to heroin, coax out what is for them a subtler high and play around with dose and ROA before they get the full experience. I would suggest doing exactly none of this and instead consider yourself lucky you tried H then walked away none worse for wear.I’m 20. Without going into too much detail, I managed to meet fellow student who uses dark web and also has a bunch of plugs for all sorts. He’s supplied me xans, vals, oxy, acid, 2cb and lean. The lean isn’t made by a legit pharmacy, but in some illegal lab somewhere I think, but it comes in professional looking bottles and everything - pretty sure it’s still the same ingredients. The oxy is very legit, comes in blister packs - if u look on my profile I think I’ve got a pic of it - shortec 10mg.

As for the codeine, 30mg codeine phosphate is prescribed pretty easily, me and my friends hv got it for things like migraines/diarrhoea quite often, and then most I’ve ever took is 10 pills I think, so 300mg. Definitely felt something that time, so if I get it again I’ll try and up the dose to ~350 maybe.

And Yh good idea if I’m ever tempted I might aswell hv a go on dark web for an alternativeI did read that but I was wondering if maybe I just got the wrong stuff. I’m ugly and awkward and have bad social anxiety so cold coping isn’t really an option. 

I snorted it. Like a half a match head size. So you’re saying that I can get the same feeling you’re taking about if I keep trying? Some people get it right away and some have to use for a while? Or is it likely to always just sedate me and not much else?If you can get the pure codeine pills then even better - if you definitely want to feel it and didn't feel much from 300 then I'd say you could go to 500 and be fine. The ceiling is somewhere around there anyway so you don't have to worry about taking too much. Also take some tums or gaviscon or something to neutralize your stomach acid about half an hour before taking the pills. I'd always suggest taking codeine all in one dose - I know rappers rap about sipping lean, but once the enzyme starts metabolizing codeine to the active opioids (morphine and something else) it becomes resistant to further codeine exposure meaning that re-dosing becomes pointless, so taking the entire dose in one go means you ensure you get all of it.Interesting, ok, will try that for sure. Most of the time I only did 200mg which might be why I didn’t feel muchif you take 500 then max 45 minutes later you should definitely be feeling high. If you take a full 500mg and don't feel high then either the pills are bunk or you may be one of the rare people who were born without the enzyme necessary to convert codeine to its active metabolites, which will mean if you want to experience opiates you'd have to try tramadol, hydros etcPills straight from doctors, but yh like I say I’ve felt a little bit before and definitely feel lean so think I’m in business, just been dosing wrong � @@@@@@@@@@ Title: This is the bag from a conference I went to earlier this month, Content: , ups: 111, downs: 0Very cool. It's great to see people organizing and presenting solutions to our outdated dysfunctional attitude toward substance use and abuse. Reform is what we need now. It's way overdue and the consequences of our lack of understanding is causing myself and possibly a million more some serious problems. I like to sight the declaration of independence where it states the three "unalienable rights" given to all people by their creator for Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. It goes on to say governments are created to protect these rights. It's my opinion that if my pursuit of happiness involves someone to ingest something that comes from an opium poppy then so be it. As long as my pursuit of happiness doesn't affect your three rights then I don't see how we can judge. It's time we keep evolving our mentality for the greater good and stop imposing ideas of morality to drug use. It has become a public health issue, not a legal or moral issue. Drug liberalization is the destination we need to be going in. I believe this is a personal choice like a religion or being a vegan. We have created huge problems with old stigmas and laws passed out of racism and other ignorant motivations. Lets keep on  showing people how off track we are with ridiculous concepts like a war on drugs. Its impossible to have a war on drugs. What they want to fight is nothing but a direct result of what keeping criminalized created: crime. Hope the conference had something to do with this.Bruh I just shot a speedball of dignity and autonomy.Great meeting you and the kiddo. Thanks again for all the work you do!I like the large font. It is kinda 1970s.Isnt that kinda the same logo as Mundipharma?

Is everything tar out here or is there any powder like on the east coast?, ups: 2, downs: 0I’ve found powder out west, not very common tho , but I’ve also found FIRE tar.All tar all day...Tar unless your ordering on the darkside.Mostly tar unless its fent. Why do people prefer powder over tar, anyway?I prefer it because it's ready to sniff.   I don't bang and smoking feels like a wasteSo is the tar around here. I test it by breaking a chunk off with my fingernails, if its a clean break (or it crumbles into powder) its good to go, if it stretches at all instead of just breaking or feels overly sticky I hold it in front of the A/C in the car for a bit (or if its cold and dry outside like it frequently is here just hold it out the window or something) and try again. Once I know its cool/stiff enough I either throw a piece in a pill crusher, or put a piece in my phone, cover with a cigarette pack wrapper, and smash with a lighter. Then, of course, I sniff it.I didn't know you can do that! I've always tossed it with baking powder or monkey water. Will give it a go next timeThere's been times where I was in a pinch (like when my cars A/C went out) where I resorted to monkey water, but lately I haven't been having any problems. I live somewhere ***very*** dry (even when it snows it isn't very humid out) and it hasn't been more than 50° in at least 3 months, so now I just use that to my advantage. Like I said holding it outside for a bit, or even just pressing it up against a cold window for awhile does the trick. I've heard people say they've had success with their freezer but in my experience leaving the tar exposed in the freezer makes it cold but sticky, and putting it in some kind of container works for a minute it or so, but then condensation builds up on the container and it gets sticky again. Most cars' A/C should do the trick though. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: I think I may have taken fent laced xans, Content: I've tried oxycodone before but that's the hardest opioid I've ever done, so I'm not very familiar with what fent would feel like. Anyway I bought some xanax off of a stranger I met through an app. He was a cool guy and didn't seem too sketchy. I got home and ate half. About half an hour later I started to get itchy but chalked it up to a kratom dose. I wasn't feeling a whole lot, just a little relaxed so I took a whole bar and left to get a haircut. I got there and sat down and started getting very sleepy and had to try very hard to keep my eyes open, my breathing was also very labored and heavy. I didn't want to make a scene so I waited out my haircut and got in my car to look at my pupils. They were smaller than I've ever seen them before. I walked to a gas station and bought a big energy drink and chugged it. I had taken the full bar at 2:30, its 5:30 now and i can tell it's wearing off. Does this sound like fentanyl or something else? It felt like an opioid., ups: 2, downs: 0Have you done any benzos before?Ok I don’t know about you but whenever I take fent bars my bones literally hurt and my jaw and my head it is not fun at all I love fent and I love bars just not togetherIt was probably a pressed bar with a rc benzo that is stronger than your accustomed to. You only have a kratom tolerance if it was truly Xanax and fentanyl you would have nodded out completely and not left that barber chair. When in doubt test especially when buying drugs off apps from random strangers. This should be common sense practice Harm reduction before it's too late.Yes I've tried just about every benzo under the sun, never had anything that felt like thisThent it probably was laced, a test kit is the only way you're going to find out. Be safe!Have you ever taken fentanyl before? I'm wondering if that's what it is or another opiate, possibly an analogue. I took it at 2:30 and its almost 7 now and I'm still relaxed, itchy, and pinned. I thought fent only lasted a couple hoursActual fent has an elimination half life of about 8-10 hours, though the main high is about 2-3. Fent analogues make it more complex — they’ve got unknown durations as you’ve got no way of knowing which one you have :( @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Suboxone question, Content: If I’ve been on subs for a few months and then took hydrocone/h for 2 days, is there still enough residual suboxone in my system for me to take it again today (almost 24 hours since last use) without getting PWD?, ups: 2, downs: 0If you've been taking subs for a while and you only skipped 1 day to use you should be fine.

I was on subs for almost 2 years before I relapsed this last time and I would skip taking my subs for a day use h then take my sub the next day and never had precip. W.ds.[deleted]Is there fent in ur h? If so def wait. If not u should be sick enough at 24 hrs to take it. Not to mention u should have enough built up in your system to be fine anyway, but as the guy said, better safe than sorryNo that's not how it works. He still has buprenorphine in his system after taking a little hydro and heroin. He isn't going to risk having precipitated withdrawals because he has Suboxone still in his system. And I'm assuming he didn't feel shit when he decided to use. So no he doesn't need to wait longer to take his normal dose of bupe. You either didn't read his post correctly or you don't know what the hell Your talking about thus giving horrible advice. Don't respond unless your positive you know what your talking about... Your wasting eveyones time. No offense but come on.No Your both wrong. Bupe has a long half life. He still has bupe in his system and is 100% safe to take his Suboxone dose as normal. No risk of precipitated withdrawals when you have bupe in your system. It's the other way around buds... if you have opioids present in your system and take Suboxone too early then you get pwd. Hopefully you learned something valuable today for future reference. No need to reply to tough questions if your a rookie and don't understand the mechanisms of buprenorphine. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Wellbutrin and Percoset Interaction, Content: My friend has been taking 100 mg Wellbutrin everyday for around 5+ months.

Different systems. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Suboxone questions, Content: Hi everyone, 

First off I just want to make clear, I'm seeking advice and not people telling me "to steer clear, you don't want to end up on H" etc. or whatever.  If there's any opiate I use the most often, it's kratom which I'll use 1-2x weekly on and off.  Also have a moderate supply of trams, oxys, and hydros that I'll indulge in time to time but haven't had any of those in at least a couple months.  I recently got my hands on a few N8 M-box orange hexagon suboxone pills, and so far I really enjoy them.  I'd had a couple suboxone strips in the past from another friend a couple years ago, but forgot how they felt.  I know suboxone isn't a true opiate, and it's used to help people get off of harder opiates, usually that being Heroin; so I've seen the hate on people experimenting with subs.  

Anyways, I've got some questions as to how I can get the most bang for my buck out of these.  And not only that, but safety/dependence avoidance questions as well.

Firstly, what is the best way to get high with these?  My dude's told me take a quarter or even an eighth of a pill, intranasally.  Does this really have the best bioavailability, and/or is the length of the high equivalent to that of another ROA?  Also, how long does it need to be in your nose to absorb all of it? Lol because I was told to let it stay in your nasal cavity as long as possible before the drip.  And I've thrown up or had a runny nose, sneezed, or swallowed and caused the drip to start happening pretty shortly after taking it so I just wanna know if I'm not getting all of into my system then.  It's usually about 15-20 min before this happens.  

Also, I'm currently on a mood stabilizer that my doctor and I have learned over the past several months has had no real impact, so I'm currently slowly tapering off; been taking half a pill morning and night for the past couple months or so down from a whole pill morning and night.  Are there any serious interactions that could be happening between the buprenorphine or naloxone, and the oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)?  

Lastly,  and most importantly, how often can I take this (and how much, 1 or 2mg) to not build a dependence or start having withdrawal symptoms?  Like 2x a week max? 1x a week max?  Just looking for some advice on how to fuck around with a mild suboxone habit lmao.  It has more pros for me that the other opiates don't; it lasts forever, 2mg is a more energetic high, whereas 1mg is weirdly more of a relaxed traditional opiate feeling, and I am more productive in my classes and talkative and outgoing socially without looking totally scoooned.  

So yeah.  any advice on casual suboxone use is appreciated :), ups: 1, downs: 0Yeah snort and 8th or a quarter of a pill and you will be good for a lil while. Just know that subs ramp your tolerance up bad. I used heroin daily  for 10 years and was on sub maint for 2 years before I got off completley and it was roughStart low. 1mg. You can snort the pills sure but they aren't intended to be used that way but since your not on buprenorphine maintenance I won't tell you to take them sublingualy. They burn a little when used intranasal and have a hint or orange/lime flavor. 2mg would have you puking if your current tolerance is kratom. Not a huge recreational value medication no such euphoria but you will get a head change. Once again do you I don't condone using Suboxone when your not opiate tolerant and needing relief from withdrawal. I would stick to hydro and pecrs if I were you. Good luck. Be safe. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy dosing?, Content: Ok so lately I’ve been casually popping oxy 30s maybe 3 times a week. I’ve built a tolerance for it. Today I took 30 mg about 4 hours ago and it’s wearing off and didn’t hit that hard. I’m about to dose again another 30. Would it be any more harmful or dangerous if I did anymore than another 30 ??? I was thinking of maybe popping another thirty and A HALF? not really sure, ups: 1, downs: 0You’ll be fineIt would be fine but I’m gonna warn you my friend please don’t do it. Your on a slippery slope that I have fallen down myself and it does not end well at the bottom of the slopeI know man trust I play it cautious and know when  to give it a break I’m fine. Thanks. So I would be fine taking another 40-50 mg after I took that 30 hours agoEasilyWhen would I generally get into A threatening overdose dosageHonestly if it’s pharma grade oxy and not a press, I’ve doses up to 400mg in a day. Obviously that comes with tolerance but I think if you have just a mild tolerance, even going into the 100mg range wouldn’t be unsafe. Just don’t mix with benzos @@@@@@@@@@ Title: The biggest part of my addiction is snorting. Something about having that bitter taste up my nose and down my throat is so satisfying . Anyone else? Nodding out is also good, that warm blanket that makes me social , confident, and invincible is great as well, Content: , ups: 31, downs: 0Social? Idk about you but when I have a habit I’m the antithesis of social. I’ll be perfectly content just chilling in my apartment watching tv on a weekend night, alone. Where if I’m not doing dope I’ll go out with friends and find women to date. Heroin takes my sex drive down to 0. Social engagements lose all their luster. Cuz heroin is just THAT satisfying.Love the nod, but it would piss me off that I fell asleep during my shows and had to watch them again. (Good thing I record everything) or nodding out while scrolling my phoneWish we had snortable h where I live. Putting bth up your nose isn't fun at all. Works better than smoking but it's just so impure and weak that I need a rig to catch a nod. Now if there were still original OC 80s around. Those were so much fun. No nodding for me, just pure euphoria and awesomeness. I could crush and snort one anywhere, anytime. Pill crusher and pen tube, could do it while driving no prob. Not recommending just saying. And the smell, taste, so satisfying. Bring an opiate user sucks now by comparison, on west coast anyway.I haven’t nodded put in years.. need to get that feeling back . Not a IV user and never have been . I loved a good gouch but using H alone I just don’t get thatI agree. Not an addict, but I love snorting pills. I get that rush of dopamine as I’m crushing it up and cutting the lines. And that nod. My god the fucking nod. After I come out of the nod I can’t help but smile that tired looking “oh yea I’m feeling reeeeal fucking good now” type of smile. I ain’t social on opioids because I’m noticeably fucked up. So I do them in my room alone. I don’t even need to be with anyone else when I do them. I feel to damn good already.For me smoking it is my favourite ritual. Must be a pavlovian conditioning thing.I like shooting. That is so damn satisfyingMmmmm god, I love all of the above and miss it so fucking much! Soooo good I could almost orgasm from it lol �i hate snorting and always have. Snorting to me is a meticulous and painful procedure, first off I'd have to do push ups or jumping jacks just to get my sinuses clear so I'd actually get the powder up the cavity, or itll just stick in my nostril like a fat booger. Then that feeling would immediately give me a migraine, and the whole time I'd be waiting in pain, hoping to god that the drug will kick in soon enough for me to not notice the horror of what I just did. I will probably never snort powder again, to the point that I will wait to get all my gear for IV even if I am sick. IV and only IV (smoking maybe but I have never succeeded and don't want to waste)I nodded hard one time and dropped my phone off my lap. That was an $80 dollar fix :/I agree with this 100%SameeI agree that the bth in my area isn't great. It's pretty boring like you describe. The pills I used to get on the other hand were a whole other story. Made those situations you mention like the best ever every time. For me anyways with my various combos of opiates and benzos. It may get boring at some point but I've never got to that point. I think h is too sedating with not nearly enough euphoria. The black stuff anyway can't comment about ecp cuz I'm on other coast.Dropping my phone on my face is the worst.Truth!  If we could at least get pandas, at least occasionally out here - itd be much better.Fix it up like you would to go in a needle and snort it...You might be an addict"Top ten most oddly satisfying things"Nodding off and sending a text of garbled gibberish is almost as bad imo. �Lol. I usually dropped it on the floorPandas...took me a while to figure that one out. Opanas right? I'm sure they are as good as they sound. Oxymorphone, the name says it all to me. I've heard they are the opiate connoisseurs pill and I believe it. But I've never seen one. They were going around for a while and then like everything else went extinct. I think that's the only opioid pill I haven't tried. And that's because I quit before they came out. Since I relapsed because of a screwed up "rogue" methadone clinic that made up their own rules, pills are gone. I don't even bother asking anymore. No one has anything anymore and if they do they would want stupid money. But it never even gets that far. No one has anything I'd pay money for. The OCs are no fun anymore. But they just don't give out pain meds in my area. Maybe some vics/norco or percs nothing I'd want. It's crazy. It's like every Dr is scared shitless to write pain med scripts. A lot of Drs got in trouble with DEA. Some went to jail, some had careers destroyed and some got probation. The one I know that got probation is one of the most ethical Drs I've ever met. I went to him from many years before this probation went in to effect and I just cannot see him doing anything unethical. It must have been some real petty b.s. And now we are a country where legit chronic pain patients have to live in pain. As if our healthcare wasn't bad enough.Yeah kinda sorta. There's a little more to it, but basically. What I did for years and wish I'd never went any further is this. Like you said you cook up it similarly to how you would for injection. The only difference is you want to use a glass eye dropper. The amount of water you use is important. You want just enough to coat your sinus cavity. Too much and it goes down throat. It would always work out to be 10-15 drops for me. Depending on how much black your using. Don't need a cotton, obviously. Bring it to a boil for a few sec, suck it up dropper and make sure it's cool enough. You want to put your head all the way back so the dropper is vertical. Get it way up your nose and squeeze. Keep your head back and close your throat so no liquid or air is draining out. I've found a lot of technique to this to get good results. Plug your nose. Tilt your head sideways on direction of other nostril and you should feel that nasty vinegary, bitter stuff flow that way and burn other side. The better you coat your sinuses the better it works. I would then quickly bring head around so your looking at ground and you can feel it move forward. As long as nose is plugged and/or movement is quick enough you can coat whole sinus cavity without swallowing hardly any. With right amount of water you should have coated sinuses and not swallow it until after when your just catching drips. It's not fun and burns like hell but I've found works much better than smoking. Takes a few min to kick in but I've done it for people who exclusively smoke it and they get so loaded their like delirious. Much more efficient too. Prob uses 2-4x less than smoking. I think it might be the best way to go with bth. Hard to go back to though when moneys tight and every .1g could be the difference from waking up sick and being able to function at all or not.Was going to suggest this. I even had a syringe with the needle removed for shooting up in to my sinuses. It's a bit like getting water in your nose at the pool but the pain subsides and then the warmth sets in.
Been years though.I totally get why you’d say that. Not in the sense that I use all the time, but in the sense that I obsess over it. I hardly ever use, but there are days where I use multiple drugs, sometimes multiple a day, back to back for like week or more. Once I’m done with that “bender” if you will, I take a break from everything except weed for a week or more. After that’s up I use more carefully. One of those breaks is gonna have to happen soon speaking of. I might be somewhat of an addict though, just not in the traditional sense. I get that addiction comes in multiple forms.Thank you for the detail, I'm going to try your methodAddiction is a vague and hard to define term. Substance use disorders exits on a continuum. There should never be shame in having issues with substances.Enjoy. That method took me years to perfect so I'm sure they'll be some trial and error. Every other user I knew mainlined. The first time someone told me about a water line I was literally trying to snort a line of liquid. As long as you have a glass eyedropper you can't go too wrong. Tried smoking for a while and it just didn't do it for me. Most of it goes up in smoke. Can't be too great on the lungs either will all that vinegar acid in there. Went many years surrounded by IV users with that method. I really haven't met anyone else who adopted it like I did. I didn't care though, it worked for me. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Tramadol and hydrocodone same time?, Content: Hey I took 200mg tramadol 4-5 hours ago. Starting to wear off. I don’t have anymore.

This thing says it’s risky , or is this page for wimpsThanks guys. Let you know if I dieYou should be fine. I am prescribed roxicodone and tramadol and they say it is ok for me to take them at the same time if I need to (I am on 30mg roxicodone every 4 hrs and 50mg tramadol 3x a day)Those pages tend to be very much on the safe side @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Is it bad to swallow a burned Oxy?, Content: So I gave my opiate naive roommate half of a 40mg of Sandoz Oxy. He insisted on smoking it and not swallowing it or snorting it, despite me telling him that smoking is a waste.

Anyway, he smoked some of it, but it didn't burn right. So there is about 10-15mg left but it's all burned. Can I take it?, ups: 0, downs: 0Yep.Why would you think swallowing the rest of a pill that's been smoked, would be harmful?  We eat grilled food thsts got a little black charred edges and are fine. 

Its gotta be some poisonous or sharp objects to do harm if swallowed.

I remember like 8years ago i was still sniffing and my real good friend was shooting. I took him to cop and we went back to his house to chill.  I tried to smoke a little $10 chunk but the shit was like burning plastic. It burned too harsh to smoke and was mostly black when i stopped after a small hit. He was broke and i had gave him a shot so when i went to toss the burnt piece he wanted it to shoot it.  Didn't do anything bad to himThere’s no harm in eating it. It may just not work at all. You could probably even crush the rest and snort it.Yep I can eat it safely or yep it is bad to swallow?Isn't the bioavailability lower snorted than oral?It's not going to hurt you.Yes, probably. Since you’d be eating the whole thing and snorting it may not all be absorbed. Either way, it’s not gonna hurt you. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: NEed to Know Fast - MEthadone, Content: Hi! I’n pretty new here.

I’ve never really gotten any recreational use out of tramadol but I was wondering if it might help smooth my withdrawal symptoms. Thanks in advance!, ups: 2, downs: 0Yeah it will help but damn dude tramadol really sucks and could give you seizures is there any way you could do kratom instead? Im very biased against tram but kratom would be safer.What’s this kratom all about I am hearing it more these days what is it ?? Is it for getting clean ??Tramadol did absolutely nothing for me as far as withdrawal relief. Hope it does for youYeah tramadol helped me with withdrawal , I’ve heard shit about seizures, I took anywhere from 300 to 700 mg daily of it never got any, I DO NOT recommend dosing that high, everybody is different, just speaking my experience.You can but I just take it when I'm hurting or I want the buzzTram just gave me restless legs like a mother fuck unless you can take literally 800-1000 mgs ONLY if you have a high opiate tolerance. Kratom is def better and more helpful in the long run. Using other opiates will prolong your wd symptomsI love kratom and I’m a huge advocate for kratom but unfortunately I’m not mobile and didn’t think to bring anyIt's a miracle plant. Completley clean now other than Kratom. Give it a try. I recommend not buying it from head shops/gas stations. Buy it online if you can, it's much cheaper that way.Tramadol gives a bitch of a withdrawal all on it's own.  Don't even start taking it.  It's a mediocre pain med.U take it daily ? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Opiates and Combating pinned pupils, Content: So someone posted a while ago asking for advice on how to combat pinned pupils. Someone responded and said the ingredient phenylephrine in 4 way nose spray will diulate pupils back to normal if you just put a few drops of 4 way nose spray or even the off brand Walgreens nose spray in your eyes and I think every opiate addict should know about ou ut this because I tried it and it 1000 percent works just make sure you dont put too much. Just 1 or 2 drops in both eyes because too much will not only diulate them too big but will also make one bigger than the other. It takes about 30 minutes to work but it really does. Just thought I'd share this information for anyone who may need. Your welcome!!, ups: 1, downs: 0That was me. 

Any anticholinergic will also work. 

I also specifically said that it was a joke and probably not a terrific idea. But since you didn’t die (or go blind) we’ll let it slide. As an aside phenylephrine or oxymetazoline will also stop epistaxis and priapism as well as unblocking your nose. 

It’s quite handy to have. 

Take care and Merry Christmas �We really shouldn’t be encouraging people to put stuff in their eyes that’s not formulated to go there. 

Glad it worked thoughI have had the unpleasant side effects of using wayyy to much oxymetazoline way to quickly, whilest also opiated. I haven't touched the stuff since.Lol no I've done it multiple times now and it's worked fine everytime and definitely am not blind so thankyou for that seriously. It has literally saved my ass and my long term relationship.Really.. I had no idea that oxymetazoline would stop a priapism.. I remember the first time I read about that condition and how funny I thought it was that someone could end up with a chronic or "permanent" hard on through no fault of their own. I imagine that would be very painful after a while. 

Learn something new everyday.What happened that was unpleasant?Well here's how the hear how happened. My nasal cavities were clogged as a construction workers portajon, that shit wasn't going anywhere til I did something about it so I could snort my precious roxicodone. We have a few miscellaneous bottles of nasal spray here and there and all but one are just saline solution which is just fine. Normally I'll fucking hoover about 10 squirts of saline solution because my sinuses stay raped from all the oxycodone and that's (each nostril). 

Soooo. I ask my GF for the nasal spray. She hands me some nasal spray after a quick search and, you know us junkies, we put too much faith and trust that the next person especially our SO will have our best interests in mind. So I thought it was harmless saline instead of 12hr two pump and done omtzl. So I did about 12 pumps up the first  nostril, and 10 up the other. A this while I had already had about 180mgs of Oxy if I recall correctly. So after realizing I'd made a rather large mistake. I researched side effects and accidental overdose. Nothing seemed life threatening aside from random drop in blood pressure and slow/fast heartbeat.

I was good for about 1hr 15minutes and then within minutes I went from feeling decent to feeling like I was carrying the weight of the world on my back, and my heart rate jumped to probably over 170bpm and I went to my GF and collapsed. For all of about five seconds. Woke up shaking with pupils the size of half dollars and a myriad of all types of weird feelings. My heart rate had dropped to about 45-50bpm but for hours I felt generally in danger and impending doom. It took around 10hours to feel better. Alot more happened, but my phones at one percent.No worries. Good to hear things worked out for you!Unfortunately you have to inject the phenylephrine into the corpus cavernosum. Taking a hit from the bottle or spraying it on your old fella doesn’t work. You should see the abject terror and pleading in a mans eyes as you hold a syringe in one hand and his throbbing tumescent erection in the other as you prepare to stab him. 

Of course, the key in such a situation is to try and *avoid* eye contact altogether. Then you don’t have to say the obligatory “no homo”. But it’s still advised, just to be extra safe...

Unfortunately as a heterosexual man, I have handled more penises than I would have liked. To be honest, one was too many. But such is life. They never said it was gonna be glamorous...I imagine that is probably how it feels to be a female OBGYN? I wouldn't know.. I always had a male Dr. I am not homophobic by any means and have even tried playing for the same team.. just not my thing lol. 

I also suppose that being a proctologist would be the epitome of "No Homo"My proctologist during my last exam suddenly said "it's completely normal to get an erection".
I told him I didn't have an erection.
He said "I was talking to myself".My first day of university I imagined I’d help crippled children walk again, cure cancer, restore sight so an elderly person could see their grandchild playing with a puppy.

Instead I wound up getting bitten by a smack addict whose life I just saved because she was angry I Narcan’d her, extracting crayons from small children, shaking my head in a state of disbelief that someone had inserted a small ornamental statue into their rectum or fondling another mans erect penis for money. 

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I shoulda been a dentist. 

Merry Christmas mate �That’s funny I always felt much more comfortable with a female OBGYN. Different strokes for different folks I supposeHa!!! Thats funny shit.LMAO, thanks!!Hahaha. The taste of shattered dream.. oh how it burns! 

Yes, merry ChristmasMost of my friends are the same.  I do not know why I had a difficult time getting used to the females at the clinic I went to.. perhaps because they were both a little brisk in manner and believe it or not, the male Dr would actually warm up the speculum and the lube jelly. Lol.Ok now THAT is reason enough right there LOL @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy/methadone/withdrawal question?, Content: Took my last half oxy30mg at around 11AM today then shortly thereafter found out my plug is out of commission. 

I scrambled around my room for a 10mg Methadone pill I hid, and found it, and took half of it around 530PM (the smaller half, saving rest for tomorrow) in an effort to curb the withdrawals I would experience tonight.

Tomorrow morning I plan on taking the other 5-6mg of methadone. Then I plan on taking blues as normal when my plug is back around. Will I be good to take blues at 5-7pm after having dosed methadone in the morning? Or is that a waste?

Any insight appreciated., ups: 1, downs: 0I would be more worried about the duration that “out of commission” equates to?5mg of Methadone will have very little effect on the high from the blues. Unlike subs it doesn’t have any blockers.He said he’ll be back tomorrow, he is just unavailable at the moment.In that case I would wait a bit longer, methadones half life is 24hrs!!Meaning I won’t feel shit if I take the blues tomorrow night?10mg is a very low dose. It will not block the oxy. You’ll still be able to get high as a kite tomorrow night. Happy nods. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Oxy euphoria, Content: How does oxycodone euphoria compare to other drugs? (excluding Heroin, Morphine,codein...), ups: 2, downs: 0It's less intense than stimulants but it feels nicer.

With other drugs you can be very euphoric but they wear you down after you use them as opposed to opiates which are always comfortable making them more rewarding.Mdma is the most fitting of the word euphoria - your whole body feels energised and nice, and you love everything. Music sounds amazing

Cocaine you feel on top of the world, like you’re amazing and everything you’re doing is right and great, and you have lots of energy and focus

Acid feels a bit like mdma, like this glow and energy deep inside your stomach, and a kind of restlessness. Acid can vary a lot but when it’s good you feel in tune with everything like music and sounds and smells and sights etc

And then with oxy you feel cosy, warm and comfortable, ultra relaxed and content, without the energy of some of the others

Lean is similar to oxys, but you’re more drowsy and intoxicatedQuestions regarding what are intensely subjective experiences only have meaningful answers when given to yourself by yourselfWhat drugs are you trying to compare it to if you say excluding all other opiates?Any drug that gives you fellings of euphoria ex. Coke, acid, mdma etc.It’s like apples and oranges in my opinion. Coke is more like a “I’m god, I can take on the world” type euphoria. Oxy feels more like a “I couldn’t give less of a shit about the world, I feel so warm, content and relaxed” type. 

I feel like on oxy i just sit and absorb the euphoria and that’s the main focus, but on meth or coke the speediness of it is my main focus and the euphoria is more in the background. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Can you smoke fent patches?, Content: Question above, ups: 2, downs: 0if gelyesI have transmandal patches? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Imagine how much easier everything would be if opiates were completely legal, sold at every pharmacy, and maxed out at $.25 cents a pill, Content: You would instantly save over a million opiate addicts a lot of grief, suffering, heartache, and possibly prevent their deaths. The game has been ruined by fakes. So many roxys are fakes and it's at the point where you cannot even tell unless you take them or chemically test with a reagent. The other day i got a fake K9! They are now even faking K9s! WTF! It's time to legalize this stuff., ups: 91, downs: 0Haha where I live in South America it’s basically this. I can buy 10/325 hydro over the counter at about 1.40$ each. Not sure that is the answer though. I would have never started taking these if they weren’t so easy to get. I can get them on almost every cornerI concur. 

I’m hoping one day I’ll be able to walk into a retailer and peruse the plethora of sensual delights available for purchase at everyday low low prices. Imagine being able to walk into Costco and purchase a 10 litre special buy of ketamine for $19.99 or a bulk pack of 500 40mg IR Pandas for $9.99 along with your toilet paper and potato gems. 

Alas, I fear it will not happen in my lifetime. As such, we are implementing the emergency exodus protocol. The day before I retire, I write dozens of fake scripts for enough “Special K” and dillies to last me the rest of my life, then hightail it to the airport and hop on the first plane to a non extradition treaty country where I will spend the rest of my days like Col. Kurtz. 

High (pun intended) in the mountains, commanding my praetorian guard of indigenous locals and other acolytes as I shit post on reddit and taunt the authorities. Eating mangoes (year round, not just in season) and being fanned by a buxom and nubile young lady wielding a palm frond as another ~~equally~~ *more* buxom woman hand feeds me grapes and winks seductively. 

Either that or I get arrested by the feds and thrown into super max in disgrace. One of the two. 

Anywho, I hope you have a wonderful day and Merry Christmas �It would indeed. Unfortunately with our current unhealthy mentality with drugs that might be a bit too much freedom for some people to handle. I'm down with the natural drugs be decriminalized and unregulated. Amsterdam has this philosophy and I think it makes sense. But getting back to the free for all scenario. It would be wild in the beginning. There would absolutely be a lot of people ODing. And probably a spike in addicts. But after the ones who OD either die or learn a lesson and non-addicts look at the junkies and maybe decide that's not the road they want to go down. I actually think abuse and addiction would eventually go down. It shouldn't be too different than alcohol. Prohibition increased drinking and it went down once it was repealed. Things aren't as cool or fun when it's legal.I wish my mailman would deliver them every day.  Would solve a fuck load of problems in this country.The alcohol lobby wouldn't like this.I don't think making it completely legal would be the solution. There would be so many addicts. A system like the one in Switzerland is perfect. Addicts can get pharma Heroin (yes IV Heroin too), Subutex, Methadon, Oxycodone and therapy completely free. You don't have to taper down or something, they want you just to be happy. If you want to increase your dose, you can. If you want to get clean, they will help you. Everything is completely free and legal. But we shouldn't make it OTC because there would be so many new addicts, which should be avoided.It would definitely reduce a ton of the current social and public health consequences of criminalization. So many issues with people using opiates are not related to the actual use, but the procurement and quality of our drugs. Two of my grandparents had decades-long benzo and opiate scripts and both lived full, happy lives into their early 80s. 




But we shouldn’t pretend that this wouldn’t come without other unforeseen costs. Many more naive users would mean ODs from mixing with alcohol or other substances, driving while high would probably become more of an issue. Those are the ones I can guess off the top of my head.





And as much as I want you all-and myself- to have access to what I want/need when We need it for a fair price, I don’t relish the idea of many more people following down our path of reliance on opioids. 





There are solid models for decriminalization and supervised/monitored use that could be implemented in North America that would be a tremendous improvement. Let’s move towards a path of decriminalization and destigmatization before we start selling 500 10/325 Kirkland Brand OxyContin in every community.Itd be amazing. Crime would go down, people wouldn't lose their jobs, homes, etc.It should be like this.Death rates drop to 0I agree. There's no question there would still be an epidemic, but there would be anyway and how we're dealing with it now, it's only getting worse. There's no easy way out but making sure people know what they're getting would decrease deaths a lot.Nobody would be dying or going to rape jail, that'd be a nice start.  Like, a dignified human life as it should be.I got a fake k56 that looks just like a real k56. I still have it too! i have a bottle of fake pills i collected since i started using. Its ashame how good they are getting at it too. Scary �Except y’all idiots would buy a fuck ton of pills cause your tolerance is so high, then overdose. It wouldn’t really change a thing. Except maybe black market sales but I bet there would still be an opioid epidemic.Some countries have legalized H and stuff and it does cut way down on deaths and overall addiction and crime rates.
It could work on a large scale, infact I'm pretty sure Vancouver Canada does something like this with their Heroin Compassion Clubs, it would be beneficial if they could sell pharmaceuticals to people who use them because presses are dangerous for alot of people.
If education was reformed to teach people the truth and proper facts about drug use and addiction. 
Keep on thinking this way! We need more to learn and believe in a cause like this.

If they wanted to end the opiate crisis all they would have to do is let the ones who suffer the most make some rules and have input on policy. Allow us the people to have a say in the thing that affect only us but until we have overcome our vilification of opiate addiction on a larger society level that will not happen.

Together we stand the best chance.Just imagine, getting oxy 120s for a quarter.i just wanna pitch in real quick, i know im late. i think this is absolutely the right way to go about this, and all drugs really. Its not an issue of legal opiods being problematic, its that prohibition is more problematic than legalization. We need only look  at other countrys that do this with codiene and dhc. 

i dont think its fair to make people with severe medical issues either jump through hoops or go without for any reason. The problems legalization would solve far outweigh any theoretical problems it could produce. Drug use actually went down after portugal did  their big decriminalization and i dont think our results would be that different.I've often wondered this my self.  I mean look at alcohol.  It's the most widely used drug, easy to get and for the most part cheap depending on how you look at it.  Plus marijuana is becoming more widely accepted.  So just let people make up there own minds what they want to put in there bodies without government interference.Apparently back in the day, when some things were legal, people didn't suffer today the way people do now. Drug addiction didn't so often result in homelessness and loosing everything. Most people worked and had a family and were fairly high in functioning in the world.

Then they criminalized it and people had to access it in different ways, it cost more money ect. so ppl started to become desperate and there was a rapid decrease in the "functioning addict". Ppl started the cycle of jail,  and poverty. People became desperate and lost their jobs, their family's ect. And the war on drugs began!

Besides it being a awesome fantasy when ur using that it was cheaper, better, and more accessible... It would actually save lives and improve people's lives.Well, in some EU countries, as long as you got your health insurance, you can go with your ATM Drugs-o-mat picking up your 200mg pure pharma heroine for IV or in Pill, even lifetime, and go at work.

It's just a matter how culture, and it's complicated to apply a model of "legalizing" addicting substance, causing probably lot more of addicted. 

Bur the prohibitionist way used so far in many other country seems just made the whole worst.

It's just all about money, for pharmaceuticals, and for cartels. Nobody really care about the addicted as individual.I'd be happy if they could just decriminalize drugs for a start.What can us Americans do to make this a reality? There's more than enough of us to lobby for it. Why don't we go and filibuster congress everyday for months or as long as it takes to make this a reality! Lol who's in? Plus I hear that DC. Dope is pretty good. LolOpium has been around for thousands of years fuckin people up homes.... it’s just not sustainable.

I wish it was too... ask China 150 years ago.

now thats some old school shit, and a name i havnt heard in a looong timeAtleast you’re realisticYou'd be dead in a week.Wtf is a potato gem lol. And yes that’s literally the only thing that stood out to me in this amazing diatribeJust pay "patients" to fill the RX's for you and pay them well. Then no report to agencies right?You are the man dude, just made my night lolHonestly can the ODing really get any worse than now. Fent pressed 30s raining on every corner and fentdope killing the unknowing. I get where your coming from but we’re out here dying already.All the better[deleted]I’m glad someone else is saying this. Even absent all the shit I’ve gotten into from lack of money or access, I wouldn’t wish the life of an opiate addict on anyone. This would create more addicts.In the Joe Rogan Exp #1250 with Johann Hari they talk a lot about this Switzerland experiment and the new modern views on addiction. Would very much recommend if anybody here is interested to watch and listen.I genuinely don't think it's the laws that are preventing most people who aren't addicted from being addicted. Just like the people I know who don't smoke weed don't refrain for legal reasons - they just don't like the idea of something affecting their faculties. I really don't think we'd suddenly have a nation full of new addicts. The people who want it can find it as is (speaking at least for metro areas, where I've spent my life), and generally don't hesitate to.  It would certainly make it safer for addicts though. Predictable doses, purity, and safety in obtaining. 
The war on drugs has essentially nothing going for it.This may be a possible reality but also complete legalization deregulation would cut out the whole organised crime - mafia - cartel & terrorism funding \ involvement. It would pad the state and governments pockets while reducing the violent drug related crimes most likely. There would be advantages and disadvantages either way. Deregulation Potentially could in theory save millions of lives in the long run.It may make more sense to kind of deal with it like we do methadone in the US. Daily doses can be handed out at clinics for people who are *already* addicts. And in order to participate in these clinics there could be mandatory groups and counseling. Like 1 mandatory group meeting per week/month and 1 counseling session per week. This way people are kept safe and aren’t taken advantage of while also receiving help for the issues causing the addiction and being taught healthier coping mechanisms. Along with mandatory harm reduction and safety education classes at intake. And the option for voluntary rehab/detox to completely quit.

After being a part of the program for x amount of time you can reduce the mandatory group and counseling sessions. Because at some point they will no longer be affective. 

I see this eliminating a lot of the issues that people have raised with legalizing and making opioids easier to obtain. The harm reduction and safety education classes should reduce the dangers of overdoses via mixing meds and inform everyone of the dangers of driving while high. 

The counseling and groups will hopefully help people who wish to get clean, actually get clean.  And the cheaper cost plus easy access should lower drug driven crimes (such as muggings and stealing to support their habits), while also cutting down the viability of cartels and the crime associated with them. And the clinics being for addicts only should at least somewhat stop a ton of new addicts being created.

Obviously some people will still abuse the setup and some new addicts will be created but I still suspect this would overall improve a lot of the current issues caused by the current opioid epidemic.

The only problem I see with this would be the cost. Who’s going to pay for the counselors, clinics, and group leaders. I’m sure it can be done reasonably but it’s still something that needs to be figured out so that it’s affordable and accessible.Should be like the medical marijuana market. Get a card an be limited to so much a month.Forgive me, but I fail to see how you have reached this conclusion. People would still very much lose their homes and jobs, because rather than selling off everything, they'd be taking higher and higher doses, until they either die or can barely function *(see "hamsterdam" from the excellent show "The Wire" to see what this might look like)*

Property crime, theft, robbery would indeed be down, but it would be met with increases in accidents. Addicts would be victimized far more, sexually assaulted, robbed, their children victimized, as non-addict criminals find them completely nodded off or outright passed out and take advantage.

Maybe they are getting revenge which is all the more reason people should be able to be safer, more natural opiates.Like you?

Multiple, *multiple* studies have shown that legalisation of drugs, opioids specifically, reduces the amount of crime, overdose deaths, and other things.

Not just studies. There are a handful of countries that have already done it and are better off for it.Exactly dude it just that easy. Addiction is a choice right? Fuck out of here little pony. What rock do you live under? If it was that easy no one would be addicted. Quitting is easier said than done you dimwit.Ive seen on here people say Columbia and Nicaragua are 2 of them.....but Id be really hesitant to go to some places down there..mmmmm I've also heard some Asian countries (Thailand is one). 

Plus a good many countries just have looser prescribing laws to begin with and have way cheaper and easier to get opis. So really America is a shit place to be when it comes to scoring opisThere are very few of us left, it pains me to say, my friend.Not delusional at all.

Infinite supply of SAFE opiates, where people know what they're getting.

Sure some people couldn't handle it and would die, but it would be just like how some people can't handle alcohol in a responsible way.

The only way to stop the current "opioid crisis" a.k.a. the fentanyl crisis is more access to safer to use opioids.

Junkies gonna junk, might as well let themThe real problem is people who want to dictate to others how to live.  Junk food is inexpensive and widely available, but plenty of us aren't getting fat and enjoy a good cupcake from time to time.Well it certainly wouldn't make the opioid epidemic the US is currently facing any worse. I'd be interested to know why you think OP is delusional for this way of thinking.You can ask me, I know the institute, people getting their treatment there and people working there.Yeah if you can buy Heroin everywhere the chances are higher that you try it. I was very lucky that I could get opiates. It is not that easy for everyone, even if you have the desire to use.Yeah, I’m fine with Subs or methadone being ‘on demand’ essentially, without the need to pay a doc every month. Make it more like birth control.





 It probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to provide pharma-grade heroin, although in that situation more frequent engagement with providers could be encouraged. Even if it’s once a week to go pick up your supply and the provider has to ask, “are you ready to quit?” To which I can just say, “nope! I’d like 7 heroins, please!” And be on my way. Remove stigma and access barriers that cause dangerous behavior, let people lead normal lives and go from there. I WANT to taper off of subs at a reasonable rate because I hate the idea of needing to show up somewhere every 30 days. Eventually, many people will opt for some form of treatment.





And I’d add. Respect the addict to know something about detox. This current model of locked away for 3-7 days, removed from the outside world is abusive and unnecessary. Give me a 7 day supply of gabapentin, clonidine and a few benzos and I can detox myself at home while still going to work and being with my family. We’ve all done it, just with varying access to comfort meds.





Edit: regarding cost, every addict who is taken to jail on simple possession can be taken straight to one of the treatment hubs, enroll in the heroin program, means test a payment plan, and be on their way.It's proven that when you give virtually unlimited access of heroin to junkies, the tendency is for them to stabilize their doses and rather decrease them eventually, not take higher and higher doses until they die or can barely function.

Also, when heroin prescription was the go-to treatment for heroin addicts in the UK from 1926 to 1967, most addicts had jobs. When Dr. Marks started prescribing heroin and cocaine for hundreds of addicts in Liverpool in the 80s and 90s, many of them also became functional and kept jobs. So yeah, it's expected that most junkies would hold down jobs if given a safe and controlled amount of their drug of choice. Prohibition makes mantaining the habit almost like a secong job. Prescription kills that.They've have successful studies where its cheaper and more effective just give a script of heroin for junkies.  Surely some people would go off the deep end, but any more than now?  I wouldn't think so.  If nothing else it stabelizez the eviroment and variables which is always a good thing, esp with something that is already injerantly not stable lime opiates.

And the driving.  Well you would still get in trouble, just like you do now.It wouldn't be any worse than alcohol is now.  There are plenty of us who can handle both their drugs and drink just fine.  Some people aren't going to have any control over certain things, but that shouldn't be my issue to deal with.me (and a friend of mine) have been using for about 5 years straight now and we use about the same amount everyday. We both have jobs where we work with people who would notice if we were “zonked out” during working hours, and while we’re lucky enough to have good jobs to always have a weeks worth of stuff stocked away (in case something goes wrong with a source) if prices were to go down I honestly don’t think we’d start any more, we’d just have more money to buy nicer things in life.

I realize that not everyone is like us, but tons of people are already suffering under the current situation, surely some kind of semi-legalization would help. not saying you should be able to buy your opiates at costco, but allowing any addict to go to the doctor and be given opiates to manage their addiction would only improve things.Eh, yeah kinda.  But its not really the governemtns place to say.  Mixing, yeah.  Overdosing is pretty hard if your taking a script only.  And yeah, if your high and driving you shouldn't do that.  But not really related if opiates should be banned.It should be your right to put whatever you want into your own body.The violence would also greatly decrease as cartels and and gangs have less controlWhat happens when you use up all your pills for the month, with still 15 days left?What would this help exactly? Non-addicts and lesser-addicts would simply sell you theirs, recreating the black-market, and just dropping the prices. It would be nothing to find someone to sell you more than enough to kill yourself with in such a world. Not to mention it would create a whole lot of new addicts, since the only thing stopping more vulnerable teens in boring areas from recreationally trying opiates, is lack of easy access.Wait!?! This makes the idea worse, weirder and harder to enforce. You’ve created a new job though. Sober poor people turn into pill runners.




Not to mention the amount of tracking involved with this. Then the national database of pill buyers leaks and we have a data set of every addict in the country. Not to mention before it leaks the government has this info.Yes sorry BOT.The British did this, but the US did not have a hand in pushing opium in China. The US tiny involvement in the second opium war, was just about opening more trade, but not for opium.Legalization isn't the same thing as subsidizing it and selling it OTC.I don't believe for a moment that this would be the case in the US. There is a vast difference between legalizing it in a small country with a tiny, vigorously taxed population with robust health services and the United States, 327 million people strong, highest drug use rates in the world already, whose idea of mental health services is prison. 

It would be an utter disaster if it were legalized here. It would eliminate some problems and create far more. We do not have the infrastructure, culture, size, nor government style needed to handle such a thing even remotely responsibly. Be very careful what you wish for.Lol, ok. Keep telling yourself that and you’ll always be the winner you are ;)so right man, I feel yah. Can't believe I found Viagra in dubai OTC. lmao, Also in India, I heard drugs are so cheap and they don't ask for a prescription most the time ._.Cambodia is supposed to be super relaxed, from otc benzos to "happy pizza" with shroom toppings from the streets.Title: Imagine how much easier everything would be if opiates were completely legal, sold at every pharmacy, and maxed out at $.25 cents a pill, Content: You would instantly save over a million opiate addicts a lot of grief, suffering, heartache, and possibly prevent their deaths. The game has been ruined by fakes. So many roxys are fakes and it's at the point where you cannot even tell unless you take them or chemically test with a reagent. The other day i got a fake K9! They are now even faking K9s! WTF! It's time to legalize this stuff., ups: 90, downs: 0Haha where I live in South America it’s basically this. I can buy 10/325 hydro over the counter at about 1.40$ each. Not sure that is the answer though. I would have never started taking these if they weren’t so easy to get. I can get them on almost every cornerI concur. 

I’m hoping one day I’ll be able to walk into a retailer and peruse the plethora of sensual delights available for purchase at everyday low low prices. Imagine being able to walk into Costco and purchase a 10 litre special buy of ketamine for $19.99 or a bulk pack of 500 40mg IR Pandas for $9.99 along with your toilet paper and potato gems. 

Alas, I fear it will not happen in my lifetime. As such, we are implementing the emergency exodus protocol. The day before I retire, I write dozens of fake scripts for enough “Special K” and dillies to last me the rest of my life, then hightail it to the airport and hop on the first plane to a non extradition treaty country where I will spend the rest of my days like Col. Kurtz. 

High (pun intended) in the mountains, commanding my praetorian guard of indigenous locals and other acolytes as I shit post on reddit and taunt the authorities. Eating mangoes (year round, not just in season) and being fanned by a buxom and nubile young lady wielding a palm frond as another ~~equally~~ *more* buxom woman hand feeds me grapes and winks seductively. 

Either that or I get arrested by the feds and thrown into super max in disgrace. One of the two. 

Anywho, I hope you have a wonderful day and Merry Christmas �It would indeed. Unfortunately with our current unhealthy mentality with drugs that might be a bit too much freedom for some people to handle. I'm down with the natural drugs be decriminalized and unregulated. Amsterdam has this philosophy and I think it makes sense. But getting back to the free for all scenario. It would be wild in the beginning. There would absolutely be a lot of people ODing. And probably a spike in addicts. But after the ones who OD either die or learn a lesson and non-addicts look at the junkies and maybe decide that's not the road they want to go down. I actually think abuse and addiction would eventually go down. It shouldn't be too different than alcohol. Prohibition increased drinking and it went down once it was repealed. Things aren't as cool or fun when it's legal.I wish my mailman would deliver them every day.  Would solve a fuck load of problems in this country.The alcohol lobby wouldn't like this.I don't think making it completely legal would be the solution. There would be so many addicts. A system like the one in Switzerland is perfect. Addicts can get pharma Heroin (yes IV Heroin too), Subutex, Methadon, Oxycodone and therapy completely free. You don't have to taper down or something, they want you just to be happy. If you want to increase your dose, you can. If you want to get clean, they will help you. Everything is completely free and legal. But we shouldn't make it OTC because there would be so many new addicts, which should be avoided.It would definitely reduce a ton of the current social and public health consequences of criminalization. So many issues with people using opiates are not related to the actual use, but the procurement and quality of our drugs. Two of my grandparents had decades-long benzo and opiate scripts and both lived full, happy lives into their early 80s. 




But we shouldn’t pretend that this wouldn’t come without other unforeseen costs. Many more naive users would mean ODs from mixing with alcohol or other substances, driving while high would probably become more of an issue. Those are the ones I can guess off the top of my head.





And as much as I want you all-and myself- to have access to what I want/need when We need it for a fair price, I don’t relish the idea of many more people following down our path of reliance on opioids. 





There are solid models for decriminalization and supervised/monitored use that could be implemented in North America that would be a tremendous improvement. Let’s move towards a path of decriminalization and destigmatization before we start selling 500 10/325 Kirkland Brand OxyContin in every community.Itd be amazing. Crime would go down, people wouldn't lose their jobs, homes, etc.It should be like this.Death rates drop to 0I agree. There's no question there would still be an epidemic, but there would be anyway and how we're dealing with it now, it's only getting worse. There's no easy way out but making sure people know what they're getting would decrease deaths a lot.Nobody would be dying or going to rape jail, that'd be a nice start.  Like, a dignified human life as it should be.I got a fake k56 that looks just like a real k56. I still have it too! i have a bottle of fake pills i collected since i started using. Its ashame how good they are getting at it too. Scary �Except y’all idiots would buy a fuck ton of pills cause your tolerance is so high, then overdose. It wouldn’t really change a thing. Except maybe black market sales but I bet there would still be an opioid epidemic.Some countries have legalized H and stuff and it does cut way down on deaths and overall addiction and crime rates.
It could work on a large scale, infact I'm pretty sure Vancouver Canada does something like this with their Heroin Compassion Clubs, it would be beneficial if they could sell pharmaceuticals to people who use them because presses are dangerous for alot of people.
If education was reformed to teach people the truth and proper facts about drug use and addiction. 
Keep on thinking this way! We need more to learn and believe in a cause like this.

If they wanted to end the opiate crisis all they would have to do is let the ones who suffer the most make some rules and have input on policy. Allow us the people to have a say in the thing that affect only us but until we have overcome our vilification of opiate addiction on a larger society level that will not happen.

Together we stand the best chance.Just imagine, getting oxy 120s for a quarter.i just wanna pitch in real quick, i know im late. i think this is absolutely the right way to go about this, and all drugs really. Its not an issue of legal opiods being problematic, its that prohibition is more problematic than legalization. We need only look  at other countrys that do this with codiene and dhc. 

i dont think its fair to make people with severe medical issues either jump through hoops or go without for any reason. The problems legalization would solve far outweigh any theoretical problems it could produce. Drug use actually went down after portugal did  their big decriminalization and i dont think our results would be that different.I've often wondered this my self.  I mean look at alcohol.  It's the most widely used drug, easy to get and for the most part cheap depending on how you look at it.  Plus marijuana is becoming more widely accepted.  So just let people make up there own minds what they want to put in there bodies without government interference.Apparently back in the day, when some things were legal, people didn't suffer today the way people do now. Drug addiction didn't so often result in homelessness and loosing everything. Most people worked and had a family and were fairly high in functioning in the world.

Then they criminalized it and people had to access it in different ways, it cost more money ect. so ppl started to become desperate and there was a rapid decrease in the "functioning addict". Ppl started the cycle of jail,  and poverty. People became desperate and lost their jobs, their family's ect. And the war on drugs began!

Besides it being a awesome fantasy when ur using that it was cheaper, better, and more accessible... It would actually save lives and improve people's lives.Well, in some EU countries, as long as you got your health insurance, you can go with your ATM Drugs-o-mat picking up your 200mg pure pharma heroine for IV or in Pill, even lifetime, and go at work.

It's just a matter how culture, and it's complicated to apply a model of "legalizing" addicting substance, causing probably lot more of addicted. 

Bur the prohibitionist way used so far in many other country seems just made the whole worst.

It's just all about money, for pharmaceuticals, and for cartels. Nobody really care about the addicted as individual.I'd be happy if they could just decriminalize drugs for a start.What can us Americans do to make this a reality? There's more than enough of us to lobby for it. Why don't we go and filibuster congress everyday for months or as long as it takes to make this a reality! Lol who's in? Plus I hear that DC. Dope is pretty good. LolOpium has been around for thousands of years fuckin people up homes.... it’s just not sustainable.

I wish it was too... ask China 150 years ago. 


GodspeedThis is fuckn retardedOr just gtfo them?Where in south america again? Just for my school homework not going there for sure.Doc you are truly a treasure on this sub.

now thats some old school shit, and a name i havnt heard in a looong timeAtleast you’re realisticYou'd be dead in a week.Wtf is a potato gem lol. And yes that’s literally the only thing that stood out to me in this amazing diatribeJust pay "patients" to fill the RX's for you and pay them well. Then no report to agencies right?You are the man dude, just made my night lolHonestly can the ODing really get any worse than now. Fent pressed 30s raining on every corner and fentdope killing the unknowing. I get where your coming from but we’re out here dying already.All the better[deleted]I’m glad someone else is saying this. Even absent all the shit I’ve gotten into from lack of money or access, I wouldn’t wish the life of an opiate addict on anyone. This would create more addicts.In the Joe Rogan Exp #1250 with Johann Hari they talk a lot about this Switzerland experiment and the new modern views on addiction. Would very much recommend if anybody here is interested to watch and listen.I genuinely don't think it's the laws that are preventing most people who aren't addicted from being addicted. Just like the people I know who don't smoke weed don't refrain for legal reasons - they just don't like the idea of something affecting their faculties. I really don't think we'd suddenly have a nation full of new addicts. The people who want it can find it as is (speaking at least for metro areas, where I've spent my life), and generally don't hesitate to.  It would certainly make it safer for addicts though. Predictable doses, purity, and safety in obtaining. 
The war on drugs has essentially nothing going for it.This may be a possible reality but also complete legalization deregulation would cut out the whole organised crime - mafia - cartel & terrorism funding \ involvement. It would pad the state and governments pockets while reducing the violent drug related crimes most likely. There would be advantages and disadvantages either way. Deregulation Potentially could in theory save millions of lives in the long run.It may make more sense to kind of deal with it like we do methadone in the US. Daily doses can be handed out at clinics for people who are *already* addicts. And in order to participate in these clinics there could be mandatory groups and counseling. Like 1 mandatory group meeting per week/month and 1 counseling session per week. This way people are kept safe and aren’t taken advantage of while also receiving help for the issues causing the addiction and being taught healthier coping mechanisms. Along with mandatory harm reduction and safety education classes at intake. And the option for voluntary rehab/detox to completely quit.

After being a part of the program for x amount of time you can reduce the mandatory group and counseling sessions. Because at some point they will no longer be affective. 

I see this eliminating a lot of the issues that people have raised with legalizing and making opioids easier to obtain. The harm reduction and safety education classes should reduce the dangers of overdoses via mixing meds and inform everyone of the dangers of driving while high. 

The counseling and groups will hopefully help people who wish to get clean, actually get clean.  And the cheaper cost plus easy access should lower drug driven crimes (such as muggings and stealing to support their habits), while also cutting down the viability of cartels and the crime associated with them. And the clinics being for addicts only should at least somewhat stop a ton of new addicts being created.

Obviously some people will still abuse the setup and some new addicts will be created but I still suspect this would overall improve a lot of the current issues caused by the current opioid epidemic.

The only problem I see with this would be the cost. Who’s going to pay for the counselors, clinics, and group leaders. I’m sure it can be done reasonably but it’s still something that needs to be figured out so that it’s affordable and accessible.Should be like the medical marijuana market. Get a card an be limited to so much a month.Forgive me, but I fail to see how you have reached this conclusion. People would still very much lose their homes and jobs, because rather than selling off everything, they'd be taking higher and higher doses, until they either die or can barely function *(see "hamsterdam" from the excellent show "The Wire" to see what this might look like)*

Property crime, theft, robbery would indeed be down, but it would be met with increases in accidents. Addicts would be victimized far more, sexually assaulted, robbed, their children victimized, as non-addict criminals find them completely nodded off or outright passed out and take advantage. Child neglect would go way up, children born addicted would go way up, accidental child deaths would go way up, suicides would go way up.   


There would be a significant ill effect on the economy, with addicts being zoiked out around the clock no longer participating in either generating income, nor spending much.This is just a naive understanding of how people die on opiates. Plenty of people are either mixing it with other scripts, taking more of their script than their infirm body can handle, etc. not to mention the secondary deaths from driving/just existing while fucked up.

It would be an utter disaster if it were legalized here. It would eliminate some problems and create far more. We do not have the infrastructure, culture, size, nor government style needed to handle such a thing even remotely responsibly. Be very careful what you wish for.Lol, ok. Keep telling yourself that and you’ll always be the winner you are ;)so right man, I feel yah. Can't believe I found Viagra in dubai OTC. lmao, Also in India, I heard drugs are so cheap and they don't ask for a prescription most the time ._.Cambodia is supposed to be super relaxed, from otc benzos to "happy pizza" with shroom toppings from the streets.Title: Imagine how much easier everything would be if opiates were completely legal, sold at every pharmacy, and maxed out at $.25 cents a pill, Content: You would instantly save over a million opiate addicts a lot of grief, suffering, heartache, and possibly prevent their deaths. The game has been ruined by fakes. So many roxys are fakes and it's at the point where you cannot even tell unless you take them or chemically test with a reagent. The other day i got a fake K9! They are now even faking K9s! WTF! It's time to legalize this stuff., ups: 92, downs: 0Haha where I live in South America it’s basically this. I can buy 10/325 hydro over the counter at about 1.40$ each. Not sure that is the answer though. I would have never started taking these if they weren’t so easy to get. I can get them on almost every cornerI concur. 

I’m hoping one day I’ll be able to walk into a retailer and peruse the plethora of sensual delights available for purchase at everyday low low prices. Imagine being able to walk into Costco and purchase a 10 litre special buy of ketamine for $19.99 or a bulk pack of 500 40mg IR Pandas for $9.99 along with your toilet paper and potato gems. 

Alas, I fear it will not happen in my lifetime. As such, we are implementing the emergency exodus protocol. The day before I retire, I write dozens of fake scripts for enough “Special K” and dillies to last me the rest of my life, then hightail it to the airport and hop on the first plane to a non extradition treaty country where I will spend the rest of my days like Col. Kurtz.

Anywho, I hope you have a wonderful day and Merry Christmas �It would indeed. Unfortunately with our current unhealthy mentality with drugs that might be a bit too much freedom for some people to handle. I'm down with the natural drugs be decriminalized and unregulated. Amsterdam has this philosophy and I think it makes sense. But getting back to the free for all scenario. It would be wild in the beginning. There would absolutely be a lot of people ODing. And probably a spike in addicts. But after the ones who OD either die or learn a lesson and non-addicts look at the junkies and maybe decide that's not the road they want to go down. I actually think abuse and addiction would eventually go down. It shouldn't be too different than alcohol. Prohibition increased drinking and it went down once it was repealed. Things aren't as cool or fun when it's legal.I wish my mailman would deliver them every day.  Would solve a fuck load of problems in this country.The alcohol lobby wouldn't like this.I don't think making it completely legal would be the solution. There would be so many addicts. A system like the one in Switzerland is perfect. Addicts can get pharma Heroin (yes IV Heroin too), Subutex, Methadon, Oxycodone and therapy completely free. You don't have to taper down or something, they want you just to be happy. If you want to increase your dose, you can. If you want to get clean, they will help you. Everything is completely free and legal. But we shouldn't make it OTC because there would be so many new addicts, which should be avoided.It would definitely reduce a ton of the current social and public health consequences of criminalization. So many issues with people using opiates are not related to the actual use, but the procurement and quality of our drugs. Two of my grandparents had decades-long benzo and opiate scripts and both lived full, happy lives into their early 80s. 




But we shouldn’t pretend that this wouldn’t come without other unforeseen costs. Many more naive users would mean ODs from mixing with alcohol or other substances, driving while high would probably become more of an issue. Those are the ones I can guess off the top of my head.





And as much as I want you all-and myself- to have access to what I want/need when We need it for a fair price, I don’t relish the idea of many more people following down our path of reliance on opioids. 





There are solid models for decriminalization and supervised/monitored use that could be implemented in North America that would be a tremendous improvement. Let’s move towards a path of decriminalization and destigmatization before we start selling 500 10/325 Kirkland Brand OxyContin in every community.Itd be amazing. Crime would go down, people wouldn't lose their jobs, homes, etc.It should be like this.Death rates drop to 0I agree. There's no question there would still be an epidemic, but there would be anyway and how we're dealing with it now, it's only getting worse. There's no easy way out but making sure people know what they're getting would decrease deaths a lot.Nobody would be dying or going to rape jail, that'd be a nice start.  Like, a dignified human life as it should be.I got a fake k56 that looks just like a real k56. I still have it too! i have a bottle of fake pills i collected since i started using. Its ashame how good they are getting at it too. Scary �Except y’all idiots would buy a fuck ton of pills cause your tolerance is so high, then overdose. It wouldn’t really change a thing. Except maybe black market sales but I bet there would still be an opioid epidemic.Some countries have legalized H and stuff and it does cut way down on deaths and overall addiction and crime rates.
It could work on a large scale, infact I'm pretty sure Vancouver Canada does something like this with their Heroin Compassion Clubs, it would be beneficial if they could sell pharmaceuticals to people who use them because presses are dangerous for alot of people.
If education was reformed to teach people the truth and proper facts about drug use and addiction. 
Keep on thinking this way! We need more to learn and believe in a cause like this.

If they wanted to end the opiate crisis all they would have to do is let the ones who suffer the most make some rules and have input on policy. Allow us the people to have a say in the thing that affect only us but until we have overcome our vilification of opiate addiction on a larger society level that will not happen.

Together we stand the best chance.Just imagine, getting oxy 120s for a quarter.i just wanna pitch in real quick, i know im late. i think this is absolutely the right way to go about this, and all drugs really. Its not an issue of legal opiods being problematic, its that prohibition is more problematic than legalization. We need only look  at other countrys that do this with codiene and dhc. 

i dont think its fair to make people with severe medical issues either jump through hoops or go without for any reason. The problems legalization would solve far outweigh any theoretical problems it could produce. Drug use actually went down after portugal did  their big decriminalization and i dont think our results would be that different.I've often wondered this my self.  I mean look at alcohol.  It's the most widely used drug, easy to get and for the most part cheap depending on how you look at it.  Plus marijuana is becoming more widely accepted.  So just let people make up there own minds what they want to put in there bodies without government interference.Apparently back in the day, when some things were legal, people didn't suffer today the way people do now. Drug addiction didn't so often result in homelessness and loosing everything. Most people worked and had a family and were fairly high in functioning in the world.

Then they criminalized it and people had to access it in different ways, it cost more money ect. so ppl started to become desperate and there was a rapid decrease in the "functioning addict". Ppl started the cycle of jail,  and poverty. People became desperate and lost their jobs, their family's ect. And the war on drugs began!

Besides it being a awesome fantasy when ur using that it was cheaper, better, and more accessible... It would actually save lives and improve people's lives.Well, in some EU countries, as long as you got your health insurance, you can go with your ATM Drugs-o-mat picking up your 200mg pure pharma heroine for IV or in Pill, even lifetime, and go at work.

It's just a matter how culture, and it's complicated to apply a model of "legalizing" addicting substance, causing probably lot more of addicted. 

Bur the prohibitionist way used so far in many other country seems just made the whole worst.

It's just all about money, for pharmaceuticals, and for cartels. Nobody really care about the addicted as individual.I'd be happy if they could just decriminalize drugs for a start.What can us Americans do to make this a reality? There's more than enough of us to lobby for it. Why don't we go and filibuster congress everyday for months or as long as it takes to make this a reality! Lol who's in? Plus I hear that DC. Dope is pretty good. LolOpium has been around for thousands of years fuckin people up homes.... it’s just not sustainable.

I wish it was too... ask China 150 years ago.

now thats some old school shit, and a name i havnt heard in a looong timeAtleast you’re realisticYou'd be dead in a week.Wtf is a potato gem lol. And yes that’s literally the only thing that stood out to me in this amazing diatribeJust pay "patients" to fill the RX's for you and pay them well. Then no report to agencies right?You are the man dude, just made my night lolHonestly can the ODing really get any worse than now. Fent pressed 30s raining on every corner and fentdope killing the unknowing. I get where your coming from but we’re out here dying already.All the better[deleted]I’m glad someone else is saying this. Even absent all the shit I’ve gotten into from lack of money or access, I wouldn’t wish the life of an opiate addict on anyone. This would create more addicts.In the Joe Rogan Exp #1250 with Johann Hari they talk a lot about this Switzerland experiment and the new modern views on addiction. Would very much recommend if anybody here is interested to watch and listen.I genuinely don't think it's the laws that are preventing most people who aren't addicted from being addicted. Just like the people I know who don't smoke weed don't refrain for legal reasons - they just don't like the idea of something affecting their faculties. I really don't think we'd suddenly have a nation full of new addicts. The people who want it can find it as is (speaking at least for metro areas, where I've spent my life), and generally don't hesitate to.  It would certainly make it safer for addicts though. Predictable doses, purity, and safety in obtaining. 
The war on drugs has essentially nothing going for it.This may be a possible reality but also complete legalization deregulation would cut out the whole organised crime - mafia - cartel & terrorism funding \ involvement. It would pad the state and governments pockets while reducing the violent drug related crimes most likely. There would be advantages and disadvantages either way. Deregulation Potentially could in theory save millions of lives in the long run.It may make more sense to kind of deal with it like we do methadone in the US. Daily doses can be handed out at clinics for people who are *already* addicts. And in order to participate in these clinics there could be mandatory groups and counseling. Like 1 mandatory group meeting per week/month and 1 counseling session per week. This way people are kept safe and aren’t taken advantage of while also receiving help for the issues causing the addiction and being taught healthier coping mechanisms. Along with mandatory harm reduction and safety education classes at intake. And the option for voluntary rehab/detox to completely quit.

After being a part of the program for x amount of time you can reduce the mandatory group and counseling sessions. Because at some point they will no longer be affective. 

I see this eliminating a lot of the issues that people have raised with legalizing and making opioids easier to obtain. The harm reduction and safety education classes should reduce the dangers of overdoses via mixing meds and inform everyone of the dangers of driving while high. 

The counseling and groups will hopefully help people who wish to get clean, actually get clean.  And the cheaper cost plus easy access should lower drug driven crimes (such as muggings and stealing to support their habits), while also cutting down the viability of cartels and the crime associated with them. And the clinics being for addicts only should at least somewhat stop a ton of new addicts being created.

Obviously some people will still abuse the setup and some new addicts will be created but I still suspect this would overall improve a lot of the current issues caused by the current opioid epidemic.

The only problem I see with this would be the cost. Who’s going to pay for the counselors, clinics, and group leaders. I’m sure it can be done reasonably but it’s still something that needs to be figured out so that it’s affordable and accessible.Should be like the medical marijuana market. Get a card an be limited to so much a month.Forgive me, but I fail to see how you have reached this conclusion. People would still very much lose their homes and jobs, because rather than selling off everything, they'd be taking higher and higher doses, until they either die or can barely function *(see "hamsterdam" from the excellent show "The Wire" to see what this might look like)*

Property crime, theft, robbery would indeed be down, but it would be met with increases in accidents. Addicts would be victimized far more, sexually assaulted, robbed, their children victimized, as non-addict criminals find them completely nodded off or outright passed out and take advantage. Child neglect would go way up, children born addicted would go way up, accidental child deaths would go way up, suicides would go way up.   


There would be a significant ill effect on the economy, with addicts being zoiked out around the clock no longer participating in either generating income, nor spending much.This is just a naive understanding of how people die on opiates. Plenty of people are either mixing it with other scripts, taking more of their script than their infirm body can handle, etc. not to mention the secondary deaths from driving/just existing while fucked up.





And yeah, I’m sure booze is worse, but creating ease of access for the entire population is not a good idea.If nothing else its not illegal so the quality of life improves immensely.  For the users, communities that are effective by distribution and production, etc.

It certainly wouldn't be any worse, and would in some ways be much better.  Less beheading in mexico etc.That's why they'd be regulated and quantity limited, per monthA heroin**e** is a female who faces danger or adversity and displays courage.

They know what they are doing. China turns a blind eye towards these factories while in turn cause a very tactical drug flooding.Actually that was political. The British and Americans were saturating the place with huge amounts of opium and the Chinese govt wanted to get some control over the situation. So they fought a two part war with the British over it. I'm sure many people were abusing it but probably because of poverty and poor living conditions. I'll repost this article someone recently posted.
https://reason.com/2019/11/29/the-myth-of-the-opium-war/
Maybe they are getting revenge which is all the more reason people should be able to be safer, more natural opiates.Like you?

Multiple, *multiple* studies have shown that legalisation of drugs, opioids specifically, reduces the amount of crime, overdose deaths, and other things.

Not just studies. There are a handful of countries that have already done it and are better off for it.Exactly dude it just that easy. Addiction is a choice right? Fuck out of here little pony. What rock do you live under? If it was that easy no one would be addicted. Quitting is easier said than done you dimwit.Ive seen on here people say Columbia and Nicaragua are 2 of them.....but Id be really hesitant to go to some places down there..mmmmm I've also heard some Asian countries (Thailand is one). 

Plus a good many countries just have looser prescribing laws to begin with and have way cheaper and easier to get opis. So really America is a shit place to be when it comes to scoring opisThere are very few of us left, it pains me to say, my friend.Not delusional at all.

Infinite supply of SAFE opiates, where people know what they're getting.

Sure some people couldn't handle it and would die, but it would be just like how some people can't handle alcohol in a responsible way.

The only way to stop the current "opioid crisis" a.k.a. the fentanyl crisis is more access to safer to use opioids.

Junkies gonna junk, might as well let themThe real problem is people who want to dictate to others how to live.  Junk food is inexpensive and widely available, but plenty of us aren't getting fat and enjoy a good cupcake from time to time.Well it certainly wouldn't make the opioid epidemic the US is currently facing any worse. I'd be interested to know why you think OP is delusional for this way of thinking.You can ask me, I know the institute, people getting their treatment there and people working there.Yeah if you can buy Heroin everywhere the chances are higher that you try it. I was very lucky that I could get opiates. It is not that easy for everyone, even if you have the desire to use.Yeah, I’m fine with Subs or methadone being ‘on demand’ essentially, without the need to pay a doc every month. Make it more like birth control.





 It probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to provide pharma-grade heroin, although in that situation more frequent engagement with providers could be encouraged. Even if it’s once a week to go pick up your supply and the provider has to ask, “are you ready to quit?” To which I can just say, “nope! I’d like 7 heroins, please!” And be on my way. Remove stigma and access barriers that cause dangerous behavior, let people lead normal lives and go from there. I WANT to taper off of subs at a reasonable rate because I hate the idea of needing to show up somewhere every 30 days. Eventually, many people will opt for some form of treatment.





And I’d add. Respect the addict to know something about detox. This current model of locked away for 3-7 days, removed from the outside world is abusive and unnecessary. Give me a 7 day supply of gabapentin, clonidine and a few benzos and I can detox myself at home while still going to work and being with my family. We’ve all done it, just with varying access to comfort meds.





Edit: regarding cost, every addict who is taken to jail on simple possession can be taken straight to one of the treatment hubs, enroll in the heroin program, means test a payment plan, and be on their way.It's proven that when you give virtually unlimited access of heroin to junkies, the tendency is for them to stabilize their doses and rather decrease them eventually, not take higher and higher doses until they die or can barely function.

Also, when heroin prescription was the go-to treatment for heroin addicts in the UK from 1926 to 1967, most addicts had jobs. When Dr. Marks started prescribing heroin and cocaine for hundreds of addicts in Liverpool in the 80s and 90s, many of them also became functional and kept jobs. So yeah, it's expected that most junkies would hold down jobs if given a safe and controlled amount of their drug of choice. Prohibition makes mantaining the habit almost like a secong job. Prescription kills that.They've have successful studies where its cheaper and more effective just give a script of heroin for junkies.  Surely some people would go off the deep end, but any more than now?  I wouldn't think so.  If nothing else it stabelizez the eviroment and variables which is always a good thing, esp with something that is already injerantly not stable lime opiates.

And the driving.  Well you would still get in trouble, just like you do now.It wouldn't be any worse than alcohol is now.  There are plenty of us who can handle both their drugs and drink just fine.  Some people aren't going to have any control over certain things, but that shouldn't be my issue to deal with.me (and a friend of mine) have been using for about 5 years straight now and we use about the same amount everyday. We both have jobs where we work with people who would notice if we were “zonked out” during working hours, and while we’re lucky enough to have good jobs to always have a weeks worth of stuff stocked away (in case something goes wrong with a source) if prices were to go down I honestly don’t think we’d start any more, we’d just have more money to buy nicer things in life.

I realize that not everyone is like us, but tons of people are already suffering under the current situation, surely some kind of semi-legalization would help. not saying you should be able to buy your opiates at costco, but allowing any addict to go to the doctor and be given opiates to manage their addiction would only improve things.Eh, yeah kinda.  But its not really the governemtns place to say.  Mixing, yeah.  Overdosing is pretty hard if your taking a script only.  And yeah, if your high and driving you shouldn't do that.  But not really related if opiates should be banned.It should be your right to put whatever you want into your own body.The violence would also greatly decrease as cartels and and gangs have less controlWhat happens when you use up all your pills for the month, with still 15 days left?What would this help exactly? Non-addicts and lesser-addicts would simply sell you theirs, recreating the black-market, and just dropping the prices. It would be nothing to find someone to sell you more than enough to kill yourself with in such a world. Not to mention it would create a whole lot of new addicts, since the only thing stopping more vulnerable teens in boring areas from recreationally trying opiates, is lack of easy access.Wait!?! This makes the idea worse, weirder and harder to enforce. You’ve created a new job though. Sober poor people turn into pill runners.




Not to mention the amount of tracking involved with this. Then the national database of pill buyers leaks and we have a data set of every addict in the country. Not to mention before it leaks the government has this info.Yes sorry BOT.The British did this, but the US did not have a hand in pushing opium in China. The US tiny involvement in the second opium war, was just about opening more trade, but not for opium.Legalization isn't the same thing as subsidizing it and selling it OTC.I don't believe for a moment that this would be the case in the US.

This is absolutely key. I'm at a point with my subutex script that I want to detox. I'm going to my doctors office to discuss comfort medications and while I could push through with work - I'm working with them to take time off to do it.Prohibition causes a lot of the issues addicts have to deal eith: price, inconsistent supply, purity, social stigma, incarceration/fines, etc.Then sucks for you.

I'm not saying you get it like a prescription. I'm saying you only get so much per day per month. Enough to nod off per day. No more.Yeah you can get that going for you in a lot of different places too, (just going in and trying to pay cash under the table). 

It I had to guess tho, the most feasible option would probably be going to Mexico and paying a doc at a pharmacia cash for a script and buying what you wany. If you have a legit script they allow you bring like a 30-90? I cannot recall, over the border with you, no hassle.What if it takes 150mg to even begin to nod?Hahahaha, maann that shit sounds so good to B true.. Fucking hate US opioid crisis.

Xanax galore. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Boyfriend addicted to heroin, Content: I’ve been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and I love him very much but his addiction has caused our sex life to be nonexistent. At first it was pretty normal, then it turned into once a month and currently we have not had sex in nearly five months. And in those five months He hasn’t even given me head. I’m really struggling and it has taken a toll on my self confidence. I am constantly worried that he doesn’t find me attractive anymore or is cheating on me. I’ve brought it up to him countless times but nothing has changed. I recently brought up possibly being in an open relationship and that really hurt his feelings but he still hasn’t made an effort to do anything. It’s not that I want an open relationship, I just want sex, I want to be desired. I find myself resenting him and being quick with anger and I don’t know what to do. I guess I am just looking for advice or maybe if someone can relate. I have no one that I can talk to about this and it feels really lonely., ups: 41, downs: 0I just read both posts of yours and without the slight differences in your story I would think you were my girlfriend, and this post made my face red. I don’t have much to offer but if I were to speak on his behalf I’d say he loves you a lot but the addiction has gotten to a point where it needs to be addressed with him or if you’re up to it his parents or whomever. He needs to go into treatment if he hasn’t already. But really you need to step back and analyze if YOU still want this because it’s going to be a long road. Even when I’m not using I don’t have much of a sex drive and when I’m using it’s of course nonexistent, but if my girlfriend were to suggest an open relationship I’d be absolutely infuriated, and the subject of sex seems to be your main point in this post so you really have to determine its importance in this relationship and to you, and if you think you can for be with him for reasons beyond sex. Speaking for him I will say he does desire you of course but he is just impotent.
Please just analyze your values and feelings and determine if you still want to be with him and ignore what I’m going to say next because I just feel the need to type it; Since you sound like my girlfriend I’d say please don’t leave for sex, there’s a lot more to the relationship than that and there is still love for every beautiful part of your body, but this dope has rendered him sensationally numb, he needs help for this to get better. I mean even if it’s getting testosterone like others have suggested.

I’d also like to add he doesn’t love heroin more than you, but now it’s part of his survival, and we go through what we need to survive.i can give your good advice. make him a dr appointment and tell them to have his test levels checked. he has low testosterone probably. this has nothing to do with him not finding u attractive he just lost his mojo.
   if u dont do this things wont change unless he stopps the heroin completely or goes on a buprenorphine program. other than that u can try to rub his cock and get him turned on. that works for me and my opioid tolerence is high.Opiates like heroin depress gonadal function... for men that means testosterone.  He may not be able to perform.  For females, like us,  our periods stop and we also lose our sex drive.  The other commenter who recommended that he get his testosterone levels checked is correct.  If they are super low, a Dr can Rx testosterone, either topical or IM.  That will make a world of difference in your sex life.heroin/fent/hard opiates makes a guy not care about getting laid. that's the sad truth. whenever i was doing it i'd rarely hit the dating apps. and when i did, often times i couldn't finish. but since you're together he should at least put in the effort now and thenTestosterone enanthate and dope is the vagina wrecking combination lol.  Might just need to get some injections if his doc will order them or get it like most ppl from the black market.  I was a beast when I would do a cycle and also be on dopeYou want some rough truth? One of the only things that has kept me and my fiances sex life alive has been meth or other stimulants like coke adderall would work great to. Wed plan sex once a week and I'll usually grab some kind of stim the day prior and do some that day, then the next day when it's time I usually do way more than just please  her. Aside from the fact that when I am high on heroin and have no sex drive and usually dont even like the idea of sex, if you use stimulants on heroin it will not only make him want and desire you, it will give him huge sexual libido. Stims help you get hard, amd the boy makes you last an extremely long time usually enough to make sure both parties get to finish! I know the idea of other drugs is scary but I just wanted to give you a bit of my own personal experience. Hope you guys get it all figured out!Shitttt I wish there was a girl somewhere begging me to have sex while I’m lit off opiates.. The fucking nerve of some people man...He has a high tolerance too. There’s been times where I’m in the mood and I start to touch him and he starts to get hard but instantly says “I’m too tired” and he’s not willing to do anything for me.Tell him to take some adderall or amphetamines for you occasionally. The heroin will make him last forever and the amphetamines will give him a pornstar sex drive. With this combination, he should be fucking you all night long. ;) I understand the perfect thing would be for him to abstain from drugs completely, but if he and you (not sure if you use or not) ARENT willing to give up drugs yet, this mixture can be very fun every once in a while. Good luck!I feel this from my own experience. My ex was lacking sex because of my low testosterone from opiate use. I still enjoyed having sex and can still get hard but I wouldn’t get off. Which didn’t bother me but it hurt her self confidence because she felt like she couldn’t get me off and also it started to hurt her physically because I could just keep going and going. My suggestion would be to see if he would be interested in using toys on you. I used to do this with my ex and she loved it but I will say that it’s still no substitute for real physical contact. I hate to suggest this because it almost never works but maybe toe the line of an ultimatum. See if he reacts to the possibility of losing you. If he doesn’t try to change now then he probably won’t ever. I’ve been the guy in the situation and it really sucks realizing when it’s too late that I was seriously depriving her of necessary physical contact. We were in love but after she finally left me, she was getting laid within a month. It hurt so bad but I finally realized that it was totally my fault. She tried so hard to get through to me and she did an amazing job of holding out as long as she could without cheating. It took a toll on her and I’ll probably never get over the pain I caused her.My ex and I both used, and both our libidos were barely there. Mine would ramp up around times I was supposed to start my period though. He ended up buying me a dildo and would use it on me while dirty talking and that would help a lot.Are you addicted to opiates too? I only ask as usually if you weren't the first thing to do would be get him sober. As opiates effect everyone different but one thing that is quite popular is the reduced libido and sex drive especially in men. The opiates see taking care of all those sex drives. Getting sober is the only way around that. Even maintenance like methadone can kill the sex drive.  Having been in a relationship where the man and woman were both using it was a drain as it effected my sex drive but not hers...so in turn the relationship ends badly unless both get sober imeSame thing happened to me. But my girlfriend actually cheated on me because of it. We’re still together but it’s been tough, but I’ve been forcing myself to have more sex with her and making myself more intimate with her so she doesn’t feel the need to get attention or affection from someone else...

I would tell him that if you don’t start having sex with me more I will go and find someone else to have sex with. I’m sure he will get mad but it’ll open his eyes. Wish my girlfriend did that before just doing it but that’s life of a addict. Not everything goes our way.Gotta ask, do you use?Tadalafil works for me when im on opis, but i never take em daily or somethingAs someone who used to be your boyfriend I can say in my experience, it's not just the lack of testosterone and that he wants to ravish you and just can't. I mean, the heroin took away my sex drive (though Oxy didn't for whatever reason) but I think a big part of it was the H is all you need. The average person needs sex, and fun, and relationships to be happy. Heroin fills all those needs. The only thing you need to keep going is more heroin, so for me at least it wasn't that I wasn't sexually interested in her perse, I just didn't even think about sex. I didn't need sex as a component in my life to make me content. If all you want is some head, and you don't care why he's doing it, even if you know he doesn't care and the only reason he's doing it is to make sure you don't cheat, then a solution can possibly be worked out. I would rather my gf not touch me than do something out of a sense of obligation, but that just might be me. Ultimately after putting up with me for so long and waiting for me to change, I could tell she was at her wits end, and I was tired of watching her suffer, so finally made the effort to switch to suboxone and  now Kratom. I had a moment of clarity she could be my forever and heroin could not, so chose her. He's going to need to want to improve by himself, though, and if you threaten to walk, you better follow through, because if you don't you'll just enable him further .That's a tough situation and I doubt it's going to change soon.  Women can pretty much point to a guy and say 'You, me, sex, now' and we'll comply.  Just find a guy and have your needs filled.  Your boyfriend is already cheating on you with that bitch heroin, so even-steven.DM me I'm beautifulbreak up with the junkieWell I'm sure many will agree that there is a third person in your relationship : lady brown. 
Sex is just the worst on smack. for most men it will allow us to pump for a long time but will not allow for climax.   The opposite of when withdrawing. He'll become very into sex and will be a two pump chump for a while. 

 Can't say I've heard of a woman with a man that uses and she doesn't use herself.  You must be very happy in the relationship , not counting the sex stuff.Honestly if he won't even please you in other ways that is lacking motivation on his part. Opioids stop me from ejaculating but all that means is that i pound my girlfriend until she's had three orgasms instead of one and that's why opioid users can actually make really great sex partners. The pleasure is still there just orgasm is hard to achieve. Some people can't get it up but if he won't touch you or give you oral he is just being lazy and obviously doesn't care enough about you, at least if you've made it clear to him that this is very important to you. I'm sorry you're having these problems you seem like a great supportive partner that he is lucky to have. Make it clear to him that it's very important to you and he can please yku in other ways than with his dick. If he doesn't do it then he just isn't relationship material right now which is also true of a lot of junkies. Even while addicted to heroin they shouldn't love heroin more than their partner. They might not be able to stop but their true love should be for you.Tell him to pop some viagra. He will wanna fuck you for days.Thank you for your input it truly means a lot because you’ve been in a similar situation. Our relationship is pretty great besides the sex issue. I want to be with him and that’s why I’m looking for advice regarding sex with opioid users. I just wish he would make more of an effort even if it’s just oral. The lack of effort is really what hurts my feelings the most because to me that feels like he doesn’t care. And I totally agree with the open relationship thing because if he suggested that to me I would be really upset as well but I made sure that he understood that I don’t want to be with anyone else I just want physical intimacy.Dude I literally saw the post and had a really bad feeling it was my girlfriend xD I wonder how many of us thought this immediately from the title lmao. Man great words truly inspiring way of summing alot of the struggle up for herIts really hard for us women when our man doesn't pay attention to us sexually.   I have been in this gals shoes at least once and its no fun being with someone who doesn't want to touch you.  In my case, at least, dude was depressed as fuck and couldn't hardly function. It made me feel very selfish that I wanted my needs met when he was in that state.. but we all have needs. Sex is a basic human need.. as is affection.Very kind and thoughtful advise my friend.This really helps. Thank you so much for your advice :)I fucking love when you talk science!! You do rock!Thank you !! Loli do the same to my gf. same story. hang jn thereThis and you can get benzedrex at walgreens over the counter it gets me horny all the time even while I was addicted to H and my sex drive was low. On benzedrex or any other amphetamine i cummed like 7 times in one day lol.I totally relate, sometime when we are intimate he won’t finish and I feel like it’s because of me. It’s hard to not think that but he does reassure me and that’s what’s important. And I think that’s part of the reason why we haven’t had sex because he gets embarrassed that he can’t finish and that it will hurt my feelings. The idea of using toys is a good idea (I’ll suggest that as Christmas gifts lol).I am not addicted to opiates and I’ve never even tried heroin. He’s been to rehab in the past and stayed clean for nine months but unfortunately started using again right before I met him.I can relate, although I haven’t cheated on him I do think about other guys. He’s told me that he doesn’t want to lose me because of the lack of sex but I don’t think he is realizes how much it’s affecting me.No, aside from occasionally smoking weed I don’t use anything.I relate to not wanting him to give me head out of obligation because I want him to want to do it. It’s hard because i want to be with him but I’m tired of waiting for him to make an effort.I feel you but I just could never cheat on him, I will leave him before it gets to that point.That’s a pretty mean thing to say :/Everything you said is exactly how I feel. I’ve made it really clear that ANYTHING would be great and would make me happy to see he’s making an effort. I think you need to talk some sense into my boyfriend lol.He needs to make you a priority. I'm an opiate addict and my testosterone levels are high and never had this issue. If he is choosing to get high and so high he is nodding out and not able to stay awake to please you sexually in some way then you need to see a sex counselor because it may be deeper than just the dope. Maybe take a break for a week or month and let him explore being without you and if the heroin is more important than find dick elsewhere... we all have needs and if you've expressed yours and he hasn't made the effort you know what you need to do don't delay the inevitable. Lots of codependent spouses/girlfriends waste years putting others and their addictions first and neglect themselves.Alright, my dick is fucked from a spinal injury and I'm often useless down there for weeks or months at a time, so I feel like I can chime in here. I am on kratom for chronic pain, and while I'm not on heroin or traditional opioids, I was on them in the past.    
    
I get that he's numb, but does he complete other tasks in your relationship? It sucks that it becomes a task for him looking at it that way, but I genuinely don't get why he can't make some compromise. The lengths of time you're going without physical intimacy are absolutely absurd to me. And my dick causes me nothing but pain at least 75% of my life.   
   
I don't get why fingers or oral aren't being done like you suggested. I understand it may not be something he has a drive to do, but that's the ultimatum I'd start with.    
    
It's very clearly a physical intimacy issue, and intimacy isn't just penetration exclusively. Cuddling, sexting, fingering, and the assorted stuff will make you feel like your boyfriend is attracted to you and wants you.   
   
If he is going to lose you, someone he supposedly (not trying to be rude here) loves, maybe he needs to check himself because this is fixable.Dude... i hope all our S/O didnt get together and write this. Cuz i thought the exact same thingYou’re right and I get it; so what we have is conflicting needs. It’s going to be a struggle as both needs are important, but both can be worked on, but not unless the addict puts in the most effort. I think the relationship has a 100% chance of being saved, but they need to work for each other, especially the addictThank you :) its like dirty talk to meGotcha, that's gotta be a rough situation. I feel for ya.Heroin addiction is one of the hardest things out there to overcome. Asking someone to give up Opioids is like asking someone to give water or oxygen in the sense That's what it feels like to an addict. I mean some people end up choosing heroin over their own kids which some people could spend their whole lives trying to fathom how that's possible and never could unless they became addicts themselves. My point being until a cataclysmic event or choice is foisted onto him to make him think about giving it up, you'll be waiting around forever, and even then sometimes that's not enough. A friend dying or a near death experience is enough for some people, for others, like me, that wasn't even enough. I'm not saying for his sake you should say it's you or the heroin, but for your sake, if you're done with wishing maybe you should for your sakeThe only thing I would maybe understand is if he's very depressed, when I am im never in the mood for sex but once a week should always be possible and there are other ways to please a woman than with your penis. I second the comment of the other guy that methadone could be helpful. Methadone is a great option because it provides you with a mild feeling of intoxication and keeps you stable throughout the day, you don't wake up in withdrawal or in a bad mood and you save a lot more money. Try and convince him to give it a try. Maybe show him the thread and see what he says. Honestly understanding girls like you are very rare and he is super lucky to have you. Usually either the girls are users too which causes all types of problems or they're absolutely against it and not too supporting. He doesn't know what he's got or is too depressed or addicted to care and that isn't fair to you. If he doesn't change after you make it clear to him how important this is for you then maybe you should consider some time apart at least. You seem amazing and deserve some fun time.I agree.  He has to understand that she has needs, too and if he does not fulfil those needs, she will find someone else who can.Thank you, it really means a lot to read all these kind comments :) @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Dear community,, Content: I just wanted to let everybody know how grateful I am to you guys and how much I appreciate you.  This is a throwaway account, but compared to the subreddits from my main account,  this is by far superior to any of those. 

For me, it's a sort of sanctuary,  or better described as a safehouse. I come here and I know I'll put down the phone, feeling much better than before. The reason for this is obviously people. I have yet to come across so many beautiful souls in one place.

You give great **advises**,  you **encourage**  and definitely **care**. There are some exceptions though that don't even worth mentioning or dwell upon. 

If you are like that in real life, which I'm sure you are, then those around you are lucky to have you as family/friends. Please don't ever change.

Thank you for being here!, ups: 14, downs: 0Happy nods/recovery<3 @@@@@@@@@@ Title: How do people get addicted to Oxy??, Content: Just had my first Oxy 10mg  then 2h later another 10mg, 4 tabs of Endone,IR.
Didnt have food for 2 hours prior. 


Effect is almost the same as codeine,less sleepy but still glued me to  my bed, there was no energy or euphoria at all other people get from it, my body was very relaxed, it made me thirsty and ended up with bad headache that I was contemplating taking paracetamol.

I dont know how people can like this, i guess its excellent pain killer but cant see any recreational value, in fact i prefer feeling of  Codeine

Anyone else had similar experience?, ups: 2, downs: 0It has different effects for different people. Some of us it makes us have energy and be warm and fuzzy and helps anxiety and pain and for me even helps my migrainesits weird how the first few times its really unappealing to be honest..but then something in your brain changes and you get tolerant to the sedating effects, even if its yrs later!

Example- when i was 16-17 i had dabbled in perc 10s here and there and some vikes from the dentist with my root canal issue and they helped compliment weed but weren't really anything mind blowing to me..

Then a few yrs later i dabbled in taking the 15s and 30s IR because they were so cheap and they were everywhere in fLa....i was mostly into coke and bars on the weekend and was an everyday weed/alcohol person...

But something changes after so much time goes by as your brain develops and it hits different..you get energized and it works like an anti depressant and anti-anxiety type drug as well.

That is what most people get addicted to IMO and of course, like all synthetic (pharma) drugs you build a tolerance rapidly and then develop the symptoms it supposedly prevents..

Sort of like taking xanax when you dont need it for a couple weeks straight and when you stop you get anxiety and panic attacks.

Heroin was never something anyone could really enjoy if they weren't already opioid tolerant in some way because its so sedating that most people don't find much recreational value to it...but if youre on the oxy's for a couple months then its a whole new ballgame.

Take this as a blessing in disguise and run the other way from this life, my man...trust.because opiates/opiods are addicting.....This is what it was like for me until the day my tolerance was high enough that I actually caught a buzz instead of feeling sick.   People who are opiate naive often have this experience.Be happy you don't see any recreational value in these opioids. 

Many others also don't understand the utility of opioids in people prone to substance use disorder. Most opioid users are actually just like you -- they aren't prone to developing long-term addiction issues with opioids. 

I hope you are more understanding of people who suffer from opioid use disorder, unlike many people who also "just don't get it." :)Maybe you didn’t have oxy— if you had oxy, then you should know. I’m so high I can barely type this, and I’ve been doing oxy for a while.

My point— **Dont base your decisions off of a one time experience**

Although, I encourage you not to go down this route.Lucky you, I was absolutely head over heels in love from the jump @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Fellow girl IV heroin users: do any of you know a lot about how heroin effects your period? I might be in some deep shit. Help :(, Content: Hey ladies :) I know there are probably more of us than I realize on this sub so hopefully someone can help me out with this. I desperately need it. 

**I know it's pretty common for a long term heroin IV habit to cause you to stop having a period. What I *dont* know and cant seem to find any info googling is if that also means you stop ovulating? Maybe I suck at googling.**

I recently started hooking up with a friend of mine and occasional running partner. He's awesome and all but...there's no fucking way I'd have a kid with him. Or anyone for that matter. I'm a junkie and (to each thier own but) I'm not bringing a child into this shit show. 

Anyway, we got a little too into it a few weeks ago and he didn't wear a condom...I know there are other huuge risks around that considering we're both addicts but that's for a different post (I'm getting tested soon). 

I've started feeling nauseous in the morning...but the new dope I've been getting can sometimes make me feel nauseous too..so..I dont know. I'm so broke rn I'm using pennies to put gas in my car so I cant afford a pregnancy test. Ive thought about lifting one but if I get caught that's lucky number 5 and a felony offense. I don't steal from stores anymore and I'm not proud I ever did. I dont want to tell my guy that I may be pregnant quite yet until I figure out how I feel about it so I'd rather not ask him to buy me a test. I'll bite the bullet and tell him though if everyone says that it's definitely possible to ovulate while shooting dope. 

It's funny because besides a very brief fling with someone else recently (shit, I sound like a hoe), I havent slept with anyone in like a year because my sex drive is so low from dope. Of course as soon as I do, boom, pregnancy scare. Fml. 

**Any knowledge or anecdotal info you guys have would be amazing. I'm kinda freaking the fuck out. Either way, keep your fingers crossed for me that I'm not pregnant** 

Thanks fam <3

**Edit :** I love this sub and I love you guys :) thanks to everyone for sharing so much of your experience and knowledge! There were even a few saints that offered to send me a pregnancy test. You guys are amazing.

So the general consensus is that some women ovulate without having a period and some don't while on heroin...and you have no way of knowing until you wind up pregnant. Fantastic. Being a woman is stressful af. 

I made an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow. I'll learn my fate then and deal with it however it goes. I'm also getting tested for Hep C and HIV. I treat myself like shit and play Russian Roulette with my life a lot. It's not good. I'm trying to curb that impulse but it's tough. 

I honestly care about the guy I'm in this thing with and he seems to care about me too so its not completely vile. I just cant imagine either of us being responsible for another human being. That's another level of recklessness that's beyond even me.

Anyway, thanks again opifam. You guys make me feel a lot less alone., ups: 182, downs: 0Op I will mail you a few tests of you want. They’re the simple strip types from amazon.Pregnancy and periods aren’t trustworthy. My friend had spotting for 6 months before she knew she discovered she was (6 months) pregnant.I wonder why this post is getting downvoted? I only care because it means fewer people will see this, which will make it harder for me to get the information I need. It's an honest question from someone that's been a member of this sub for years and needs help. This place used to be so supportive and helpful...I guess it's changed even more than I realized...I don't have any answers or nothing but fukin hell this sounds stressful af... dunno which is more stress, being a girl or being a user lol.

Hope you'll be okay though.The only thing I’ve found through a short google session is that opiates can and have effected ovulation ��‍♀️��‍♀️ also found out that if you hate having a period, methadone will make it stop. Who knew?Hey lady, I don’t know the answer to this one, but am curious, myself. And don’t worry about “sounding like a hoe,” we are all adults here. Also- you may have some luck checking out r/heroinheroines bc it’s the opiate sub for ladies. I wish you luck. My two cents would be, dont tell the guy unless you def are pregnant. If it’s just a scare, it might not be worth it to scare him too. If you are and need assistance/support, go for it bc at that point it’s kind of his problem too (sort of). No matter how it turns out, best of luck. I haven’t had a period all year but had one scare bc I was stealthed. I took the day after pill just in case.Bodies are weird. I wouldn’t go into this assuming that you’d stop ovulating until you’re a “woman of a certain age” lol. So this is what I have for advice:

Is there planned parenthood near you? A lot of them do free services and could run a pregnancy test for you and then at least you would actually know. That’s probably your best solution to find out the answer. 

Or if you can scrounge together a dollar and chance a lot of dollar stores sell pregnancy tests now, and while I assume they’re same as the ones from like a pharmacy you might want to get it checked out at PP either way. 

I hope that you get the answers that you want and need and soon!Female - former user.. IV heroin use will eventually stop your period. It does this by impeding gonadal function, ie.. hormones like progesterone, estradiol, FSH, Luteinizing hormone and testosterone, which are what triggers ovulation and the menstrual cycle.  With this being said, it is entirely possible to still ovulate and not have a period!!  


I have met a couple of women who had gotten pregnant while using IV heroin (no periods).  I would suggest that you get a blood test.

Edit-  The hospital can give you a test.  Planned parenthood does free ones.. check your local health  dept or DHS.All I can tell you is that I have been using for 20 plus year had hardly any periods along the way and have fell pregnant 3 times. So I guess u must still ovulate even if u dont have periods. Fingers crossed for u though I totally feel u.Hey,
I’ve read a lot about this because my period stopped for a long time while using H. I know that you absolutely *can* still get pregnant while experiencing opiate-induced amenorrhea, so keep up with the birth control, condoms, and the morning after pill, if it’s not too late!

I used to think I was safe, too, until I had a scare and did a ton of research.

Stay safe!

Edit: if you want me to try to dig up the sources where I read that heroin users experiencing amenorrhea can and do still get pregnant, just comment to this and let me know.

It was a medical journal (boring) article, if that matters.The short answer is yes, you can ovulate without menstruation. I’m not a girl, nor am I a health professional, but I recall a discussion in one of my anatomy classes that this (ovulation without menstruation) can occur in 2 ways

1. The egg gets fertilized (obviously if you get pregnant you wont menstruate)

2. I’m not certain on the details of this, but if your uterine lining is blocked/scarred then the lining wont shed properly so it will appear as though you aren’t having your ‘period’, but you will still have ovulated and can therefore get pregnant.

Either way I think the course of action to take would be the same, be smart, use protection, don’t fuck up.

Also you should probably go get tested for STDs/STIs, regardless of whether or not your friend thinks he has one, he may not be showing symptoms.Do you have a Planned Parenthood or similar women's health center in your city? They offer free pregnancy testing.

ProTip: Google Scholar is your friend when it comes to shit like this.Maybe cross post to r/heroinheroines?You can get a test at walmart for like 88 cents. My wife took one and now I have a 15 month old sonI think you’re gonna be okay!! I was legit in your exact same shoes- I’m clean now and still haven’t gotten normal functional lady parts. The body knows for the most part when the time isn’t right!Every body is different. My period was whack when I was using. Once I got on methadone (7/14) it took about 9 months for it to be completely normal.

About 24 months in on methadone I ended up getting Nexplanon which I absolutely love and recommend; I literally just got my 2nd one (they last 3-4 years; my first one lasted 3 but this second one will last 4 ) installed last month. The only thing that sucks is I don't get a period at all anymore but it's due to the BC. And luckily I'm not in a relationship anymore so I don't have to worry.Been in your shoes and most of the time it’s a fluke- especially if your body is lacking vitamins... if you haven’t had a period for over a year then I’d say take a test just to be sure because it is possible. I’ve had friends that thought for 6 months that they weren’t pregnant and found out after it was too late to abort. CPS got involved it was all a really sad occurrence.. hope you figure it out girl best of luck to you in these times of tremulous nature.Girl, take a test. Yes heroin can stop ovulation (and therefore your period), but you don't want to risk not knowing, especially if you've been using. You can absolutely still get pregnant while you're using.Just a heads up if it happens again in the future, give planned parenthood a call the next day for Plan B. Pretty sure they can give that to you at low/no cost if you qualify. Good luck!!I think the thing with ovulating and periods is that its going to be different for every woman taking heroin. My own personal experience was that I stopped using contraception with my boyfriends ( a few different ones over 18 years of iv use, I then got clean abroad,  came back, fucked my boyfriend and immediately got pregnant.  I didn't do a pregnancy test for 3 months cos I just didn't believe I could get pregnant.  Unfortunately,  I started smoking it again towards the end of the pregnancy , and have been continuing to fight my habit for another 11 years. During all those years of iv heroin use, I always had periods,  but was obviously not ovulating.  However,  I've heard of plenty of women who have become pregnant while still using.  In the UK we can hand in a urine sample to any doctors surgery or sexual health clinic  and they will do a free pregnancy test. Try googling for your area,  I realise you're in the USA but still,  they must look after some basic health care needs,  and possible pregnancy will surely be one of them. This situation will not go away and the longer you leave it, the less options you will have.  Good luck, I hope you get the result you are after. XI'm a IV user aswell so sorry that's not going to save u  . That's terrible that ur state banned abortions fucking ridiculous what if had been rape do they still expect you to have it crazy.
I was lucky because I got a water injection at the same time and when  i went to get antibiotics they told me a was pregnant else I would of missed the cut off for a termination cuz I didn't know I wasYour putting alot of stress on yourself right now which in itself will make your period late.you can actually psych yourself into having pregnancy symptoms no joke lol.  It's good you made an appointment chances are your not cause your causing so much havoc it your body your not gonna get pregnant I actually stopped getting my period for months when I was using heavy.they sell $1 dipstick pregnancy tests at all the dollar stores now, they work just as good as the $15 ones.All dollar stores have tests..scrape up a $1 and run over..Lost a shit load of weight due to various reasons, didn’t get a period for over 7 months. Had unprotected sex around my ovulation time ONCE. Got pregnant.It was a bit difficult at the time and it comes up now and again but I know I made the right decision.  I'm mean what kid want a junkie for a parent. That's what u have to tell yourself its completely rational. Try not to work urself up until u know for sure. I've had to make the decision 3 times and it's not a pleasant procedure. Finally sorted myself with a implant. One of those times I had a coil and the other 2 I used condoms so I was really unlucky. Hopefully ur not as unlucky as me but if you are trust that u know ur own mind and what's best for u personally. Good luckMy homeboys girl just recently had a baby and they were heavy heroin iv users so yea it’s possible to get preggo whole shooting dope.Get a one dollar pregnancy test from the dollar treeOp I hope everything goes smoothly �

Update us pleaseMy habit has gone on so long that my period stopped for a while, then started back up again 1x/month as if I had quit dope. It’s weirrrrdddd....

Edit: and no, I did *not* get pregnant or give birth during that time “period” lmao (pun... not intended? Lol I need sleep) 

OP, I have my fingers crossed for ya! Kudos for at least being smart about how you’re moving forward and taking responsibility for yourself. Good shit.I've been an on and off IV user for about two years. I haven't had a period in over a year but around the same time each month I'd get my period the 12th to the 15th I do get cramping and bloating and pms-y. I'm guessing this might be me ovulating? I'm sorry I can't be much for help. Best if luck to you love. I hope everything works out as it should. Maybe if you are pregnant it will help you turn yourself around (that is if you want to give it up, no judgement if you don't. Lord knows I'm not ready to) and props for you knowing yourself and NOT wanting to put a child through the difficulty of being a child of an addict. Xo your in my thoughts.Hey so I think I had responded to a comment of yours in the past about not having a period, saying to google opiates and hyperprolactinemia. The medical article someone else linked seems to propose that opiates may actually interfere with certain horomones that would regulate your period and ovulation, but I didn’t see anything about prolactin in particular so I’m not sure if this would be included or if they’re talking about something totally different.

Either way, I learned that I had high prolactin when I went to the hospital for an unrelated issue and told them my last period was in 2015. Apparently opiates mess with the system that inhibits prolactin (I think it involves dopamine somehow) and causes increased secretion of the hormone. Hyperprolactinemia does cause infertility, and apparently breastfeeding is actually used as a successful method of birth control by some people who don’t want to get pregnant again right away, due to the high prolactin causing infertility. 

I’m not super clear on how exactly the opiates interfere with the system that regulates prolactin, or how hyperprolactinemia causes infertility. And if there are other ways that opiates can stop menstruation, then that makes it even harder to say what’s going on in your case. Maybe check if you have any other symptoms of high prolactin like decreased libido, galactorrhea, facial hair etcHave you heard of Project Prevention? They will pay you to get long term birth control or even get your tubes tied, if you want.Hi, I sent you a pm (not sure if I did it right)Gosh, I couldn’t imagine being a girl and being stuck in my addiction loop. That’s just adding a whole new layer to things... 
Hang in there kid!All I have to say is if you are pregnant please think long and hard about your options. Abortion is not always the wrong choice nor is adoption. If you truly feel like you cannot care for a child, please do not try to. I saw my ex-junkie friend become overwhelmed by the life of a stay at home mom and turn back to the drugs she previously quit for her son. Do what is right for you but most importantly what is right for the future of that child. Good luck and much love, friendIf you catch it early you can perform an at home abortion (using some pills) your local or regional reproductive health justice group can help ya access these. If you’re near Appalachia I can help more specially.Hello, I just wanted to say I believe everything will work out okay for you. You're definitely not a hoe or any of those other rude words that should never be used to describe anyone who chooses to enjoy their sexuality.

From what I've just read yes heroin (and even other opiates) can affect your menstrual cycle and also your ovulation cycles because it blocks certain hormones from being produced properly which stops the egg from descending. I'm not a doctor or anything but what I understand is that prolonged use will stop your cycle and it would stop you from getting pregnant so if you weren't haveing a period before you were sexually active the chance are very low. 
Also their is this thing where your brain can trick your body into thinking you're pregnant so you end up getting symptoms and stuff. So maybe if you're supper worried you're tricking your body, False Pregnancies (Pseudocyesis) is what it's called.

You got this! Happy Holidays! ✌If I get pregnant while using I'd not think twice to terminate the pregnancy. Good luck hunYour local health department  an pregnancy test you for free. 

Also you wouldn't "feel" pregnant the day after intercourse. It takes like 48 hours for a fertilized egg to start it's journey to your uterus and another 3 or 4 days for it to implant. Most woman don't feel symptoms till after their first missed period.I have heard of the Asian pregnancy test.

Ok, so you insert an unresolved rubik's cube into the vagina and if it comes out solved, there's a tiny Asian inside your body.Go to planned parenthood.  Its freeGo to a free health clinic and get a test.. Look for womankind or planned Parenthood or just a county health clinic...they could also answer your questions...but if you are pregnant is abortion an option? Just asking cause if you ask about the using prior to them testing you and find out you are and wanna keep the baby then get ready to deal with that shit show too..dfacs all up in your life and potentially losing custody at birth. .just some things rk consider. I'm pro choice so either way IDC what u do just wanted the info there.This might be the wake up call both of you needed. Something to get clean for. I know if I would have had a child, I'd have quit everything long ago. But alas, it never happened and I've been in the methadone clinic for over 13 years. I just recently got arrested for my 1st time since 2006 for DUI, but it's a bogus charge because the only reason I was arrested was because I failed the field sobriety test due to having an issue with my legs (I was actually on my way to the ER when I got pulled over and was diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis the next day). But admittedly, I have been abusing my take-homes for years. This DUI is my wake up call. Hopefully I beat it and can move on and change for the better.  I truly believe things happen for a reason.opiates heavily affect men’s testosterone levels from long term use so i can’t see why it wouldn’t affect females, i really hope OP gets the answers cuz i’d be freaking out tooIt’s posts like this I thank my lucky stars I was born with a meat rocket instead of a ham wallet.Good luck � and keep us updated �I'm a dude but they had pregnancy tests for like a dollar at my local Walmart.  Although pennies for gas may mean that doesnt help.  Sorry, felt compelled to chime in lol.  Glad everyones been so helpful.  Addicts are more generous than any other group of people I know besides just others that have been through really tough problems.My home girl didn't have her period and she still got pregnant and had a kid when she was usingJust get a pregnancy test,only a couple of dollars here and you can get them in supermarkets.
I think for the peace of mind a negative test will provide is well worth kt.
Maybe tests are really expensive where your at,is there no free well woman clinics,again one more benefit of public health system we have here,contraception ,everything.
I really hope it works out for the best,take care.Holy shit dude hope you not preggo and just be careful in the future! Raising a tiny human is life changing but yea you gota be somewhat stable. Anyways planned parenthood? They do tests for free.

Best of luck OP!Maybe Tracy would be able to help (at least for the future) with a harm reduction pack? I can't tag from my app?
Also, I am in the South as well and there are pregnancy tests at Dollar Tree.Hey girl just wanted to let you know I'm hoping everything works out for you luv. Whatever way things go, the decision you make will be the right decision. 

I only get a few periods a year too. They always come back. Good luck and lots of love from "just another one of us" xxoxoMy wife doesn't get her period for months and months. She's actually gone over a year while using without getting it. Still take a pregnancy test though.Unusual periods seem to be a very common symptom among opioid addicted females on reddit.Good luck with everything. Take care of yourself. If you need to vent I will gladly listen. If you want advice i will try my best☺.Best of luck tomorrow, sending hugs your wayDollar general has the same type of tests for just a dollar. Idk if your area has a dg, but worth looking into.Don't wanna sound rude but what about cutting your daily dope intake slightly for a few days in order to save enough money to buy a pregnancy test? This shouldn't send you into any uncomfortable state since pregnancy tests aren't that expensive compared to a dope habit.

Especially since you said 'I honestly care about the guy I'm in this thing with' and 'I'm not bringing a child into this shit show.'

Ok, maybe I want to sound a bit rude, but a pregnancy test is just a few dollars, 10-20$ for the more expensive ones. And I'm totally aware they are not 100% trustworthy, but if you're freaking out like you said, the money is better spent on a pregnancy test instead of dope to calm your nerves for just a little bit. Otherwise you're just moving closer and closer to 'another level of recklessness that's beyond even \[you\].'I just recently found out after being on a high dose of Methadone for over the oast three years that opioids can affect your period. I really thought I was in menopause because I never went to the damn doctor.  I went from being on 160mgs everyday to 20 mgs and once I hit 30 my period returned after not having one for 3 years.  Went to the gyno and had a full check up and all kinds of lab. Even the scrape test and all is good.  The doctor told me my very first visit that opioids can definitely make your period non existent.     I learned something new.Yep and whatever you continue to tell yourself in order to be a hip rite I’m sure you will.  You can’t fathom someone doing something for themselves yet continuing e to be extremely shallow, selfish and judgemental yourself. 

I don’t explain myself to the likes of you because I know it would be wasted on someone that won’t listen because they think they know better and are just used to lying to themselves and calling it the truth they don’t know the difference anymore.  You might view it as wasted I obviously get something out of it since I’m such a jerk there’s no way I’d be doing this other than my own amusement. 

Keep doing what you have been, keep making the same mistakes over and, keep not listening to people because you do t like hearing it and you’ll keep being in the gutter.They sell them at the dollar store for a dollar.  Just go stand next to your car at a gas station and bum a dollar from someone. Or two dollars for taxes.  SmDon’t do heroin lmaoIsn't the morning sickness thing more of a movie myth that's not really true? I wouldn't be too worried. 

Maybe you could go to a doctor to ask if he could do a test but idk I'm just guessing here no personal experience at all.

Good luck and stay safe.You seem like a real sweet heart. Any man would be lucky to shoot up and then raw dog you.Well if you sound like a hoe then..the glove fits 

Seriously if you are going to be the least bit responsible about something do it when concerting bringing another life onto this planet. 

You seem to realize you are in no condition nor have the ability to take care of a child so be responsible. There are free pregnancy tests that are offered by non profits and similar. I’m not trying to knock you but if you could read what you type as someone besides yourself I have a hard time imagining you would think any different. 

It takes 5 seconds to prevent a lifetime of pain and regret/sorrow. Just because you haven’t made good life choices doesn’t mean you can’t start. 

And eventually you will become fertile again but pregnancy isn’t something you should ho-hum guess and shrug about 

There are resources available to help broke people.  You just have to not be to stupidly proud to ask.

If a dude doesn’t want to wear protection then don’t spread your legs for him the kids should be the least of your worries if you are a needle user. 

Telling a guy no is a lot easier than explaining to your grown child years later that he got hep-c or worse because momma didn’t want to inconvenience the sperm donor.  Isn’t it easier to use protection than go have an abortion?  I totally understand that opiates mess with your judgement and decision making but at some point if someone wants anything to change they can’t use being high as a convenient excuse to be impulsive and reckless.

There are definite signs you can tell if you are pregnant after six weeks but you need to be coherent and know your body, cause it will change a lot. Bigger droopier boobs etc etc but being on the smack will keep you from noticing most anything.Aw, thanks so much homie! That's so, so cool of you to offer <3 I actually just found a clinic near me that offers free tests. I made an appointment for tomorrow. I'm terrified but I need to bite the bullet and find out what I'm dealing with..hopefully nothing but a little nausea from the dope...Thanks for replying :)

I know the correlation is weak at best. Just because I dont have a period doesnt mean no ovulation too. I was just wondering if anyone knew or had read that heroin *also* stops ovulation? Or if it doesnt have any effect on ovulation and only effects whatever causes the uterine lining to shed (*gag*).Possibly bot or people who are just dicks. Good luck by the way. For anyone reading this post down the line, I'd be willing to send anyone a pregnancy test if you are ever in this situation.Glad to see this post isn't being downvoted at the time of this comment, your post and your question are exactly what this sub is supposed to be here for: help and safety for other users. People can be assholes, but this sub has always felt more communal than any other to me, and I'm glad that the majority of us seem to be supportive.

As for your problem, I unfortunately don't have much in the way of advice or anything that hasn't already been offered. But I hope this is just a small scare and that everything works out. Stay safe, yo.Lol, it is stressful homie. I mean I'm fully aware it's my own damn fault but this is what I do..act impulsively, get myself into a world of shit, freak out, then somehow weasel my way out of it by some crazy fucking miracle. Rinse, repeat. One day I'm going to run outta miracles but I'm hoping this isn't the time...

It's loads of fun being me /sAnd thanks for the well wishes btw. I'm really worried and it's nice to hear something kind :)Interesting, if you dont mind me asking, what did you google to find that? I'm shit at searching. I know dope stops periods for some women but didnt know methadone does too. *The more you know* 

I wish suboxone had the same effect lol. Unfortunately, the few times I've been sober and on it for MAT I've started having my period again. So far, I've always relapsed before it has had a chance to level out and become regular again though :/ so I havent had a regular, full period in over 5 years...

Thanks for the reply :)That's interesting, I've been on Methadone for many years and never has it affected my period. Only thing that has actually is my IUD. Interesting that others have had that experience. Thanks for the info!Yeah, I'm getting nasty messages calling me everything under the sun but "hoe", "whore" and "slut" seems to be thier 3 favorite insults. I knew it was coming so I'm trying not to let it bother me. 

I don't plan on telling him unless I'm sure and even then, I'm not sure I want to tell him if I am...I dont know how I feel about that though. I'm torn because part of me feels he has an equal right to know but at the same time, he's the type that would want me to keep it. Theres no way I'm ever considering that..so why put him through that heartbreak and in turn, make it harder for me to stick to that choice and go through with it? We were friends first so I know him pretty well. My fear is that he'll start talking about getting sober again so we can be a family and all of that. I'm not confident enough in either of us to get sober and stay that way for any real amount of time. Entertaining that idea is just setting everyone involved up for disappointment. Maybe that's cynical, but..I think I'm just being realistic. 

>I haven’t had a period all year but had one scare bc I was stealthed. 

What's stealthed mean? I've never heard that before. I think I know..but I hope I'm wrong...They are weird, aren't they? I live in the conservative south who has been at war with planned parenthood, unfortunately. I did find one free clinic nearby and made an appointment for tomorrow, yikes. Whatever it is, I'll figure it out. I always seem to somehow lol. Thanks for the well wishes fam <3Damn, yeah I'm seeing that's the general consensus. I've made an appointment with a free clinic for tomorrow. I'm going to get tested for Hep C and HIV too if they offer it. I'm already doing something terrifying tomorrow..might as well go all in. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I was planning on going into an inpatient facility this week to give getting sober another try. Not gonna happen if I'm pregnant. Anyway, thanks for the reply :)Damn, alright well then that tells me theres at least a chance I'm still ovulating then. I'm going to look for a clinic that'll give me a free pregnancy test. There have got to be some, even in the conservative south east....

And thanks for the well wishes. I'm going to need it if the test is positive. The state I'm in has all but banned abortions so I'd have to travel out of state to get one if that's what I decide. Yikes.Btw, I'm curious what your ROA is when using? I know IV use has more negative physical effects so I wonder if it does more damage, making it less likely I still ovulate..

Thanks again, girl :)Hey girl! You're awesome, thanks so much for sharing. Every reply so far confirms what you said, lol. So you don't need to go through digging up the article, thanks so much for offering! I have appointment for a free pregnancy test at the city clinic so...I'll find out tomorrow. Yikes. And you stay safe out there too! <3Yup already on it. Like I said, i treat myself pretty poorly. I've been suicidal off and on for years but am trying to turn a corner. It's something I'm working on and this mistake has set me back a lot. It'll be even worse if I am in fact pregnant. Anyway, I made an appointment with a free clinic for tomorrow to get tested for Hep C and HIV as well as the pregnancy test.Wow, thanks for the info. You're like a google ninja lol. Basically the consensus in both reports are: some women ovulate without a period on heroin, some dont. And there's essentially no way to know which one you are unless you wind up pregnant lol. Fantastic.

And no planned parenthood near me because I'm in a ultra conservative southern state, unfortunately. It sucks. I did find a free clinic that's similar and made an appointment for tomorrow. They dont do abortions there but I can at least find out what's up and take it from there. I'm crossing my fingers it's the dope making me nauseous. Thanks again homie! <3Didn’t know this sub existed. Thanks for sharing :)Omg, how'd I forget about this sub? Thanks for the reminder! <3Whaat? Are they really that cheap?! I went to cvs and they were all $10 and up. It was hard not to just boost that shit but I didnt. I'm trying really hard to curb my junkie impulses. It's just, how can something you pee on be so damn expensive?

Anyway, thanks for the reply :) I have an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow so I'll find out then. Yikes.

Congratulations on the baby btw! :)I made an appointment at a free clinic just in case. They offer free pregnancy tests so no harm no foul if I'm not pregnant but if I am at least I'll know and can make a choice about what to do.Nexplanon FOSHO! I got the 5 year Norplant (back when that was available) at the Health Department, in different Southern state at no charge, then when that ran out I got Nexplanon which is 3+ years.Yeah, I'm not super healthy rn so I'm def lacking vitamins. I'm underweight now and havent had a full, regular period in..like 3 years. Yikes. Getting tested tomorrow at the free clinic. If its positive, I'll have to find a way out of my state to a less conservative one for an abortion. I cant go through that and I cant put an innocent child through it either. I dont know what itll do to me mentally but it's the right thing to do in my eyes. I shouldn't be a parent. Thanks for the well wishes love!I have an appointment tomorrow at a free clinic in the city so I'll find out then..I'm so nervous I feel like I'm going to puke. Anyway, thanks for the reply :) I appreciate it!Yes! I wish I would've thought of that at the time. I was strung out and not thinking but I'm working on making better choices. Thanks for the reply :)Yeah the new law is all kinds of fucked up.  It completely removes all agency from women and places the importance of the fetus over her life and wellbeing. Like we're incapable of making that choice for ourselves so they feel they should step in and make it for us. It's Orwellian and fucking wrong. 

I'm glad fate intervened for you and you were able to make a decision for yourself about what to do. I'm terrified of having to make that choice. Was it tough for you mentally or emotionally? I know its different for every woman I'm just trying to get a feel for what to expect afterward, if that is something I have to do. Because if I'm pregnant then I'm definitely getting an abortion. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to have it then give it up for adoption and keeping it is completely out of the question so...Son of a bitch. That's word for word what happened to me without the pregnancy....yet? What'd you end up doing about it? If you dont me askingThanks love, I will :)Really? Dude, I'd get my tubes tied tomorrow if I could. I thought I'd want kids one day but..I honestly dont think I  should ever have kids. Getting my tubes tied would completely remove the risk and give me one less disaster to worry about avoiding. I'll check it out. Thanks so much!I'm *definitely* in agreement with you on that. It's going to be really fucking hard but it's the right thing to do.Oh, it's been weeks since our slip up happened. We were pretty blasted at the time too so I didn't really think much about it afterward. Then I started feeling nauseous and it came back to me. It was an, "oh God. No." moment for me. I'm stupidly impulsive and reckless. I'm hoping the damage this time is minimal. 

And I made an appointment at a free clinic for tomorrow so I'll find out soon what's up. I'd have to go to a different state for an abortion so I'm praying that's not the case.Lmao, borderline racist but I still laughed. Thanks for that, I needed it :)There isnt one anywhere near me. Ultra conservative southern states be like that.Already ahead of you :) I made an appointment for tomorrow at a free clinic. Abortion is definitely the way I'd go if it turns out I'm pregnant. It absolutely breaks my heart and it's probably going to fuck me up for a bit but I'd rather suffer that devastation than bring a child into my shitshow of a life. No kid deserves me as a parent lol. Logistics of actually getting one is scary because I'm in an ultra conservative state and abortion is illegal here after 6 weeks. Which is absurd. Who tf knows they're pregnant before 6 weeks?! Anyway, I'll figure out a way to get to a more tolerant state if need be. I won't go the back alley abortion route or anything. Lwts hope that's not the case tho :/I definitely see where you're coming from and that thought crossed my mind, for sure. But then reality hit me. I've gone to 9 different inpatient rehabs. A bunch of out patients, detox countless times, groups, therapy, etc, trying to get sober. I've failed every time so far. I'm not saying its impossible for me to get sober. Its definitely possible and I'll keep trying until I find something that works or I'm dead but I just cant in good conscience gamble the wellbeing of a child on my ability to get sober. Those stakes are way too high and then if I fail, it's not just me anymore that suffers the consequences of relapsing...it's an innocent child that didn't choose this shit. I just cant do that, you know?

Sometimes things just happen and they're not fate they're just mistakes. I need to believe that's what's happening for me.I got a lot of good answers. I made an appointment with a free clinic to take a pregnancy test tomorrow before I read that I could just get a test from the dollar store. I just checked pharmacies and didnt think about going there. Apparently, I'm the only one that *didnt* know that lol.

Now that I know, I'm gonna swing by dollar tree when they open tomorrow and cancel the clinic trip. I scrapped together enough change to cover two strips...just incase. Anyway, most people were really helpful. 

I'm trying not to freak out too much. I got some fire dope so I've been nodding pretty hard all night, which is exactly what I needed right now. Thanks for being concerned :)Thanks ducky <3Thanks doll <3I would, but I barely stay well right now as it is. I'm getting by on 2 points a day and stay a little sick most of the time. I dont really have anything I can cut anymore, ya know? Things are just really lean but they'll pick up, I hope. I scraped together change to go to the dollar store tomorrow first thing and snag some pregnancy test strips. 

I'll do whatever I have to based on that....I'm definitely not having a baby. I'll go back to flying a sign and put together money for a trip to Tennessee for an abortion if it comes to that. I just hope it doesnt :/Cool man, I'm not reading your comments soo...keep shouting into a vacuum. If it makes you feel better, I guess that's all that matters, right? It's funny that you *still* think you know me better than I know me. I'd love to hear some details about my life, and the "same mistakes that I keep making over and over"? What are those exactly? Since you know so much about me and my life and what I have and haven't done. Please enlighten me, lol. 

So since you *don't* know those details...or anything about me...the advice you're insisting on shoving down my throat are based on broad assumptions your making about a tiny sliver of information about me you got from a single moment of 27 years of my life. But you're right man...you know *exactly* what I need to do based onaa that. Your arrogance is astounding. I'm done now btw. I've got a lot of stuff to do today and you're not worth any more energy.Oh I just read your update.  I will say a little prayer for you that it all works out in your favor!You're commenting in an opiate sub, "dont do heroin"? *lmao*Morning sickness does actually exist! Some people don’t have it as bad as others though! :)Morning sickness is a very real and gross part of early pregnancy for many women.I've never been pregnant before so I haven't experienced it first and but several of my girlfriends have gotten pregnant over the years and most of them complained about "morning sickness" even though they didnt just feel nauseous in the morning. It was usually of and on all day. Which is kinda how I've been feeling. It's worse in the morning but also comes and goes throughout the day. Smells are really intense right now for some reason. Like, crazy sensitive. I'm like a bloodhound, lol. It's weird. I dunno. I've always been a little sensitive to smells. Anyway, thanks! Be safe too homie <3Oh it’s definitely a thing! I was also having no periods (and was on birth control) but I got awful morning sickness. Not just in the mornings, either.  Sometimes acute nausea, and sometimes I’d just wake up, yawn, and vomit all over my pillow and stare at it in dismay for a while. 

Different for everyone though.There it is. I knew there would be at least *one* judgemental prick that would show up and call me a slut because I had sex with a close friend of mine and, one of those times, didn't use protection. It was a reckless choice not having him wear a condom. I was pretty clear about that from the jump. So no need to slut shame me. 

Also, what the fuck are even talking about here:

>Seriously if you are going to be the least bit responsible about something do it when concerting bringing another life onto this planet. 

>You seem to realize you are in no condition nor have the ability to take care of a child so be responsible. There are free pregnancy tests that are offered by non profits and similar. I’m not trying to knock you but if you could read what you type as someone besides yourself I have a hard time imagining you would think any different. 

Where in my post did I say anything about wanting to be pregnant? Or anything about keeping it if I am? Why are lecturing me like this post is about me wanting to keep a pregnancy that I'm not even sure exists yet? 

I wouldn't have posted this if I wasnt concerned about the situation and confused about what to do. If you missed the part where I said I'm literally counting pennies to pay for gas. I'm jobless and essentially couch surfing. Picking up a pregnancy test isnt something I thought I could afford because I wasnt finding anything less than $10. I live in an ultra conservative state. There aren't any planned parenthoods anywhere near me. I did find a free clinic though to at least take a test. They dont perform abortions there tho and because the one time I had unprotected sex with him was more than 6 weeks ago..it'd be illegal in my state to have an abortion for me now. I'll find a way though. 


>It takes 5 seconds to prevent a lifetime of pain and regret/sorrow. Just because you haven’t made good life choices doesn’t mean you can’t start. 

Thanks for chastising me. I dont already feel bad enough about myself so I definitely needed the extra kick while I'm down. Nicely done. 

>And eventually you will become fertile again 

That's not how women work. Abortions dont cause you to be infertile. Unless something goes terribly wrong. 

>but pregnancy isn’t something you should ho-hum guess and shrug about 

Yeah, me spending time researching on my own and not finding any conclusive answers then taking time to write this post then time to reply to every single person that was kind enough to help is definitely me being ambivalent about the situation. You caught me.

>If a dude doesn’t want to wear protection then don’t spread your legs for him the kids should be the least of your worries if you are a needle user. 

>Telling a guy no is a lot easier than explaining to your grown child years later that he got hep-c or worse because momma didn’t want to inconvenience the sperm donor. Isn’t it easier to use protection than go have an abortion? I totally understand that opiates mess with your judgement and decision making but at some point if someone wants anything to change they can’t use being high as a convenient excuse to be impulsive and reckless.

How's the air up there in your ivory tower in the land where no one makes mistakes and everyone is perfect? Bet it's nice. Down here in reality it's a little more complicated than where you're from so let me explain what it's like here. 

I already have said countless times that I'm extremely reckless and irresponsible. The reason for my behavior is rooted in the fact that I have bipolar disorder and PTSD. My impulse control is non existent but its something I constantly fight against. I said in my post that I treat myself poorly. I know this. Its something I'm also working on but not having much luck with. It's also something that I'm constantly suffering consequences from so no need to tell me. I feel the pain of my stupid actions every fucking day. 

It's not  being high that makes me reckless. I'm high *because* I'm reckless. I've been to 9 different rehabs. I've attempted the 12 steps 4 times. All of this while being unmedicated for bipolar disorder because we havent found a combination of meds that work for me yet. I cant explain how frustrating it is to know that I'm fucking up and actively trying **so hard** to not be the way I am but constantly failing. Its exhausting and makes me feel desperation, anger and despair.

None of these are excuses but until I find medication that can help me get out of my own way, I dont think I'm capable of being fully functional. Anyway, I dont know why I'm bothering to reply to you. You just hit a bunch of my buttons and I couldnt not say something. 

By the way, this is a sub for drug addicts. In case you weren't aware. If you're going to lecture every person that's made a bad decision, you're going to stay pretty busy...maybe you should save yourself some time and fuck off to a different sub.Wow. This response. Are you even serious? Or are you just an asshole? OP found a free clinic and she expressed her understanding of the seriousness of her situation. Maybe try and realize she was reaching out for support and not hate after she made a mistake. I guess you don’t know what that’s like huh?Yeah, I kinda expected to get torn apart for posting this here but I needed to talk about this and ask questions to people that *may* understand where I'm coming from and what it's like. The responses were overwhelmingly kind. The negative ones though...are rough. You should see the awful shit in my inbox. I underestimated how terrible the negative responses would make me feel. 

The kind responses and the offers like yours to send a pregnancy test have been really amazing though. I'm trying to focus on those instead :) I've got an appointment at a free clinic tomorrow. The consensus was that it's possible that I'm pregnant even without a period so better safe than sorry. Thanks for the reply homie. Stay safe :)You just accurately describe, in a few words,  what life is like for a dope user. Wish you all the best, pregnant (hopefully not) or not. Take care out there xXI tried several phrases but the one that was a score was : does heroin stop ovulation

And you’re welcome. I hope that you get it figured outIt's usually the drop in body fat % and/or weight that stops your period not the heroin itself.It’s your body and your decision. Whatever you think is best, since you know him well. My best friend hid a terminated pregnancy from her bf at the time and it worked out all for the best. You just do what is best for you. 
And fuck all those people calling names, they are clearly too immature to understand that adults have sex. There’s nothing immoral or indecent about it. 
Stealthing is when the guy takes the condom off without you knowing. I caught it, but it was already too late and he def got some thrusts into me bare. It’s essentially sexual assault since I did not consent to it. I freaked out after and took plan b bc I didn’t want to risk any pregnancy.
Good luck and keep me posted! I had an abortion a few years ago, if you need anyone to talk to about it, PM meGood luck! And this absolutely could just be scare and your fine. You’re doing a lot of things that could cause similar pregnancy symptoms and stress also makes weird things happen. So I will absolutely cross my fingers for you that you get the outcome you want. I would definitely want an update after tomorrow if you feel comfortable doing that. 

And that’s why I asked if there was one nearby because the state of the US and planned parenthood is decidedly rocky at this pointIn the great white north, the pregnancy tests from dollarama are 2 or 3 dollars. I have been told by a nurse friend that they are the same ones they use at the hospitals! 

I'm sorry about the state of abortion in your state... If people don't believe in it, that's fine; but nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your own body. The USA makes me sad.If you are pregnant, they may put you on buprenorphine, which, won't be the worst thing. You can always stay on a small dose, like,  under 4 mg a day, and taper off after the baby is born. Should you choose to follow through with the pregnancy, staying clean is going to be something you would have to do.  As a mother of three, I can honestly say that my kids force me to be a better person than I could ever possibly have been without them.  

Babies are not all rainbows and butterflies,  but they are quite literally the only thing on this planet that you will love deeply and truly.  I had no idea what love was (thought I did) until my first child was born. After he was born, my entire world shifted on its axis and suddenly,  I was no longer afraid of anything for myself. I knew I could do anything at all to ensure his safety and well being. 


I hope all goes well tomorrow with all your tests!! Even if you end up testing + for the HIV/Hep C, its devastating,  but with current medical treatments, you would stand a much higher chance of survival and even remission than you would have a decade ago.   I had HIC/Hep C tests done every 6 months for almost a decade after I found out that one of the guys I had slept with was supposedly HIV/Hep C positive.   Scary ass shit for sure.. and it sucked ass having to tell every future partner that it was a possibility.  Thankfully,  I have never had a positive result. I am sure you will be ok too!I’m glad you’ve got an appointment. I know how nerve-wracking it can be though. If you need someone to chat with who has been through it, give me a shout. I’ll reply if I’m awake <3No problem at all! Hope it is nothing more than a scare for you, good luck!Sounds good. It sounds like you are having a lot of pregnancy symptoms, so I'm glad you're testing immediately. 

If you are pregnant and need support, feel free to reach out, no matter what choice you decide to make. 

I got pregnant with my first very early in sobriety and ended up relapsing after baby #3. I'm currently clean, but it's been a struggle.I am so glad I could help! Yeah, Project Prevention is great. I also knew I should never have kids. 

Here's a link to Project Prevention. 

http://www.projectprevention.org/contact-us/Hopefully not the case but Nashville Tennessee if it is the case and also ask about the pill one instead of the procedure it's less invasive and cheaper.I can definitely see your point. I truly hope everything works out for youThanks love, just woke up and about to run to get those dollar pregnancy test strips at dollar tree. Cross your fingers for me its negative..ha,ha i LOVE your reply.First off you said you sounded like a slut not me.  All I did was validate your own words. Second you came here asking for advice I didn’t ask you. I never mentioned having a baby and keeping it but unless you lack some basic sense getting pregnant is a likely outcome of unprotected intercourse.  And you say that you had no intention of getting pregnant nor keeping the baby if you did well then there is no good excuse to not take basic precaution and use protection to minimize the risk of getting pregnant(contraception and condoms cost nothing if you go to at risk centers similar places/shelters)

You talk of all these negative consequences and bad decisions you’ve made and likely have continually made but show only regret and self loathing and pity instead of things you could do to make your situation in life better, you for instance want to have an abortion instead of avoiding the decisions you made to get to that point and then when someone like me points out the obvious I get crucified as a dick. Which is fine I really don’t care, you’ve probably had people coddle you and have learned that by playing the victim and pity card you insulate yourself from criticism until someone stops enabling you. Consider yourself lucky you have a car to put change in the gas tank, I learned that no matter how bad I think I have it there is always someone who has it worse.  I lived out of my car until it was stolen and sold for scrap then I was homeless.  So while you can find sympathy from some here most of the time you will find the opposite too because most everyone here has been there and done that. So I’ll leave the sympathy angle for those that are good at it. 

But a lot of people that don’t know addiction inside and out won’t deal with the type of manipulations and stuff addicts do because they’ve done it themselves. 

You didn’t mention anything about keeping it you just casually act as if it’s more of a burden on you to be responsible and use protection than it would be to have an abortion. 

I’m not lecturing you about keeping it, obviously it’s a lecture about being a responsible adult and judging by your admitted decision making you are incapable or unwilling to do so. 

You wouldn’t even be in your situation had you been the tiniest bit responsible   I’m not the most responsible person but I’m more so than I used to be once I realized that the inconvenience of having the tiniest bit of responsibility is a lot less harmful than dealing with the outcome of bad decision. 

I’m not chastising your it’s called advice, obciously you want to play the victim because that makes you immune to needing to take responsibility for your own decisions in life. 

We all have our issues,  but not everyone here is going to coddle you because at some point a lot of us have had to be responsible and fix ourselves because denial was just perpetuating the bad outcomes. 
Meh at do you want a pat on the back and congrats for being completely selfish?


I’m not lecturing everyone that comes thru here and you don’t me just as I don’t know you I didn’t make any assumptions I just went off the info you voluntarily divulged. 

 I was on all kinds of benzos and amphetamines legitimately prescribed and always told myself my addiction to pills are getting worse and I can only make it two weeks instead of four on the same amount of pills because my dick doctor won’t prescribe me my psych meds anymore.  

No combination of pills is going to magically make everything better( maybe just easier temporarily ) it is a bandaid for a bullet wound you say things like you won’t get any better until you find x combination of medicine and that it sucks waking up being a fuckup.  Yeah we all know that here, and some of us have gotten past the point of feeling sorry for ourselves and realized that the mentality  of victim hood gets people nowhere except further down the same tubes of the same cycle. 

I don’t know if you’ve had tough love or not so it’s worth a try is it not?  Not everyone is gonna to tell you what you want to hear but some will tell you what you need to hear. 

The problem isn’t with access to abortion clinics or being in a conservative state or being undermedicated. It is the mentality that you continue to try to fix the symptom instead of the disease.  Lack of abortion resources or money to have one isn’t the problem it’s that you think that having an abortion is your first and best option whereas had you made better decisions you wouldn’t even be in that situation to begin with. 

And you are in denial because making good decisions is a lot harder than just dealing with the symptom of making bad decisions. 

Saying you know you make bad decisions and feeling like a fuckup isn’t going to get you anywhere admitting it is the easy part now you have to do something about it to change it

Life is hard. Especially with addiction , I wouldn’t be here had I not already been thru everything I’ve just mentioned. 

Look at it this way if this sub is your opiate family then someone needs to be the asshole uncle/brother/sister/cousin. Otherwise it just would be unrealisticI'm here for you, I don't have any answers but sometimes it is just good to know another woman out there is rooting for you. Love and light.Just ignore the people that send you negative messages. Assholes are everywhere and in these times is seems like it's a trend to be as mean as possible. Probabably just a  bunch of hypocrites judging your habit while they blacks out from too much drinking every weekend, fuck like dogs with god knows who, but they think is right to judge you because your choice is heroin. At least you know who you sleep with and you show in this post that you are a responsible person.Awesome, I'll use that to do some more research myself. I got an anecdotal comment from another user though that said she got pregnant 3 times while using opiates. She didnt specify her ROA though and I think that does make a difference when it comes to how it effects you physically. Either way, I think I'm going to just focus on finding a free clinic that'll do a free pregnancy test for me. And thanks, I'll figure something out. I'm nothing if not resourceful lol.>Stealthing is when the guy takes the condom off without you knowing. 

What the fuck. What a peice of shit. I'm sorry someone did that to you. 

Thanks for the well wishes. Om going to the dollar store tomorrow first thing and getting two strips. Scrapped together the change tonight. And drove my plug around tonight in trade for some fire dope so luckily, I'll catch a nod and not freak out all night worrying. Take care girlie <3 if this shit goes the wrong way tomorrow, I actually might pm you with some questions. Thanks so much for offering.Yeah, I can definitely update you tomorrow. That's sweet that you care to know what happens to me :)

>the state of the US and planned parenthood is decidedly rocky at this point

It sucks. I'm in a state where you can't get an abortion after 6 weeks too...who the hell knows they're pregnant before 6 weeks?! Its ludicrous. I hope they over turn it in the supreme court but until then, if it is the worst outcome, I'll have to travel to another state. It discriminates against women that don't have those means. It's disgusting. Anyway, sorry for the rant. I get super heated about that topic.I feel like gold means a lot more on this sub hahah damn whos throwin $5 around like thatapparently methadone is recommended for pregnancy while suboxone is considered more dangerous for the babyAmazing, thanks a ton! Cool, Nashville is fairly close to me and I think my guy and I can find a way to get up there if we have to. Thats funny you mentioned it because I was just reading about the pill option. It definitely sounds like the better option for me if it comes to that. Mentally, I don't think I could get through the procedure. Apparently, you're awake for it and the machine makes a bunch of noise. No way I'd get through that. Thanks for the tip, hopefully I wont need it thoughI just want you to know what a **huge** waste of time writing all that out was. I didnt read it because you've already shown you have nothing of value to add to this conversation. Go lecture someone else you dont know, about shit you clearly have no real experience with. I'm full up on "tough love" pricks that think they know me better than I know me.“I don’t know if you’ve had tough love” lol have you met an addict, alcoholic, or even a fat person? People are frothing at the mouth to give us tough love. I swear to god they masturbate about thinking about the chance to. Take this shit to a recovery sub.Well just because she isn't as irresponsible as she could be doesn't mean she's responsible. Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticising OP but I don't think any addict is really a filly responsible person. Even people who are super DL like doctors or other more respected professions. You always sacrifice something for this and it always ends up causing at least some problems. I'm no better at all as I've had lots of unprotected sex and if my partners were lying about their birth control id be in a similar position and that sucks. Now I'm in a monogamous relationship with someone on birth control but if I wasn't who knows if I'd have learned from my mistakes. 

The real responsible person uses protection and doesn't use hard drugs.Also.. dont search on Google.  Your answers will be limited.  Search on duckduckgo.   Google has cut out most drug related info unless it's about rehab.  Or they will redirect you to a recovery or rehab page.Hey lady- thanks so much, yeah men kinda suck sometimes. It’s been a while since that happened tho and am over it for the most part. Never had to see that guy again.

Let me know how the test goes! So glad it worked out that you are getting the strips AND fire Dope! (Also, in case you didn’t know, best to take preggo tests first pee of the morning if you can swing it). Best of luck!What's even more crazy, is men are making these decisions for women's.Oh I hear ya! Right there with ya sista! And then all the stuff that’s going on in Ohio about “trying” to reimplant ectopic pregnancies and the new charges they could bring against doctors and shit. They’re all losing their minds. 

I got pregnant while using and used the whole pregnancy so I just want to support a fellow lady in their time of need!I am not sure but I am appreciative of it! I cannot imagine that many users would have money to throw around, so yeah. It means a lot more here!Realistically probably someone in recovery who enjoyed the comment. I know I did.Buprenorphine without the naloxone is often given in lieu of methadone in the area that I live in. As long as it does not have nalaxone in it, it should be fine.Hmm I did it for me not you obviously you aren’t mature or stable enough to listen to someone else judge you the same way you judge them. You won’t get anywhere til you detach yourself from your own ego and see advice for what it is other than a personal attack. Sure is easy to point out your own flaws but when someone else just repeats the exact same problems you point out oh noes it’s pity party time.

People that succeed listen to the hard stuff as well as the good so no wonder you are where you are.I love you  :) lolGeez idk don’t think I met any of those types but I do know I’ve met a smartass that is a lot more pathetic than funny.Shit, now that you say that I've noticed the information that I get from drug related searches has changed lately.  Wtf google.Yup that's the worst partWhat?! I hadnt heard about that in Ohio! Are they out their goddamn minds? When did believing in God start to mean playing God by taking a pregnancy that isn't viable and *forcing* it to be viable? Aren't they supposed to believe in God's design and all that shit? Wow. That blows my mind. 

And thanks for the support, love! nothing about any of this is black and white, good or bad. Its complicated and messy. I'm pretty sure I wouldnt choose to keep it if I'm pregnant because, for me, I just can't bring a child into my life. I'm a shitshow. But it would be devastating for me to make that choice. I hope I dont have to. I understand why women in our situation make the choice they do, either way, because your heart pulls you in both directions. It's hard. I hope you and the baby are doing well now <3Ok, homie. I didnt bother to finish that comment either once I read "I did it for me not you". Lol, that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. You spent all that time typing out 7 paragraphs of patronizing recovery cliches "for yourself"?

Whatever you need to tell yourself to justify being a judgemental, know-it-all prick that spends hours yelling into a vacuum. Lol. People like you are the reason some addicts avoid AA.Oh...cool.....good for you, I guess?The abortion debate is just so baffling to me. I can't wrap my head around the fact that so many people have this archaic, whacky point of view about it. 
For one, any legislation that tries to govern what you can do with your body (as long as you're not hurting others) is trash. Just like drug laws. 
Humans dont even start counting their life's age until after they're born, yet pro-lifers call it "murder" even though that "person" isnt even a person yet. 
And then they ridicule and shame women who've had abortions, as if they dont already feel terrible. Its like going up to somebody who just had to euthanize their pet and calling them a murderer and showing them pictures of dead animals. Who the fuck does that? Not only is it an unfortunate situation to be in, but the pro-lifers aren't the ones who have to deal with it.Yeah you can’t actually reimplant an ectopic pregnancy. Like it just can’t happen. But yeah they’re all nuts there. That bill just happened this week (they presented it) so it’s been very ��‍♀️. 

And yes we’re good now. She’s been back in my custody for just over a year now and I’m done with all the CPS stuff as of this September so yay! But it was also the kick in the pants I needed to stop all the crazy.>Yeah you can’t actually reimplant an ectopic pregnancy. Like it just can’t happen. But yeah they’re all nuts there. That bill just happened this week (they presented it) so it’s been very ��‍♀️. 

I was wondering how the hell that would even be possible. I'm relieved to hear its not something they're actually trying to do. 

That's awesome to hear that you're doing well! I'm glad you were able to conquer this shit and your daughter is with you again where she belongs :)

I'm planning on checking into rehab in the next few weeks myself pending a few scholarships I've applied for the attend a program. I have no insurance or money lol so I'm hoping someone will believe enough that I can get sober to let me into a program at little to no cost. We'll see.

Keep up the great work you're doing! @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Anyone on vivitrol ever tried this?, Content: So I woulda asked this on the vivitrol sub but it’s got like 84 members and I’m sure a lot of us here have been on or thought about vivitrol.  So here’s my question.  Has anyone tried out the old it takes 2 days to fully kick in so you tried to use immediately after getting your first injection? I don’t see how this would work bc my first time taking it I got PWD like 45 mins after taking the shot so to me that means it’s starting to kick shit off receptors and bind pretty quickly.  Also couldn’t that throw you into WD if you used an hour after the shot too?  Just curious if anyone has ever tried this, ups: 2, downs: 0Why would you want to do something like that? If you're still interested in getting high, why bother with the injection at all?Subs break thru vivitrol. Will help get u unsick but then vivitrol kicks back in when the bupe fadesGood point, I’m just trippin rn bc I’m still sick and my brain is trying it’s best to get what it wants but I have to get it right this time.

Like, just someone talking is too loud. I end up turning the TV right down to a point where I normally wouldn't be able to hear it. 

What's with that? Is it just me?, ups: 1, downs: 0I'm already quite sound sensitive, so difficult for me to say personally, but I can't recall anyone ever remarking on such an occurrenceReddit won’t let me make my own post so I guess I’ll
Use this one lol. I took a 10th of a sub Sunday morning, then a 10th of a sub yesterday morning (maybe less than a 10th but definitely not more) just to help with withdrawals bc I had no oxy left. If I were to take my normal dose of oxy today (it’s been over 24 hours since last sub dose) would I be able to get anything out of it? Prior to taking those 2 small sub doses I was only taking oxy. 

Edit: The 10th of a sub is off of a 8mg stripNot really cool to hijack someone's thread, man/ladyNot really cool that I can’t post my own :/ @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Anyone else have a problem with drugs showing up in screenings for a really long time?, Content: I’m on methadone and for the most part I’m clean but I still have the odd slip (max twice a month use) but I find I end up being dirty for over a week at least afterwords. I used to be able to pass a pee test after only a few days being clean but now even one day of use seems to make me dirty for at least 10 days.  One time I hadn’t used it two weeks and I was still dirty which is super frustrating!! Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else? For reference I use fentanyl either smoking or snorting., ups: 1, downs: 0This can happen if you have a liver enzyme issue.  If for some reason you have a deficiency in the enzymes that break down what ever drug it is you are using.. or if for example,  you are using fentanyl analogues that have no known half life, you could end up peeing dirty for a long time. I would suggest having a liver panel done just to make sure everything is OK in that area. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Hey guys, Content: I figured I’d pop back in after a couple months of being unsubbed from r/opiates. Guys, if you’re struggling endlessly feeling like nothing works PLEASE ignore all the “addiction” shit and see a psychiatrist. Be honest about your symptoms and don’t be afraid to tell a few to fuck off till u find the right person for you. I can’t fucking believe how many shitty people in the medical field I’ve had to deal with to get a proper diagnosis. I’ve been on subs, cymbalta, and Seroquel for a few months and holy shit, what a world of difference. I tried the subs by themselves for almost a year and I was still completely out of my mind, just couldn’t stop using as often as I was able to. A real fucked up on/off/on/off cycle... within a week of taking the Seroquel and cymbalta I felt like an entirely new person. This is what it feels like to be a normal person I’ve felt every morning since. And this is only a message to the most desperate, if you are in the beginning stages please learn everything you can about addiction, but if ur still suffering even after all the knowledge in the world, move on to the next logical step. I feel better now than I ever have in my life. I want each and every one of you to experience the same. If you have any questions about how to get started or just need someone to talk to, pls dm me. Love u guys. Pls be safe., ups: 16, downs: 0Wow man that's awesome. You're so lucky that you were able to find the right meds first try. It seems like my psych is just playing a guessing game sometimes. But therapy and weed have done wonders for me. After a year clean I'm finally starting to get a bit of life back in me. You gotta figure out why you were self medicating in the first place. Gotta deal with the trauma and the depression/anxiety. Proud of you man. Keep it up! I got a year myself. Only one slip up and I can honestly say counting clean days and going to cult meetings haven't had anything to do with it. When I slipped up I didn't have to go pick up some dumb chip. I just moved on and it never happened again. Probably cause I didn't make some huge deal about it.How did you get off opiates then with both of them meds being for depression and so on.man... I really wish it was the first time with the meds... I’ve been going to docs my whole life and all they were willing to prescribe was Zoloft/Prozac bullshit. They were all absolutely unwilling to recognize that I have something more than general depression and anxiety. Fuckers. Like, I was first put on meds when I was 14, I’m 32 now... and YES, I’m learning that trauma seems to be at the root of all my problems, that shit is DEEPLY embedded, just takes time and patience to root out. And man, I’m SO happy for you, while I won’t knock somebody’s success in the program it absolutely WAS NOT for me and I know there are a ton of people like me. it kills me how they make it seem like 12 steps is the ONLY way, I really think that fucks up a ton of new-to-recovery people that are at their most vulnerable. And day counting... if somebody wants to count days, great, knock ur self out, but I def feel there’s this weird belief attached to it that if you slip up then you’ve not just lost your days, but your experience. They have you restart everything and go back to the “sit down, shut up, and listen” phase of things and I just think that’s completely fucked. Also not to mention just sitting in rooms with junkies talking about junk pretty much always will make me want to use. Glad you and I have found an alternative path. Love you dude, keep on fighting the good fight. Oh, and SMOKE WEEED EVERY DAYYY lolAight so I started taking subs December of last year, but didn’t start taking Seroquel (for bipolar type 1) and cymbalta (for complex PTSD) until September. Between December and September I could not leave dope alone. Within a week of starting meds in sept my mind just started working right. No more racing thoughts, no more 1,000 trains of thought, no more existential dread, more more depression, no more anxiety. Just gone. Haven’t even considered dope. It feels like another life @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Does kratom cancels oxy?, Content: Took kratom at around 6AM, its 1:15AM now.. Been around 20ish hours.. so I should be ok to dose Oxycodone or (Percocet) 30mgs on low tolerance am I right? 

One told me I wouldn't feel the oxy as kratom will probably cancel it out. Is that true? I just took it, guess ill find out either ways ._. Hope its not a waste, ups: 6, downs: 0Yes it does. Kratom sticks to the same receptors you need to “accept” the oxycodone.

The half life of Kratom is 22 hours.

Wait at least 2-3 days before taking opiates after Kratom.

Learned that the hard way one time when I scored 30mg of hydro (enough to make me nod) and i barely caught a buzz.Could very well do it yes. From what I've read online, Kratom binds more "loosely" to opioid receptors than things like oxy or hydro etc. Thus, its basically stealing away receptors that could be more well activated by other opioids.

This hasn't been empirically researched to be the case but it seems pretty likely. Take it with a grain of salt.Can you buy kratom legally in the states?Kratom cuases hair loss when your using i thinkOMG that could be the reason! I also didn't feel Hydros at all back when I had a stash of like 20 pills. Thought "They weren't for me" but I guess not, I was literally abusing kratom daily.. FUUCKK MY LIFE. Well what if I passed 20hrs ? Will I get any buzz at all? Fuck I just took 3 10mgs percs smh hope I didnt waste em.

Thanks for the headsup, this is so fucking baddd ):Same, I wasted four 80's trying to nod out.. Barely felt it over course of ten hours. Popped one every couple hours chasing it.. Didn't realize how strong the kratom actually isOhh yeah its true trust me, Its been around 2.5hrs and I only felt slightly itchy, had a single nodd which could very well be a placebo. and that was it. Cant tell you how stupid I feel rn lmaoYepp, in most gas stations, and headshops.heard of it jesus, hope thats not trueeAfter 4 months continuous use my hairline got super thin. Now that I stopped it hasn’t thinned anymore, but it still looks shit compared to before I used every day

Not even steroids thinned my hair as much as kratom didIt’s so much that Kratom is strong, I think of it more like hippy subs.

I usually have to give it a solid 5 days off before I feel opiates like I use too.Kratom is great, for when you don't have anything else though.. Just keep it in stockright?! Me too man , this shit is shocking.. Im totally not feeling the Percs )':Oh I do believe that, was talking about why it might be happening is all. Wish I had access to lab equipment to figure this stuff out lolI felt my hair go thinner but i think it did but fuck that. Kratom taste like shit and i get nauseous if i consume kratom. Taste like shit and tolerance builds fast . Not worth my hair. I like the opioid like  euphoria thoughNot sure if its true but of all the meth and alcohol i put in me i used kratom actually shows physical signs of damage and its the hair in a short amount of time. Im not sure if its truelol �lol take the capsules then.I would agree, with the damage part. 

I think I read somewhere that it’s an immunostimulant and it restricts blood flow to the follicles, killing them. 

But I dunno maybe I’m not remembering correctlyI get nuaseous before my body has tome to process the kratom. Im going to actually listen to my body and not consume kratomTry, Dph 75mg or 100mgs along with your kratom dose!

I think I found the reason why methadone has a very variable metabolism. [the study states that:](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/9/3/315/1925903)the study states: 

“The Cmax and AUC of the omeprazole and bicarbonate groups increased at least threefold as compared with placebo, and there were no significant differences between these two groups. Changes in Cmax and AUC in the acidic group did not differ significantly from placebo.”

So basically a more alkaline gastric tract increases methadone’s absorption and half-life, whice an acidic doesn’t differ from placebo numbers., ups: 1, downs: 0Yeah I always had wide varying effects with both pills and liquid, never really cared for it for maintenance or recreationi am guessing its because nahtzeeees made it and all white people are evil...the jews in the media and in hollywood told me so. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Possible physical dependence on oxycodone post surgery, Content: Throwaway because reasons.

Stats: 40 something woman, post back surgery (to repair a disc herniation in my low back) on 10/30. Prior to this I had terrible sciatica. I had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get some pain medication, which was finally 5mg oxycodone to take as needed every 4 hours.

I was taking about 2 to max 4 pills per day for a month before surgery. After surgery, for the first two weeks my allowed dose was higher : up to 10 mg every 4 hours as needed. For one week post op that's pretty much what I took, but also some 7.5 mg pills I got from a family member's leftovers from their surgery (yes, I know that was probably bad, but back pain and sciatica really sucks).

Since surgery my surgeon has refilled my script twice: 20 pills at a time, 1 5 mg pill every 4 hours as needed. I've been taking on average 2 to 3 pills a day. For the record I'm still having buttock and sciatic pain, which my surgeon says is typical because of the type of herniation I had; it will take time to settle down. I am doing physical therapy regularly.

I can't take ibuprofen and drugs like that because i had weight loss surgery, and those drugs can cause stomach ulcers.

I ran out of oxycodone on Sunday night. Emailed my provider yesterday asking for a refill, and I haven't heard from her yet (I'm sure they were swamped at the office from the holiday weekend). 

Last night I started feeling very weird: so restless that i was thrashing about, I had to keep walking around my apartment to burn off some energy. Same feeling when I went to bed. I was up at 4:30AM because I couldn't sleep anymore. I actually did a walking workout video in my living room to try and burn off some energy (it helped a little). My nose is mildly stuffy.

I'm wondering if this counts as physical withdrawal, or addiction? I've never taken any other type of illicit drug (other than a couple of times with pot prior to surgery when I was desperate to try anything for pain control since it's legal in my state; it didn't really do anything other than put me to sleep). I do have a mental illness and take four medications daily to manage it.

Any advice you could give would be much appreciated., ups: 2, downs: 0Anyone after a month or so of a Opiate analgesic, will become physically dependant, this doesn't make you a addict by any means.
  
  You are getting mild withdrawl symptoms, stuffy nose, restless,insomnia....etc

The best this I could suggest is getting your doctor to be clear with you on how long you'll need to take these medications ,so that you can be tapered toward the end of your prescribed hydrocodone/oxycodone.
      
   By reducing a little at a time, these withdrawal symptoms are not as SUDDEN and intense.

On another topic, I know these medications can relieve pain significantly , but if you have to take the months/years on end, your withdrawal will be tough and extremely more complicated.

   If your prescribed neurotin or Lyrica , these medications lessen the intensely of withdrawl syndrome.
    Best of luck hope to help.You are fine. It'll go away in a day or so.

Just be honest with your Doctors. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Couldn’t fall asleep the whole night from opis, Content: So, I took some German pills called Tilidin, it’s an opioid, around like 1 in the night. Was chilling till 3 and then tried to sleep, I just couldn’t. I was restless till 7 in the morning and then managed to get some sleep, I also had a lot of Thoughts I just couldn’t control. Not a real Opi user, so I wanted to ask if it’s normal?, ups: 2, downs: 0When I used to get high on oxy or any kinda pain pill really , I would never sleep well, almost in and out of 
Consciousness , which  never was a problem cause you’re high. I could get shit sleep and feel just fine about it since I was high.When I was using, I would have to take my last pill six hours before bedtime or I wouldn't sleep at all.   Certainly normal for me.Pretty typical.  When I had a habit, this usually didn't happen unless I had super strong gear, but when I chipped and had very low tolerance, this would happen every time.Yeah I can’t sleep on Them either.Yes this is normal, tilidin is very stimulating. Atleast for me @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Non withdrawal related sleep issues, Content: Does anyone else experience this? Regardless of how good the dope is I can never manage to sleep past 4 or 5am. I've tried dosing right before bed, staying up later, basically everything I can think of supplement/medicine wise and nothing's helped. If I dose and try to go back to sleep it will sometimes works but when I wake up 2 hours later I feel like shit. 

 
Even when I was on methadone for a couple years I was up with the chickens everyday. I know I'm not alone because I'd always see the same 10 or 15 people every morning at the clinic waiting on the door to open and fighting for that first spot. My gf on the otherhand, who is sleeping like a baby right now, has never had this issue and is still on methadone. This is what confuses me the most because even with a stable opiate with along half-life I have the same problem. 


I try not to complain about it because I know well enough the hell of going days without sleep while kicking, but goddamnit I miss waking up and seeing daylight. I'm running out of podcasts and shit to watch to occupy this 2-3 hours everyday. 


Again I do cherish my 5hrs of sleep I average but the sleep debt is real and once a week or so it hits me really hard and tbh the only things that helps is some sort of amphetamine to manage getting through work. Obviously it doesn't help my issue but I gotta keep a roof over my head. I work a pretty physically demanding job so it's not like it's a lack of activity causing my problem., ups: 2, downs: 0I literally have the same problem. When sober I can sleep until 9-10 if I wanted but when I have dope, even knowing I have some for the morning, I wake up at 4-5 am constantly and then try and go back to sleep but it's like well I'm up might as well do a shotMaybe you metabolize the drug faster than otherExactly and even if I do go back to sleep I have to be up around 730 most days and that 1.5-2 extra hours doesn't really help and tbh cause me to use more. I hate falling asleep for short periods tbh its like my body metabolizes every speck of opiates in my system and I have to dose again in order to get back to feeling right. 

It's kinda funny after dealing with this for so long and multiple bouts of "sobriety" I've kept my usage so low this time around . Now years ago when I was constantly chasing a rush and shooting it was a different story but for the past 2years or so I'm happy to say I've stayed completely needle free. I guess after learning the hard way countless times I've just accepted that if I plan on keeping this up, which I do tbh, I've gotta just accept it as a maintenance thing. The rush always fades and I hate the idea of not being able to receive life saving medical treatment due to wrecking my veins.Well I wanna say congratulations man on putting the needle down, having trouble doing that myself but I hope to one day. And yeah I wind up doing a shot at like 4am and then fall asleep it feels like such a wasteThanks dude. Probably the best decision of my life after seeing a lot of my friends with that monstrous scar on their sternum. It's fucked and of course most of the are still wrecking the pig valve they had put in . Tbh tho if it wasn't for the angel that is my lady I probably wouldn't have been able to do it and most likely wouldn't be alive now. She has tolerated so much of my bullshit but the needles are the limit and that's def something I can live with. Of course there have been times I've tried but I swear if she's anywhere within a mile of me she will bust in and beat my ass. Rightfully so though if you ask me.That's good though that your girls around like that. My girl used to do the same thing for me but she passed away in June so now I have no one to stop me. My veins are fucked so I know this is gonna come to an end soon I just hope it's more of me choosing to stop rather than me choosing to off myself ya knowFuck dude I'm so sorry. I seriously don't know what I'd do in your shoes but all I can think to say is to do it for her if not for yourself. If you ever need anyone to talk to my inbox is open.Thanks man I'm not trying to be the pity party or any of that bullshit. I lost my dad a few months before her so I know I should be doing it for them but having this happen so close together I mentally can't handle itI understand. I lost my dad last year and its really only registered after the fact. We had a complicated relationship for a while but did manage to get it to a better place. Though there was definitely a lot left unsaid due to how sudden it happened. Like last week I reactivated my Facebook to find someones phone number and I saw a 9yr old friend request from him and it hit me like a brick to the face.Oh man I'm so sorry dude. I know how that stuff can be. Still haven't deleted a birthday text I had sent to my dad or the convos with my girl. Eventually just not now. I'm glad you and your dad were able to get to a better place before he passed. I also appreciate you talking to meAnytime my guy. I feel awful for drudging those feelings outta you so it's the least I can do @@@@@@@@@@ Title: For those of you prescribed Fentanyl for chronic pain, Content: A question: Currently on 50 MCG of Fentanyl patch (genetic brand) for Peripheral Neuropathy and I’ve noticed the first day I put the patch on it wipes me out physically and makes me yawn nonstop and despite that it’ll make my my mind race/then go back to mental exhaustion 

Anyone else have this problem or is it possibly due to other symptoms? I’ve been on 50 Micrograms for 5 years and it recently just started happening, I haven’t started any new meds nor have I changed my diet, I usually get 8 hours of sleep per night, ups: 0, downs: 0This happens when you change the patch? My educated guess would be that you are yawning non stop and tired due to mild withdrawal.  There is a lag time between when you take the old patch off and put a new one on of about 24 hours. This basically means that there is a fairly significant drop in blood plasma levels as the new patch is being applied because as the old ones life is wearing out, levels go down, and it takes time for them to reach the same level they were after the new patch is put on.Like TATP1982 explained this might be due to withdrawal. Especially since Fentanyl is so potent, withdrawal may happen rather quickly.

However you told 'the first day I put the patch on', what do you mean by that or was it just a typing error and you wanted to say the first day you tear the patches off? If that's the case then yes, these are obvious withdrawal symptoms.

So your doctor started you on Fentanyl patches as your first pain medication? Or did you take any other opioid medication before that? I don't know what's common practice in your country and for your condition, however in my country Fentanyl patches are the last opioid medication they're gonna prescribe you, since it's one of the most potent. Usually without tolerance the weakest opioids work like a charm even in the lowest dosages. Taking Fentanyl for 5 years straight without being tolerant to opioids beforehand raises your tolerance like crazy so all the weaker opioids won't work as fine / you'd need a high dosage of them by now. Usually you start with weak ones and if you require long term opioid medication they slowly start prescribing you the more powerful ones in order to slowly increase your tolerance.

Edit: Moreover Fentanyl has a rather short half life, so any time without a patch your blood levels drop quickly, which may explain withdrawals kicking in even more.Exactly what I was thinking.  I would def want something else to hold me that day I changed the patchI tried literally everything from anti psychotics, stuff like Neurontin/Lyrica and some of the other notable stuff narcs but nothing helped like fentanyl

It’s mostly noticeable during the lag time of taking off old patch and putting a new one on

If it’s between going through the annoying affects or switching to a less effective opioid I can tolerate thisI was on breakthrough meds (norco) for things like that before the ridiculous opioid OD epidemic and now they want me off everything except an anti-seizure medI hate this fucking opioid epidemic bullshit. The folks being hurt are the ones who genuinely need it!!!  While there are a couple of methods to get the medication to absorb quicker, they are very dangerous and I would not feel right giving that  advice... but...if this issue is stopping you from being able to function normally for a day or so, you may want to do some research on ways other folks have gotten past it. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Fentanyl tolerance randomly becoming unstoppable., Content: So I’ve had a reliable, ACTUAL fentanyl HCl hookup for a minute now, and I’ve been able to keep my dosing pretty standard the whole time. But recently that shit has changed.



It’s like after a year, my body randomly decided that ~5mg/day IV isn’t shit anymore. It’s the same batch, so I know the purity is solid. I have an excellent scale and self control. I’ve been happily maintaining this forever.



I *have* been fucking around with some isotonitazene lately, but obviously accounting for dosage changes to mitigate tolerance rise. Also, that’s never often at all. 


Could it really be that the iso is just that shit of a drug that it rapes your tolerance like nothing else? Even when not increasing one’s dose, deliberately slipping into slight WDs to prevent tolerance rise?


Anyway, all opinions welcome. Especially those with experience with these more potent chems., ups: 1, downs: 0Well if theres one thing u dont want to do: its increasing your dosage. Dont risk overdose bro try to quit or at least quit for a little bit to lower tolerance.I haven’t, trust me. And ODing is very difficult for me apparently, not that I’d ever risk it. Thank you though.I thought the same thing.  Went 8+ years of mostly active addiction without a single OD.  Well a few weeks ago I woke up in an ambulance bc I ODed on fent.  If some lady didn’t find me and call for help I woulda prolly  OD’ed on the sidewalk.  Shit was scary. What’s even scarier is that immediately after leaving the ER I went and got the same shit that just almost killed me and just “went easier” with it.  This addiction shit is insane @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Snorting buprenorphine (Subutex), Content: Any advice for doing this? I've managed to screw myself over and empty my prescription morphine supply and will not get any more for at least five days. Luckily I still have a dozen or so 8mg Subutex tabs left.

Normally I just take 1/2mg a day for three days to cover the WD from the morphine and the bupe half-life would carry me the subsequent two days and I'd be ready for a full agonist again.

This time I'd like to try and get a buzz from the bupe. I have managed it several times before sublingually, but I've heard that intranasally has a much higher bioavailability - and this is Subutex so it's straight buprenorphine with no naloxone. 

I would assume it is a simple matter of just crushing part of a tab up finely (as I would do to defeat SR morphine or DHC pills) and then use a pen tube and snort up one nostril?, ups: 1, downs: 0Yup, that's about it. You're aiming at getting the powder in the gap just behind your nose, coating the nasal cavity with it, so a short sharp breath inwards through the tube (which I'd advise should be slightly larger in diameter than a pen, but it shouldn't make a huge difference). I've found the drier your nose is the better the absorption tends to be, though likely only because it absorbs more quickly if not more completely.

Watch out for precipitated withdrawals.Just pinch one nostril and suck it up with the other through a empty pen or straw...Sub has such a nasty, fuzzy headed high, imo. More power to ya, though, be safe @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Literally "fell asleep and forgot to die", Content: Hey Reddit, I think i almost died last night.

Im not physically dependent, but fuck do i love the dope/fentanyl mix that's sold as H in the Northeast US. After a 4 day break from dope i picked up a bun (10 bags if your area calls it something else) last night, friend warned me it was strong as fuck. There's fentanyl in all the dope in my area, so I've learned to be extremely careful as the first time I tried heroin was my second time trying an opioid, the first time Percocet years before this.

I did a taste, didn't fall out so I did a bump, didn't fall out so I did a small line. This far I hadn't died, and had gauged how strong it was (the strongest dope ever, but not too much for me). I was buzzing strong all night, gf didn't know though. Finally at 3am I couldn't sleep, got up to go and cut loose now that gf wasn't awake to catch me. Went down and locked the bathroom door.

With the door locked, I finished the first bag i opened earlier. Then, around 3:30, I snorted 2 lines out of the second bag. This is the last thing i remember. Next thing i know, I wake up at 5am still sitting on my legs Indian style, forehead flat down on the floor with still full stamp bags littered around me and the second bag worth of dope still laid out on the back of the toilet. Music's still going, and I'm absolutely fucking stupid high. I try to stand up, stumble, decide to sit down and lean against the wall. Next thing i know, same situation i wake at 6am slumped against the toilet. My GF was asleep and the door was locked that whole time, 3 hours.

Im still all fucked up, took an hour to tyoe this cause I'm still nodding. I feel that I've never been so close to death before, not is it possible to get any closer without being actually dead.

AMA, and also explain to me how close to fucked I was please or if I was just passed out but mostly safe., ups: 1, downs: 0Least you learned your lesson. I’ve done that before where I go from fucked up feeling good to waking up randomly hours later, pissed off that I wasted my high lmao. Usually that happens when I mix my opiates with Xanax or something, which I always regret and don’t even like to do.It's hard to tell without somebody seeing you.

You could have just been nodding off.

I remember my ex I would watch him after he did a hit and make sure he's okay before I did mine and sometimes his lips would turn blue almost, and I'd get the narcan ready and try to wake him up. He would just be on the nod but his system was shutting down.

It's honestly hard to tell just from you being out and waking up.Sounds like a real hard nod. This happens, I've woke up several times like fuck even from on the toilet.One time I was knocking some presses back. And sometimes I’ll do a whole one and then without thinking hit a couple more lines. Well anyways one night I was supposed to get my friend some tree, just like a blunt I had rolled for them. Well it’s like 10pm and they say “hey I’m on my way” so I go out to my car and wait for them. Come to find out at like 11:15pm I woke up in my car to them and my girlfriend knocking on my window and had been for about 20 minutes (I had been breathing they said, and they could tell I was responsive but I just wouldn’t wake up) and as soon as I woke up I immediately knew I fucked up. Was kind of a cool feeling tho not going to lie @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Enormous Tramadol User looking to taper and quit (advice needed), Content: Due to a chronic pain condition, I've been prescribed 8 x 50mg per day for 2-3 years. However I can also buy it online discretely and in the past 3 months ramped up to 12-20 per day and then even 30 on 3-4 exceptional days. Now at 20, I take as 4+8+8 or 8+12 or some combo of that.

But I've realised it's made me slowly gain weight due to completely wiping out my motivation to work out. It's also made me become an impulsive gambler when under the influence and I need viagra/cialis to get hard. I get severe anxiety when i know I'm running low and its becoming a costly habit. 

I want to cut back to 4-6 per day for many reasons: money, my physical health, my sex life, my physique and fitness, work performance and my mental health. 

But I don't know where to start and what to do. I know it maybe as easy as take 4 in the am and 4 before bed to ward off WD's but will that be too much of a severe drop or tolerable. I'm also well aware of seizure risk - I know this community will be less judgemental than most but also have some golden advice. I'm in the UK and have a drug-tested job so weed isnt an option and neither is valium/xanax really. I've never seen a legit kratom source here either. 

I guess this is my cry for help. TIA and Merry Xmas all

Edit: Taking up to 12 at a time now doesn't even give me a buzz or euphoria, just a spaced out feeling with some cold sweats and the need to take a deep breath every now and then. So another reason to quit is that they aren't even working anymore at any dose level., ups: 7, downs: 0Jesus Wept. 

I had a seizure just reading that. 

True story. 

Best of luck man and Merry Christmas �Should jus switch to suboxone at this pointUnfortunately not but I think it would be better for pain . Trams at large doses is verry fatalMan, I can’t even imagine taking Tramadol even remotely recreationally. It gives such a dirty “high”. I know it effects everyone differently, but even taking 300-400mg makes me feel like I might have a seizure at any moment. 
I know you don’t want to admit anything to your doctor, but you could just tell him that you feel your body is becoming dependent on the drug and you’d like them to slowly taper you down a level. But since he doesn’t know you’re buying it online, you will have to have the willpower to stick to the taper schedule you set for yourself. Good luck man, tramadol is some scary stuff.Jesus, switch to O-DSMT. Very similar to Tramadol and you won't get a seizure.I used to use India 100-200mg trams while on probation because it wasn’t tested for. Ended up getting to a 1200mg dose multiple times (I was young and stupid, looking back I’m shocked I never had a seizure). I still experience insomnia and depression from the SSRIs it also affects. But god damn yeah it got to the point 600mg was a starting dose. Thinking back I didn’t even get a nod or a high really, a lot of it feels placebo now. I recommend definitely trying to maintain a healthy dose and maybe find something else to control pain. You can always DM me if you want to talk more, I no longer use tramadol and haven’t in probably a year+. Quitting was hard but having substitutes is helpful. Good luck and cheers, wish you the best.Thanks man. Apologies for the lengthI don't want to admit it to my Dr as this is the only pain medication that's dealt with my condition and I've tried most of the low and mid level stuff that they're willing to try me on. 

Can suboxone be obtained any other way?Due to respiratory depression or seizure risk? From some of the science I've read it doesn't seem to be very toxic and had quite a high LD50? But yeah making this post and admitting I need help already feels like a positive step. I just need to make good on it. Any alternatives to suboxone if I'm going to try and stay committed to reducing the tram and sticking to 6? Is it normal to taper to a semi-permanent maintenance dose when my tolerance is sky-high?Thanks, if my self taper doesn't work that's the route I'll go down. If I can taper back down to 4-6 per day then that's goal achieved I guess. I wouldn't mind coming off completely but the few times I've done it have been horrible - I'm sure 99% of people in this sub know the feelings.

Edit: I've never been high off anything else apart from codeine, and when I done too much of that I got the worst heat rash/itching and almost took the skin of my scalp, plus the high was over within an hour. When I first started taking tram above therapeutic doses I could have the warm fuzzy high for upwards of 4 hours so it's what I always preferred.Is it available to me in the UK? Is it addictive? Would it help to get me off tramadol?Just looked online, its class A here. Can't risk it. Got some Kratom instead so just need to figure out a plan for using it to reduce the tram to a civilian level againNo worries mate. Sorry it was a bit of a low quality/effort comment on my behalf. But holy shit, yeah I’m surprised you’re getting anything much out of it at all. 

Tramadol encounters an enzymatic bottleneck above which you generally don’t get much of an increase in subjective opioid agonist effects, simply due to the enzyme responsible becoming saturated and not being able to cope. 

I’m assuming you’re probably an extensive metaboliser because you seem to enjoy taking higher doses, but man. I’m a bit of a negative nellie when it comes to abuse of tramadol. Early in my career we treated a man who OD’d on tramadol, seized while crossing the road and was run over by a car. Well I say “car” but I think it was more an SUV type of thing. 

He got high as fuck though. That was probably the morphine drip we had him on in the ER while awaiting the ortho guys to come explain to him that his spinal cord was transected and he’d never walk, fuck or shit other than in a bag anymore. But yeah, I obviously dipped out for that convo. 

Seriously good luck, mate.Kratom or weed honestly man that’s how I kicked my opiate habitYeah I don't want that to happen to me and want to rein it in and under control while I'm feeling this moment of mental clarity. Ironically it's after 20 in total today as 4-8-4-4 and I can't sleep and I'm not buzzed or high lol. 

I want a way out, or at the very least back to normal people doses, and need it to be under the radar so as not to alert my friends, family, GF and work. I'm asking a lot.Any idea where kratom is available in the UK? I've heard a lot of good things about it. Weed is off the table due to my job :-(I’m not surprised you can’t sleep. I was gonna ask if you suffered insomnia, but then thought it was a rather personal question to ask someone I’ve only just met. But yeah, theres gonna be a fair bit of serotonin and norepinephrine floating around the old noggin from all that tramadol and that’s generally not conducive to sleep.Funnily enough it used to give me a great nights sleep and lots of confidence and contentedness. I get insomnia when I take a lot, and when I try to take a lot less or run out. When I taper down to around 4 per day, all i want to do is sleep or cry haha.The insomnia often occurs in a dose dependent manner. At lower doses, the opioid agonist tends to dominate hence the associated feelings of mild euphoria, anxiolysis etc. At higher doses, the catecholaminergic effects tend to predominate and cause some people to experience dysphoria, anxiety, insomnia and to, as I’ve heard it described “freak the fuck out”. 

Tramadol kinda sucks to come off because not only do you experience (generally mild) opioid withdrawal, but also SSRI discontinuation syndrome type symptoms which (if not tapered correctly) can lead to relapse or severe agitation.  

Anyway, be good and all the best, friend.Those variations between low and high doses describe it perfectly. Tomorrow I may try 2x50mg when I start to feel slight WD symptoms kick in and then 4-6x closer to bed time and see of that allows me to sleep. Hopefully just having 2 before that point still allows me to function. If I can only do 8 tomorrow, that is so much better (and safer) than the 20 I've been taking.

Thanks for the advice, it's been eye opening, encouraging and very interesting - I'm an accomplished scientist myself and I've learned a lot from you. Can't say any more than that one public open sub. And amazingly helpful. I'm motivated to sort my shit out.No worries mate. Glad to hear my first aid certificate was worth it.First step taken- sourced 100g Kratom which will arrive tomorrow. In capsule form.

What's the best way to use it? Replace a number of the tramadol with the kratom capsules? Replace a full dose of T with Kratom? Drop T cold Turkey and just have 3 portions of 'X'g per day? 

Any help is appreciated.

Instead of waiting for it to break down in the stomach.

Edit: sorry, was wrong about last part so edited it out.It’s a Hollywood thing I believe, chewing them *might* hit you faster, but in my honest opinion and experiences, it really doesn’t do shit. Especially if we’re talking about the instant releases. Depending on the type of extended release it could break the timer mechanism but I still usually just crush and dump them into a cup and drink if I’m taking them orally.Two reasons:

(1) Increased surface area = increased rate of reaction.  This applies to general chemical reaction and the human body's absorption of drugs.

(2) It looks better, more intense, or appears "grimier," potentially used to make people with drug problems appear more worse off.The XR mechanism is not the coating, it is the pill itself.We can agree to disagree, but I do think eating a crushed up IR Oxy hits faster than just swallowing it whole. If you've ever parachuted a shit ton of pills you know this.This, the pill is formulated in a way that it slowly dissolves in the stomach. The coating is mainly for making the swallowing easier/identification and anti counterfeitMy apologies, I just put it there just because of such situations where the XR  is the coating. Such as some types of OXY.Quite the difference in chewing a pill and pulverizing it to parachuteNo it is not.Yes, but even if it isn't entirely powder, when the pill is chewed and swallowed there is a greater surface area contacting the fluids in your stomach, thus breaking it down faster. You can even test this yourself. A whole pill will dissolve much slower than one that has been broken up even slightly.Oh, well what's the ones people used to suck the coating off? Sorry, I just remember this being a thing. 
I could very easily be wrong (obviously) just wondering why this was done.I really never found there to be much difference, but even if there is, I can't imagine it's so significant as to make chewing that nasty tasting shit worthwhileYeah it is just cleaner to suck/scratch off the coating before crushing. You don't want to sniff the coating. However it doesn't matter if you crush with or without coating. The crushing is the point.Oh okay, thank you.

I started to get RLS after using fentanyl, and it just became a w/d symptom from any opiates I used after that. 400 to 1000mg of gabapentin before bed and my body would get really warm (not like overheating...like the skin around the areas of my body that swing violently in the night, my legs especially) and then I'd stop beating up the bed with my body, I'd just get relief from that which to me has always been like the stuff holding me hostage, saying you don't want to use me anymore? That's cool bro, good luck living without me, good luck sleeping lol. Getting rid of withdrawal temporarily...I personally have never done it, but I've seen many people take ridiculous amounts of it, like 1000s of milligrams at a time, and said it allowed them to go about their day with a smile. Either way, since you have the access yo them, I'd defo give it a try.I have extreme chronic pain I want to add that I don't enjoy the "high" from perks ive been on them for 3 years and never ran out till tomorrow if things don't go righttry replacing Gabapentin with Pregabalin, Its more effective for Fibromyalgia and has a waay greater recreational value (:What do you mean by on its own? Originally this was a perception to take alone . Thanks for the advice !Maybe it's just me, but when I take gabas with red kratom it gives a euphoric effect. Might be worth looking into. Have a good oneTo each their own. But i disagree 800-1200 mg's gabbys usually help me with my wd's (and my bone pain) for at least a few hrs.Well for withdrawals I advocate a multi faceted approach. To whit:

An Alpha 2 adrenergic agonist to mitigate the excess of norepinephrine going ham in your brain. 

A benzodiazepine for anxiolysis and sleep. 

A peripherally acting Mu receptor agonist to mitigate the diarrhoea. 

Hyoscine for tummy grumbles and as a desiccant or sorts. 

A simple analgesic like paracetamol or ibuprofen for general aches and pains. 

A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for N+/-V. 

Quinine for muscle cramps (bonus you won’t catch malaria!) You may be able to convince your Doc to give it to you in the form of a Gin and Tonic cocktail. I doubt it, but worth a shot eh? Note to self, prescribe Gin and Tonic from now on...

Ya know, tackle the problem from a few different angles, get better results. But look if you’ve gotta do this without all that stuff, then gabapentin certainly has its utility. 

Merry Christmas �U tried pregabalin? @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Turning Heroin into Morphine?, Content: So I basically have never injected morphine and heard it’s kind of different, like you get pins and needles and everything. I’m curious to experience it and I hear if you let heroin sit in water long enough it’ll turn into morphine. How long do I let it sit to do that and how do I ensure it doesn’t have any bacteria or anything grow in it? Also I’m using tar if it that’s makes a difference cause I know it has 6-mam and some other alkaloids in it. Will those all successfully turn into morphine? 

I don’t care if it’s a waste of H or anything, I get it off onions occasionally so it’s not like I need to get my money’s worth out of every last drop or anything. On that topic though, how much does the potency drop? Assuming a fatter shot than I’d normally do?, ups: 2, downs: 0I have nothing to add except the following quote from a long since deceased former member of this very subreddit. They were referencing a specific situation and I feel this comment is apposite given the topic of your post. Please forgive my use of a potentially problematic pejorative term, although the person I’m quoting was in fact, African American and assured me I had “a pass” to utilise this word in the context of quoting him. As such, here are my thoughts on your proposed course of action:

*Nigga, that’s hustling backwards*...

Diacetylmorphine is however, stable in solution (under reasonable timescales) at physiological pH and a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and will retain approximately 98% potency in a 1mg/ml solution after 14 days. Higher temperatures appear to have an effect however. The same 1mg/ml solution stored at 37 Celsius (body temperature) for 14 days, remained 87% diamorphine. 

It doesn’t happen quickly, but the reason diamorphine is stored as powder in ampoules for reconstitution with a diluent, is that the ampoules are stored often for months or years before use, in which case, the degradation in vitro may be problematic. 

As for bacteria, micron filters, bacteriostatic water or saline would be a good idea a bit of alcohol could help to inhibit bacterial growth. 

Merry Christmas and good luck! � 

Edit: I added stuff after “the “N” word” because I figured I should actually help at least a bit.Keep shooting IV H until you get a severe enough abscess to require emergency surgical intervention? 

Works for me!!

Nah tho- sometimes in the south our BTH has a high morphine content that feels like you described however ..I mean.. Heroin is a prodrug to morphine, the only difference I've really noticed between the two is H has a more intense and IMO better rush. 

The actual effect of the drug once the rush has worn off is very very similar, at equal doses you'd be hard pressed to tell which is which without a good amount of experience with both.Anytime a white person feel validated to use the N word they just wind up looking more stupid than using It vehementlyLike I said I don’t really care about the money loss or anything, I just heard the morphine rush is unique and wanna experience it.Don’t do it very often homie, mostly smoke it whenever I get some and the shots I take I do with pretty sterile equipment. Last order I had was a couple months ago. Not too worried about getting an abscess. I don’t really ever miss my shots either.I mean u could prolly just buy morphine?Listen to the doc. Add if to excess warm water, put it in the oven on warm, and let it sit for a day to be sure.  Then let it cool to body temp, run it through a micron ($.50 on Amazon) and go to town.Exactly what the hell I was thinking or buy opium?Vials or morphine aren’t easy to come by.Wouldn’t want to IV opium or morphine pills and like I said the vials are hard to find.True @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Is H the most euphoric opiate?, Content: I feel like it is even tho I’ve never tried diamorphine. It just has this really crazy vibe to it., ups: 2, downs: 0In my opinion, it seems just as euphoric and addictive as hydromorphone and oxymorphone.  Many people actually prefer the morphones over heroin. Also, there's nicomorphine, which has the exact same mechanism of action as heroin, and seems to be identical to it. Desomorphine also seems to be just as euphoric as heroin, but even more addictive since it lasts three hours at best, so that the user needs to fix more often, and thus becomes more compulsive and obsessed with the drug.

The prohibition of diacetylmorphine is completely arbitrary. It's not that particularly dangerous opioid or anything, just a regular opi. In fact, it's just morphine with a more intense rush. That's what heroin literally is, a form of morphine that works quicker, that is able to pass thru the blood brain barrier quicker than regular morphine.

Now, Wikipedia says, "dextromoramide was singled out along with ketobemidone and several other synthetics by the United Nations and European Union as being "extra-dangerous" in the early 1960s, with dextromoramide being alleged to be three times more euphoric than heroin at equianalgesic doses."Pure, intravenous diamorphine is certainly up there in terms of things I would definitely do again if given the chance. Which is why all things considered, its probably a good thing that I don’t have access to it. 

Put it like this, if it was between a shot of pharma smack, or getting blown by the supermodel(s) of my choice, it’d be the smack hands down.OxymorphoneWhen injected i.v. it is one of the better ones.  Its mostly about personal taste tho too cause some people like the rush from dilaudid. Me, i used to prefer heroin back before ~2015, but nowadays its all fent analogues and ive had lots of fent analogue dopes that feel just as good as heroin used to.

I would say I.V. use is the most euphoric way to use opiates because theres at least a handful of fent analogues with just as good of a rush, but you have to iv. You just dont get a euphoric rush from sniffing smoking swallowing or plugging.

 You do get like 1/3-1/2 as strong of a rush with i.m. and s.c. injections, but iv is most popular for a pretty good reasonWhen I started snorting oxy it honestly was one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt. In the realm of opiates. Morphine, dilaudid, Vicodin, codeine, norcos whatever couldn’t compare. At one point during using it was hell to work even a 5 hr shift without railing anything even a pink. Anyways. Once I developed a slight dependency on it and my main dealer was going to be dry for an unknown amount of time along with all my other guys not replying or being dry I discovered that heroin was by far the most euphoric.
That’s just me though. I didn’t go back to ocs after trying it though and have been smoking for almost 3 yrs now.I don’t think it’s a fair question. To someone with a low tolerance, oxycodone or Vicodin would be the shit. To someone with a medium tolerance oxymorphone or hydromorphone. It’s all relative to how fast it gets in your system and how well you can hit the balance between not enough and overwhelmed, just my opinion. I say this because Vicodin gave me the most euphoric experiences.because of my low tolerance at the time. Followed by IV H and then oxy later on.As long as you don't IV I don't think so. Oxymorphone is way better than.Thanks for that, that’s some interesting information

Edit: and I agree with the arbitrariness of prohibition of that, but prohibition in general is arbitrary, I mean look at RC’s that are ‘legal’ just because that specific compound hasn’t been scheduled yet by the government, I fear the day they just make getting high illegal tbhI find it pretty cold to be fair - street heroin is better imo as it contains other alkaloids that combine to give a much more euphoric high. but  Dipipanone is pretty damn close and a better rushI agree with this. My best opiate highs were from percocet. They gave me mind blowing euphoria combined with amazing nods. By the time I got to heroin I had a pretty good tolerance. I have done some primo dope in my time (before the fent era) and I would say that nothing gave me that amazing euphoria like those percs did in the very beginning. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Does the opiates panel on drug tests include fentanyl?, Content: Quick question! Does the “opiates” panel on a 12 panel at home piss test include fentanyl? Or is it just codeine/heroin/morphine/etc..Thanks!, ups: 5, downs: 0Not usually on a 12 panel. Perhaps on a 15? The opiates panel is only for actual "opiates" and it will not detect synthetics like oxycodone, oxymorphone, fentanyl,  buprenorphine or methadone. Mainly morphine, codiene and hydromorphone and hydrocodone. Hydrocodone and hydromorphone are only detected in the opiates assay because of their metabolites, dihydrocodeine, norcodiene, normorphine and the like.if you get an at home test youll come up negative assuming its straight fent your doing.at home tests dont test for fentanyl unless it’s directly for fentur golden , juss be careful bro mane theres fents out there that narcan cant touchWow science girls do rock! Thank you so much lolNot even remotely true.  Almost any opiates section of even a DOT 5 panel will test positive for any common opiate including fentanyl. 

It might not catch a new one out of China but good luck predicting that.This if it's a at home one it most likely won't pop for fentOkay awesome thanks! It doesn’t have fent on the panelI forgot to mention that hydrocodone is a pro-drug for hydromorphone, so, hydromorphone is a metabolite of hydrocodone, one of the main ones, actually. 

Thank you!No, they won't.  Synthetic opioids like fentanyl,  do not have even remotely the same chemical structure as morphinian types. Dip stick UA cups use ELISA, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay Antibodies that are engineered to react with specific metabolites are what cause the positive result. In order for that antibody (which is a protein) to react with the enzyme it has to have a particular shape. Molecules with a similar active site can cause a false positive,  but you will never see someone test positive on the "opiates" panel for oxycodone, oxymorphone,  fentanyl,  methadone or buprenorphine.

You have to specially order a dipstick for fentanyl, methadone,  oxycodone/oxymorphone and buprenorphine.  That is why there are 15 panel dipsticks that have special assays just for these drugs.

Edited: autocorrect changed a word.. I had to change it back damn it!Thank yall for the replys! I hope it was straight fent it was a pressed mbox lol �So hydromorphone turns into hydrocodone when u take it or the other way around?You can literally Google any rapid cup drug tests and they will all test positive for oxy, hydro, and common fentanyl now.  I know, I tested positive for them.  

Everyone knows you are wrong.  Street fent can be a toss up and maybe the 12.99 test at CVS won't test for all of them but if anyone other than your mom is administering the test...it will be positive for any common opiate. 


If you think you can take oxy and then pass even a 5 panel, you are nuts.  Dont care what class you passed 15 years ago.Yes your good lol I used to pass every single one doing those the pressesPassed my ua while on them and had been on them for weeks.. 13 panelHydrocodone is metabolized into hydromorphone.Then Google it.And no. I am not wrong. If you google it, you get a list of a bunch of different drugs,  right? Well.. those drugs are all different assays, not a single one. You have to have an immunoglobulin created for the synthetic opioids specifically.  Opiates are morphine and codeine, which are indicative of heroin use. Opioids are everything else. Why, then, are there drug tests that have a different assay for oxycodone? Fentanyl? Methadone? Buprenorphine? Why would they bother with that if its all included in the opiate window?

Again, opiates are separate from opioids like oxycodone,  methadone, fentanyl...buperenorphine

Opiates. Heroin.  Fent. Just be careful. 


>I figure ingesting a good amount of fent would do the trick right?

Yep.


>That is the only substance that would be able to penetrate the bupe? 

I've seen heroin do it.


>Anything else would be pretty much wasting it and it wouldn’t provide relief right? 

Not necessarily. 

>Just looking for some knowledge on the subject just in case I ever have to go thru precipitated withdrawals.

Don't use subs. Use methadone and you won't have to worry about it.A "good amount" is a def over estimate.  But as the others have said only thing known to work (personally) is an opi. But a "good amount" could be a waste or could put you into a predicament.I can confirm that H / Fent will take away PWD but don’t expect to feel high, you just won’t feel like shitBupe has a higher affinity to the mu receptors than morphine/heroin so it would be difficult to negate P/w's. Dont get them in the first place is your best bet - as you know you have to be in w/d's before you take bupe - and take a small amount and build up that way you reduce the possibility of it ever happening. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Does weed kill oxy?, Content: I’m not a big oxy guy but I was gonna do some and smoke this weekend, I’ve been told weed kills opiates. Is that true?, ups: 2, downs: 0Personally weed/oxy cross fade is my favorite, but I dose oxy low and smoke a substantial amount of weedI've smoked like once in the last 10+ years and I definitely didn't feel any effects from my pain meds when I was high.  I have chronic pain & it actually made my back feel so much worse.  I know it's only 1 anecdotal experience, but I'd do them separately if it were me.I find opiates and weed to be my favourite drug combination, though it can be unpredictable. 

Usually smoking on a junk high increases euphoria, sedation and analgesia for me.

Occasionally though it just enhances the sedation and gives me intense anxiety about respitory depression that detracts from the high. 

The cough suppressant effect of most opiates is also handy as fuck when you're smoking that killer dank.No. I love the two together. 

Not much else I look forward to in life other than getting high.I never enjoyed the mix.  The weed always seemed to overpower the dope.Nah weed n oxy da bestI've always heard it enhances the high but I can't speak on it personally bc I can't smoke weed anymoreWhoever told you that doesn't know what they're talking about. Once I would smoke I would instantly start nodding. It's like that for me with Xanax too. I won't even feel it till I smoked. I dunno maybe that's just me though? But I highly doubt that it's just me.I can smoke weed all day and be good, but if I either do meth or heroin and then smoke, I get super fuckin high, like almost too much sometimes, almost makes me feel like I could OD, I dunno maybe that's just me but damn, it low key blows my mind every time I do it, I'll just play it off if I'm in a group, but I'll be thinking to myself, damn I might just end up dying right now and no one even knows what im feeling lolI think it may depend on the strain of weed but I’m definitely not outspoken on the whole “weed amplifies my pain” dealIt’s weird. Weed makes pain so much more noticeable to me.Perhaps it's been a while since you just smoked weed.  I'll tell ya, I'm only three weeks clean of opiates, but it seems the weed is so much better now.  I think maybe the opiates were masking a lot of the high of the weed for me.  But yes, they do go well together and getting high is something to look forward too!I was hoping it would help my pain since everyone always talks about how if weed were legal we could replace opiates for chronic pain with it.  But after how excruciating my back pain was last time I smoked, I don't think I'll be trying it again.Smoke weed every day. Heroin typically twice a week. I should say, get high as fuck on weed every day. I don't think opiates change anything but it could be different for you.Been smoking weed for decades and I can't say it does anything for pain.  Maybe because it tends to sit you on your ass, you don't do enough physical activities to cause pain?  I don't know, but I always had one eyebrow up when I heard weed can replace opiates for pain. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Outdated cough syrup help, Content: Ok maybe a weird place to ask but it does involve an opiate.

I have a very old cough juice bottle containing ethylmorphine, and its my last bottle. The problem is that the little cough juice that is left has been separated into layers, where most if not all of the active ingredients are either on top or on the bottom of the bottle in a crystal, wet powder mix. 

So my question is: Do you know a good method to make it a drinkable solution again? If not, how would I consume it? Thanks in advance!

Also for further reference: I live in Sweden and we have all our cough juice on receipt and you actually have to go to a doctor to get a new reciept, which I don't really bother to because I only use it to get to sleep when I'm on speed., ups: 5, downs: 0Shake it. If the crystals do not dissolve,  you can try adding a little water and then gentle heat. Low low heat!! And constant stirring.I would say shake that bitch to mix it all back together and then chug itSounds amazing, it’s probably a lot more potent since it’s old.Right on the money with this comment.Why would that increase potency? I have no knowledge on the subject, just curious.I haven’t a single clue, boyfriend found an old bottle of syrup a few months back with a pretty small amount in it and felt like he was gonna die (in a good way). Also wolf of wall street where they take the old quaaludes thinking they were less potent when it was in fact the oppositeMaybe some of the inactive ingredient evaporates over time?They got so fucked up because they kept popping more, only the time release was fucked. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Just sad, Content: Idk if this is the right sub for this but man im just so tired of being an addict. For the past 10 yrs its just a cycle of having fun getting high then eventually shit gets really bad and getting high is no longer fun at all. Then i get sober and everythings great sober. Then i decide its ok to get high a few times and boom the cycle repeats. 

Everyone i know that got high on opiates before either got sober or died. As much as i enjoy the high its just not worth it for me anymore bc i cant control my usage ever. I cant just do it once in a while to have fun on a weekend. And tbh idc if i have to live without opiates. I want nothing more than to stay sober and live a normal life like everyone else. I want to be proud of the person i am again. Being an addict really fucking sucks but if i could somehow find sustained sobriety id be so happy again.

Im lucky i have a good job and a lot of ppl who care about me. Im lucky my addiction hasnt ever led to jail or something serious but i know something bad is bound to happen eventually.

The only thing is that the monkey is on the back but you will be much more equipped to quit when you’re ready. It’s something to consider. And with methadone, you at least get that little feeling in the gut with slight buzz everyday when you dosei hate myself for the way i live and i live like this because i hate myself. i just wish i could find a way to love myself enough to want to stay sober for myself. i just know that if i keep living like this i will inevitably end up homeless, in jail , or dead. i would almost prefer the latter because then i wouldn't have to be in jail or homeless but at least i can still keep getting high until then. but do i really want to die? no I'm stuck with a primate instinct to want to survive. i just need to hone in on that instinct enough to quit getting high and to just remember how much more i hate myself when I'm getting high and that it won't make things better, just worse.Why not try to quit?

A lot of people have told me to get the pill form of codeine because it's cheaper (though I get my syrup from a dark web vendor who gets his OTC, so I don't pay much). I've experimented with both and I've came to the conclusion that drinking codeine is just better.   
two reasons:  
1.) It seems to kick in quicker, and smoother  
2.) It's INFINITELY more enjoyable than popping 4-5 codeine pills (I almost always get one stuck in my throat somehow too even though they're small).  


  
Is it just me who feels this way? And do liquid opioids kick in faster than pill forms?, ups: 2, downs: 01) It does not kick in quicker in liquid form. 

2) If you enjoy sipping lean more than popping pills, then more power to you and glad you found an ROA you enjoy. 

Liquid preparations frequently have a faster onset of action than pills. But there’s not a tremendous amount in it. But as mentioned above, this doesn’t apply to codeine. 

Source: Books and university and pharmacology and ridiculous mnemonics to try in vain to retain information long enough to pass the test.You're the GOAT.

Thank you for the knowledge.

Why does it feel a little better when I do it in liquid form? Placebo maybe?  


Maybe it's also because I sip on it instead of pop them all at once, so the initial onset feels "smoother"? This is coming from someone who doesn't like "hard" hitting drugs like xanax (did it once, hated it) and have preferred a slower "smoother" drug like Valium. Though I don't abuse any other drugs and try and keep my opioid intake down.   


May I ask , are you a nursing student or pharmacy student??No worries. 

Something like that. I’m a veterinarian. But for peoples.Awesome!  Great to hear man.  


Another Q, how long does it take to build a tolerance? I've done it off and on for a year 2-3x a week I'd say. Is building some tolerance normal ?  


200mg/codeine per use I'd say. I'd say it maybe feels like 150ish use to? Or is it mental? I feel like it has to be done every day to build a tolerance.It doesn’t have to be done every day to develop a tolerance, no. You generally need to dose daily or near daily for a period of weeks to a month before you become physically dependent and experience withdrawal symptoms with sudden or abrupt cessation. 

But tolerance (as distinct to dependence) develops rapidly with repeated administration of opioids.Okay thank you. I feel like I'm not an addictive personality type. I get anxiety if I feel "cravings". Only thing I've ever been hooked on was chewing tobacco in HS ( used it to cut weight for wrestling ). Got anxiety so bad I stopped doing it for weeks... Only benefit to having anxiety I guess lol

A tenth of a point? Less?


I have zero tolerance to opiates at the moment but recently came across a plug who sells H and have been itching to try it. I'd probably shoot it if that makes any difference, and at least then I'd be able to volumetrically dose it.

For the record I know this is probably a terrible idea and I should stay away.. I've had trouble with codeine in the past and it was hard enough to get off of,  my habit was around 500mg a day or more and I'd start withdrawals after about 12 hours. Took me a week to detox and it was a hell I don't want to go through again.

Thanks for any and all advice, ups: 0, downs: 05 years later: what sites do you guys recommend for gay4pay?Do you live in the US or Canada? I myself started doing opioids by injecting heroin mainline, but it was dope from the Netherlands. If your dope is from the US or Canada, it's almost suicidal to start doing heroin by injecting it IV, given the fentanyl plague spreading around.

Codeine almost doesn't even compare to heroin. It depends on your metabolism. Some people metabolize codeine into morphine very poorly, some people metabolize it very well. We don't know what's your case when it comes to this metabolization issue, so we just don't know how much dope you can handle.

And there's other factors, such as the unknown purity of your heroin. Start by taking it a dose the size of a match head or even less than that, but be aware of how risky and easily deadly is the situation you're putting yourself in.Yeah man codeine doesn't really compare to heroin at all I wouldn't even feel safe trying to estimate a dose for you because idk if you're getting fentadope or straight fent or what[deleted]I can't argue against you doing this enough, it's an absolutely awful idea in a myriad, potentially deadly waysJfc �‍♀️*writhes hands*

Jackpot...If I wanted to do that I'd just get on Grindr, no big dealI'm in Canada. I'd say I metabolize it really well based on my history with it.

What's the size of a match head equate to? I figured I'd grab a point, split it in half, toss in 80iu of water which I imagine would work out to a full syringe and then backload another syringe with 10 to 20iu (should work out to 0.005 to 0.01g) and go from there. 

I realize how risky and deadly this could potentially be but I'm trying my best to mitigate the risks as much as possible. Im not dead set on trying it, I'm really actually fighting the urge to try because I know what can happen.. I'm just curious to know thingsI'd say there's probably a good chance it's cut with fent, pretty much everything is nowadays around these parts isn't it? Also just judging by who I'd be grabbing from I don't imagine them as the kinda person getting pure HWhy is it a terrible idea though? I can more carefully control the dosage and it's just another roi. What exactly is a very small amount? I need numbersoh, you will.Think about what you’re saying man. You have a very very low tolerance right now. Not opiate naive, but close. Canada is better about, for example, making fentadope purple or pink to clearly mark it as fentanyl. This is not universal though, and there is a very good chance that you will get what looks like regular old heroin, and there will be fent in it.

So with a very low tolerance, you plan on injecting around 50mg of heroin/fentanyl with a very low tolerance. This is way too strong for you man, you will either die or feel way way too high and sick. Just think for a second, why would you go straight to shooting heroin when you have other options? Why would you want to get hooked on heroin when you said codeine withdrawals were awful?

You’re playing with fire and honestly, following this path will most likely result in your death, seeing how you seem really careless when it comes to opiates. I’m not trying to be an ass, it just makes no sense that you’d want to pick up a deadly IV habit for no reason. If you really wanna do this shit, PLEASE snort it. Make one, VERY small bump/line. Like, so small that you probably think it wont get you high. If it’s strong heroin/fent, after one or two of those you will probably already feel plenty high. Please be careful man, people that have done heroin for years and years still end up dying from fentanyl.Yeah basically everythings cut the only stuff I had that tested negative for fent was from the DNM so you'd have to be even more carefulSpeaking from experience?I was thinking of shooting 5mg not 50mg. I am not trying to come across as careless that's not my intention, I apologize if that's the case. I do care. I don't want to die. Main reason I want to IV it is because I can control the dose a lot better than I can by simply eyeing out a "tiny amount", and because I am not new to iv drug use, I've just never shot up any opiates before. Believe me if I was totally careless about it I wouldn't be on here asking for dosing advice. I appreciate your response.Experience that you'll share soon enoughyeah, we all do.Oh, I misread the dosage there, my apologies. I don’t mean to come off so strong, this is just such a deadly serious thing, and I’ve had friends pass in similar circumstances to yours. I just really don’t want to see another person die if I can try to help it.

I understand what you’re saying in terms of achieving a proper dose, however you can do that with insufflation too, just with a lower bioavailability. Since you’ve IVed before, I’m sure you know the risks of getting hooked on the needle. Good luck man, whatever you choose to do :)Well I appreciate your vote of confidenceNo worries man I appreciate any and all responses. I still haven't made up my mind whether or not I'm going to do it - but if I choose to I just want to be as informed as possible. One of the reasons I want to IV it is because well, I love iving, the needle already has me hooked you could say.

I guess I could always just squirt a few ius up my nose (I've done that before with research psychedelics like 25i). I just want the rush. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: My dboy just texted, "Waiting on you", Content: Did I wake up in an alternate universe?! WHAT IS HAPPENING., ups: 15, downs: 0Funny I just talked to mine for the first time today when yesterday he told me to call him in the morning. I drive to the spot and call him and he says “call me in 30 minutes.”


God damn this shit gets old.Damn lol. OP’s lucky (today), but your comment just made me depressed for past me, lmfao. 

If and when you want to get off opiates, you can do it man. Just sayin. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: My girlfriend went through my wallet, Content: She said she wanted to clean it out. She found three different casino membership cards, psychiatrist’s card, sub doctor, my attorney’s business card (she didn’t notice it was tar stained), some card for the suicide hotline, old condom. Oh and the debit card they give you when you get out of jail. Like I walked into jail with a bunch of cash and when I walk out I expect the cash you asshole, instead I get handed some bullshit card. 

I’ve been clean for a long time so I just didn’t expect my wallet to make me look like such a degenerate. At least the needle exchange membership card wasn’t there anymore. Only other thing amiss is there’s actually a bunch of money in it these days. 


Anyway, if you ever think you can’t get out and live a semi-normal life, you can, and you’ll get there. But it’s funny to see these reminders of how you used to be., ups: 141, downs: 0The jail keeps your money here, they apply towards your bill. I would rather get a card lolYou know your not doing well when your rockin the food stamps card in your wallet.The jail here gives 41$s a day towards your magistrate level fines. If you have fines through the clerk of courts and have a warrant with them then you can either Get work release or set up payment arrangements if they are willing to let you go If the fines are Not to high. Anyways, if you go with cash you get a card when you leave. It used to be that if you went with cash they would print you out a check and then you could cash it across the street at the bank and if you didn't have an ID it would be ok. They would cash it anyways.The jail takes half of whatever cash you had when you were taken inDump her for going thru your walletHow considerate they are of the working man...Lol that’s funny. I remember when my mom and I cleaned out my purse and there was like 50 needles and 3 burned spoons and my sharps card, and omg when I cleaned out my car I just about cried. There was little brown stains everywhere, from checking if my needles were clogged by squirting them a bit, I couldn’t get them all but luckily it just looked like spilled soda. I ended up giving my sharps card to a friend when I got on methadone because I wanted her to start using smart and she wasn’t comfortable with going and getting her own sharps card (giving her name and shit). And in my state all you have to do is show them the card, you don’t have to provide proof of ID or anything. (It’s probably that way everywhere.I love this post <3Haha thanks for sharing. Pretty sure I’ve got 3/4 of those cards still in my wallet too. (Subs doc, attorney & psych) ... gonna just go ahead and throw those out now while I’m thinking about it! Not like I can’t just google them. Will be hanging on to the bail bond receipt to get that $$ back though lol.If my gf tried going through my shit. Id tell that girl its straight plasma centers, needles exchanges, a solid list of numbers with names that are obviously not real, gotta  say I was a frequent flyer at taco Bell if you know what I mean. 

Bitch you suspicious here ya go, I shoot heroin and like it. That's a first world problem. Wanna go through it sure, you know what to expect. Sorry prostitutes got good connects. Get with the game hoe, you about to turn a trick before you can even blink.

Edit: lawyer is on speed dial, money speaks apparentlyBill? What bill? I’ve never heard of you having to pay for jail.Same hereAlright I concede that is beyond fucked hahahaYou get your bail money back if you dont go thru a bondsmenOh shit!! Lmao I lost my EBT card back in 2013 and just never bothered getting a new one. How could I forget about thatMy county gives you a check for your cash less jail rent. The problem is that they release you at 12:01 am. Where can you find a check cashing place that late?What does that mean exactly? 41$ a day towards your fines? Is the they charge you $41 a day up to the amount of your fine and then you don't get charged more? I'm just now learning that jails are charging people to be locked up there like it's the fucking Knights Inn or some shit. This really makes me angry that they charge you to be in jailLmao right??What the fuck? "Get with the game hoe, you about to turn a trick before you can even blink" is that how you treat your girlfriend? ChrissakeThey charge us 
$31 a day to stay at their lovely jailI went to jail with no money and left with a fucking bill.Here they charge you $17 if you bring cash into jail. It covers the cost of underwear, a white T-shirt, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste and socks and shower shoes and your net bag. It probably costs them $8 for all of it.Ok. I know it's probably karma suicide. As someone who was lucky enough to never get caught up in the dirt I did as a younger and more strung out version of myself; I can say that I have never been to jail. THANK GOD. But, I can't be mad that they actually charge the inmate to stay there. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what it costs taxpayers to support an inmate. Free medical care, meals, etc. are things we could all get used to. I just think it is important to think about our struggling veterans and senior citizens, who are having to choose between eating and insulin before being so pissed that an inmate isn't getting a full free ride. U/deslondes704, this isn't directed at you. I just stopped on your comment and responded.Yes it isHere in Germany you get money for every day you are there. I think its 30€. I never went to jail but some friends of me. Thats super fucked up to pay for staying at a fucking jail.What the fuck? They kick you out at midnight? That’s fucked. That has problems written all over it if you don’t have someone who can get you cab or otherwise. And no money...It was a joke on a fucking sub reddit. Don't get your panties in a knotch. No harm intended. I treat women like women should be, with up most respect. I thought the joke was appropriate for the situation but indeed now I am the asshole. Sure, I'll own it.You from the States? It's all such a cash cow for them it's disgusting, not to mention crooked as fuck. I actually feel for everyone who lives there.Fuck that. Guess when I file bankruptcy do to an extreme medical bill down the line I’ll just add that to the chpt 7.Is it one of those private for profit jails? Or are those only prisons? What do they do if you can't pay, they can't hold you longer can they? What the fuck type of country do I live in that we charge people to go to jail. Now I've never been myself but I've read about it on here and I love watching those lock up shows on MSNBC. They charge an arm and a leg to call your family, I see that now in some places you don't even get in person visits, its in front of a video screen and I'm sure they charge for that...

With each and everyday it becomes clearer and clearer that the rich in my country are out to fuck the poor any which way. They will step over you and put thier boot on your neck to get another dollar. Fuck that man, i am sorry to hear thatThat's cheap! They charge $50 here!I did a county year and they tried to bill me like 20 k lmaoThat's more than my rent.In Arizona it’s almost 200 a day �Jeez. Motel 6 ain’t even that much a night.They give us $25-50 a day credit (depending on county) to stay in ours.  BEST DETOX IN THE COUNTRYWhaaaat. I wasn never charged money for jail. I was indigent for getting my wisdom teeth removed before my end of 7 months. Still no bill after. In Texas.You may  be thinking of prison when you think of all the wonderful "benefits" of jail lol. County jail has the utmost, bare minimum, save-you-on-death's doorstep medical care possible. In fact, there are many cases of people dying in county jail for very preventable reasons only because their numerous cries for help were straight up **ignored**.  In less extreme cases, it is still medical care that barely cuts it. Have anything wrong with your teeth at all? It's getting pulled. Do you wear glasses? Did you bring those glasses with you to jail? You aren't getting them for at least a month. Oh you're blind? that sucks. Do you take any medication that isn't directly going to kill you if you don't have it? (diabetics and insulin) You aren't getting it until you see the resident doctor or psych. Guess how long that takes? Yep at the VERY least a month. Took me 2 months to get MY anti-depressants that were already prescribed and I'd already been taking.

Free meals? I will tell you right now that the free meals are something that you wouldn't eat on the outside even if you were hungry. I've met people who were homeless that directly came to jail that wouldn't eat some of the trays. That means last week these people didn't know where their next meal was coming from and they still didn't want to eat the trays. The county jail gets creative in finding ways to fill 2000 calories a day in the cheapest way possible.

Plus, do you know how expensive jail already is? It cost me $4 for a 15 minute phone call and that's on the low end. Many counties in the US have $8-$15 rates for a 15 minute phone call. Before you start doing mental gymnastics to justify this somehow many counties have been sued (successfully) for these obviously exorbitant rates because it is fucking extortion.

All the food on commissary is twice as expensive as it should be, you need to buy any comfort medication you need (advil, tums, pepto). The tablets they give you? It's another huge money grab. I don't even need to get into the prices.

You're argument is flawed in a lot of ways. Why do you think money that inmates are forced to pay to a county jail would ever go to helping veterans or the elderly? Why do you think in  such a corrupt, terrible system that money would go to anything other than making that jail and everyone involved with all of it's backroom deals wealthier? Why do you think the programs already in place for veterans and the elderly don't suffice.

If you do opiates you are LUCKY that you haven't been to jail. If you haven't quit for good don't think it can't happen to you. The cops ARE NOT your friends. The politicians ARE NOT your friends. The system IS NOT your friend. Don't **EVER** get it confused.

Edit: I see you're part of the methadone program. A quick google search shows you have [similar odds of incarceration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667939) as any other addict. Even if you are living completely clean the cops in my town wait outside the methadone clinics and in surrounding parking lots and pull over anyone leaving within 30 minutes of them walking out the door and charge them with DUIs. Drug DUIs in my state carry a mandatory minimum jail sentence in my state. Don't ever get too comfortable. Even if you take your methadone and just go outside you can be charged with public intoxication or other summary offenses. If you’re on probation then you are going to jail. 

You said law abiding citizens don’t just get snatched up and put in cells. While it’s not black and white, reality is closer to this than you think.this might have a hint of truth if everyone one this thread hadn't gone to jail for a drug related incident. Keep in mind that jail is the government locking you in a cage, sometimes for good reasons but often for bad. Using a substance they don't deem acceptable is not a good reason to lock a human being in a cage.Inmate's don't choose to be there getting a free ride though, you are forced to be there. Prisoner.Yeah. They consider any part of a day as a full day served. So they release you at one minute past. They say it saves breakfast money and the weekenders can go to work on Monday.*utmostUp most lol r/boneappleteaI didn't get it. That's not a funny joke at all. I mean, I absolutely believe you were just talking shit and aren't smacking up your ho, I don't think you're some evil pimp, it just was a bad joke, that didn't read as a joke.Yes I am and you are correct, it's all racketIt truly is completely fucked, the police in the US are in no way here to protect us, the US supreme court has even explicitly said that. The police forces across the US are nothing but cash machines for the government. It is absolutely disgusting. Not to mention theres not a sliver of actual rehabilitation in the prison system, hence why our reincarnation rate is through the goddamn roof.We should start a “save the Americans” initiative. We’ll start with free health care and free prison time for all!Cant do that lol government loans, like student loans or owing for jail time. The government debts arent affected by bankruptcy. They make sure you're totally fucked.My guy, if the prisoners don’t pay for themselves, you pay for them. 

I’m sorry, but if you or I get caught, we should pay our own way through punishment. 

That’s how it’s supposed to work.No, county owned. Only video visits but we got tablets in the cell and we get 4 free a week (60 minutes total) anything more is $3.75 a minute.  They take half your money that gets put on your books and charge you when you leave, but can't stop you from leaving of courseHow’d you get out of it?Which county? I never got charged for staying in jail, I’ve done 9 months total...lol hey don’t speak too soon- ya might be getting a bill in the mail one day �Agreed.And since I can't find the post calling me a troll, I will leave this here, too. Forgive me for thinking that people should own their faults. Fuck knows, I've done my share of paying for my sins. I guess it's the difference between a grown-up mindset and, well... All that. I still stand by what I said, consider the sources, and move on about my day.But, nobody forced you to break the law. This lack of accountability is why jails are so crowded now. You can't tell me a law abiding citizen is snatched up and forced into a cell while minding his own business. Preposterous!*knot"Panties in a knotch" is the best one herePrison isn't rehabilitation, and the gov. Knows that. Even where I live probation is a set up. 

I saw on the tv the other day this guy had editable lollypops and the cop was like each one of these is a felon. And treating the guy like he murdered somebody.

The war on drugs in the states explicitly started to raise funds for the USA government it's actually fucked. And Trump doesn't make it better> the police in the US are in no way here to protect us

thats honestly a pretty ridiculous statement. Just because you're mad about getting busted when you break laws doesn't mean they don't protect people. I can link thousands of examples of police stepping into the line of fire to protect the citizens.I don’t believe that’s true at all because I just read an article on it and only 7% of people ever pay their bill. 

Certainly it can be cleared.MY GUY (lol) how do you type this out 10 minutes after sharing your sob story about your job prospects being ruined by pot possession?

My guys, I invite all to inspect the post history of [-Dubwise-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Dubwise-/) and marvel at the stark hypocrisy and douchey catchphrases, my guy.  

&#x200B;

TTFN my guys.Where i went to (denmark) i got paid for being there, not worth it at all but nice to get a lil something. It was about 2700dkk for a month, excluding snacks and cigarettes on fridaysOur county jail had tablets too but I was surprised to find out that it was privately owned. I thought it was owned by the state.You're a lucky duck.

Here in a specific county in the South part of Florida, you get two kiosks on the wall for the video calls, not tablets in the cells. Your people can go to a single location in the (quite large) county and do it free, or pay $6ish and do it on their own phone/computer. You get 30 minutes. No such thing as free communication. I think they might give you 1 or 2 stamped postcards in the indigency kit, but I am not even sure about that.Never responded to the bill they sent me and haven't heard from the since, that was about 10 years ago now.Nahhh im 3+ years past the last oneDon't kid yourself. 

Unless you get all of your pills prescribed to you and do not use any other drugs, you've committed a crime punishable by jail or even prison time.

Just because you've never been caught (yet, unless you're clean/100% prescribed and stay that way) doesn't mean you're any better than someone who got caught using.

Personally, my record is 100% small time drug possession unless you count a single silly incident that got dismissed.Any law that doesn’t have a victim is not a crime that should be punishable by jail - my .08 dui for an out taillight (and blow in system from previous night) after having possessions of marijuana charges previously shouldn’t be enough to send me away for 30 days or more and then forced rehab. 

It’s BS.No, but many ppl spend time in jail that they don't deserve. We pay fines and or restitution, why the fuck would we have to pay a jail bill on top of it allobvious trollloool editableThere is a stark difference between those two statements. 

You are comparing apples to oranges. 

I was arrested for possession, I completed my probation, which included weekly scheduled urinalysis that I personally paid for. I also paid two different fines and paid for lawyers. 

In total my restitutions were approximately $10,000. But I paid it myself. 

It costs over $30,000 to house an inmate in state prison for one year. If the inmate doesn’t pay for it, the tax payer does. Why should I pay for your incarceration?

As a society We tell offenders that they will be seen as whole after they pay their debt to society. But it’s not true. I paid for myself when I got caught, didn’t expect anyone else to pay for me. 

I complained in that post because I signed a contract with the state when I plead guilty. I kept my end, I paid my debt. The state didn’t keep their end, my possession charge is still haunting me 20 years later. 

You can have a criminal history, and still want the system to work. I’m not anti-law, I’m pro-reform.

Edit: expecting other people to pay for your fuckups is snitch mentality. You know the game has risks when you choose to play it. If you get caught YOU take your lumps and move on. You don’t get to put it off on someone else.What a crock of shit! Haha. They're probably like eh let's just send one and see what happens. 

You a Modest Mouse fan? Username has me wondering.I've been 100 percent legal eagle for 13 years. I haven't ever claimed to be better than anyone. But, bet if I got caught I'd own that shit. It's not about who's more wrong, it's about accountability.I agree with you, but I dont necessarily agree that a dui doesn't have victimsthat sucks dude, I can't even imagine.I'm not necessarily saying you should. I'm just saying I shouldn't. I'm not saying it's right for jails to charge inmates to be there. I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying, I would rather see the inmate be charged than someone who had nothing to do with his or her incarceration at all. The government sucks. Shit, maybe they should use all of that confiscated drug money and seized property to support the inmates, rather than expecting the money to come from people who don't have it.Lol I can't spell and auto correct fucks me up all day. �That's one way to think about it.  It still seems pretty hypocritical though. 

"Snitch mentality" lol.  The only one snitching is you on yourself.  Maybe it's not some perfect system of everyone owning their shit and accounting for themselves, but you gotta be smarter working within the confines of the system that exists.  Likely, neither of your cases would have ended with a conviction had you not pleaded guilty.  It sucks, I feel you, but save your castigations MY GUYNever thought I’d see mm mentioned in the opiate sub lolYea it's all a money grab for suckers who are dumb enough to make one payment,  once you pay once, your screwed, and modest mouse is my favorite band.If you don’t wreck and you simply get pulled over because of an out taillight there are zero victims. 

Certainly someone who is all over the road should get a dui even without crashing, but it’s ridiculous if you blow .082 a block from your house like I did all because the cop was fishing with the dumb excuse of an out taillight."I dont feel, and it feels great, I sold my atlas by the freight stairs, I do lines , and I cross roads,  I cross the lines of all the great state roads " � � � � � �And the writing in the stall said “we write our maps in the stalls”Such a great song. @@@@@@@@@@ Title: Why am I not having withdrawals?, Content: I use heroin regularly, about 50mg per day usually.  I've been using nonstop for about 2 months now, until a few days ago I finished off the last of it. It's taking forever to get more so I haven't used for 5 days now. I would've expected some sort of withdrawal symptoms but so far all I've had is cravings and brain fog.

&#x200B;

Am I just not using heavily enough to get withdrawals? I know a lot of people use a lot more than I do but still, I figured I'd at least be in for a bit of suffering. Really the main reason I haven't taken any breaks is fear of withdrawals, but honestly this isn't that bad., ups: 2, downs: 0It’s a Christmas miracle!! � 

50mg a day for 2 solid months should be causing you to feel *something* but hey, don’t question it. It’s like being told you’ve won the lottery, even though you didn’t buy a ticket.

Assuming you’re smoking or banging it, but still, even orally with diamorphine’s dismal oral bioavailability, there should be discomfort. 

Again, lucky you. Take care and Merry Christmas �you lost me at 50mg per dayIts possible that you are a special snowflake that somehow, managed to escape the chemical changes that occur when a substance is used daily over a long period of time.  Its also possible that what ever you were using was cut with an analogue that has a longer half life than normal. 

From personal experience,  I got dope cut with some fent analogue and it took 3 days before I started feeling withdrawal. Granted, I had only used for about 5 days and had previously been on suboxone for several years, but still... after being off bupe for 9 days, I should have had mad withdrawal symptoms, but didnt.Is that all you have done? Like did you use opiates other than H before? Also are you sure that you had real stuff?It’s because of your low tolerance and short time using it. 50mg per day is really low, that’s just a few lines. When I had a serious habit, I was looking at about 300-400mg per day, sometimes more.

Having said that, I would think you would still feel at least kinda shitty. I would take it as a great blessing and stop using tbh. Or don’t, you’ll do it when you’re ready. But if you continue, you probably won’t get another chance like this.

Just something to considerLmao. Your comments are always hella informative and witty. Rock on Palladium �He is using a nickel worth a day or .05 on the scaleYou absolutely can get WDs from 50mg a day. I have a very low tolerance. Can nod from 20mg but am still highly physically dependent. My withdrawals are pretty heavy.yea i know. the joke was that i cant imagine anyone just doing a nickel per day for two months straight. but i guess its possible. most addicts build tolerances. because that's what happens when you do it all day @@@@@@@@@@
